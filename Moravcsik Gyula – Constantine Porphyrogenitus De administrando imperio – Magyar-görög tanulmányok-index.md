FOREWORD
In publishing this critical edition and translation of the text of the treatise De Administrando Imperio, compiled exactly one thousand years ago by the emperor Constantine VII, we feel that we should explain how our work began. The editor of the Greek text started to work on it as long ago as 1926 ; but the carrying out of other academic projects interfered during many years with completing the collection of his material, and bringing it into final shape for publication. Then, the latter years of the world war made completion and publication alike impossible. Fortunately, however, the ms. survived the siege of Budapest; and immediately after the war efforts were again made to finish the work, and the question arose of bringing it out. The first draft of the English translation was made independently. But while its publication was under consideration, chance brought it into relation with the publication of the Greek text. In the pursuit of our common purpose, we established contact with one another, and agreed that text and translation should be published together, believing that an edition of a Greek text is incomplete without a translation, and having in mind that, apart from the old Latin versions and those in the Russian and Croat languages, there is still no complete translation of the treatise in existence. From the beginning of 1947 we have worked together, through the medium of correspondence, to bring text and translation into line with one another, and have thus been able to subject the work of each to the revision of the other. Doubtless both parts of the work have benefited from this revision. Certain deficiences came to light in the Greek text, and the editor owes some corrections to the translator, who has also contributed a few conjectural emendations to the apparatus. At the same time, the translator wishes to own a special debt to the editor, whose long study and deep knowledge of the text have assisted in solving many difficulties of interpretation ; and though the translator takes

responsibility for everything printed in the English version, he is happy to make this cordial acknowledgment to his senior colleague. Edition and translation are complementary. For all that, their purposes are not quite identical; and it has been necessary that a few corruptions and errors which stand in the text of Constantine should be corrected in the version. We have therefore printed in italic those few words or phrases of the translation which do not correspond exactly with the text. References to the present edition are cited by chapter and line of the chapter; in such citations the letter «P» stands for uProem» (Tlgooíptov) i. e., the introductory passage which precedes chapter 1. Fifty years ago two scholars, the Hungarian R. V á r i and the Englishman J. B. B u r y , were already concerning themselves with the preparation of a new edition of Constantine. In bringing to fulfilment what they were compelled to abandon, we dedicate this work to the memory of both. Budapest — London 15th of March, 1949.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION
The emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus1 (905—959) was the second and only surviving son2 of the emperor Leo VI, surnamed the Wise, (866—912) by his mistress and later fourth wife, Zoe Carbunopsina.3 Constantine’s early life was clouded by a series of misfortunes for which he himself was in no way responsible. His constitution was sickly, and he was indeed invalid throughout his life.4 His father’s birth was doubtful; and he was himself born out of regular wedlock, although his legitimacy was afterwards grudgingly recognized. From his eighth to his sixteenth year he was the pawn by turns of his malignant uncle Alexander, of his mother, of the patriarch Nicholas and of the lord admiral Romanus Lecapenus. After the seizure of power by the last of these in the year 920, he was for the next twenty four years held in a degrading tutelage, cut off from all power and patronage, and, though married to the usurper’s daughter Helen, demoted successively to second, third and even fifth place in the hierarchy of co-emperors. It was not until January of the year 945, at the age of nearly forty, that, with the aid of a clique of guards officers devoted to his house, he was able to expel the Lecapenid usurpers and seat himself in sole majesty on the throne that was rightfully his. For the next fourteen years he governed, or seemed to govern : for the substance of power appears to have been in the hands of the Augusta Helen, of the hetaeriarch Basil Peteinos, of the eparch Theophilus, of the sacellarius Joseph Bringas, and of the protovestiary Basil,

the emperor’s illegitimate brother-in-law.5 These made or marred — for the traditions are conflicting6— the internal administration. The church was scandalized by the impieties of the worldly patriarch Theophylact; he, dying in 956, was succeeded by the ascetic Polyeuctus, who soon showed that stiff-necked king Stork might be worse trouble than dis reputable king Log. But abroad the imperial forces, under the leadership of Bardas Phocas and his two sons, and of the protovestiary Basil, continued, with occasional set-backs, that glorious career which had begun with the accession of Michael III and was to terminate only with the death of Basil II. The sole major disaster recorded of the reign was the failure of a costly but ill-led expedition against Crete in 949.7 During these years the emperor devoted himself with tireless zeal to the minutiae of every department of administration, and to the punctilious observance of every kind of imperial ritual.8 His greatest personal contributions to the prosperity of his empire were externally, in the sphere of diplomacy,9 and internally, in the encouragement of higher education.10 His relaxations were the pursuits which had always lain next his heart, and which, during the long years of his enforced seclusion, he had been able to cultivate without interruption : art, literature, history and antiquities.11 He found domestic happiness in the society of his three daughters, whom he tenderly loved ;12 nor is there evidence that his relations with his wife were other than uniformly affectionate, despite a difference of temperament.13 With his only son Romanus he was not so fortunate. To fit the youth for his future lofty station, he lavished on him a wealth of minute instruction14 which was probably excessive and certainly fruitless. The boy grew up spoilt, wilful and perhaps vicious; and married a commoner, Theophano who turned out to be one of the ablest and one of the worst o! Byzantine princesses..

By the age of fifty-four the emperor was old and worn out. His fourteen years of power had been years of ceaseless toil, and his infirmi ties grew fast upon him. A quarrel with the patriarch Polyeuctus, whom he seems to have had in mind to depose,15 occasioned a journey to the monks and hermits of the Bithynian Olympus ; and from them he learnt the mournful tidings of his own approaching dissolution. He dragged himself back to the City guarded of God; and there, on the 15t h of No vember, 959, he died.16 In person, he was tall, broad-shouldered and erect in bearing, with a long face, an aquiline nose, blue eyes and a fair complexion.17 Of stainless morals, deep piety and unremitting devotion to duty, he was an emperor after the hearts of his people, who testified their affection by a spontaneous outburst of grief at his funeral. The favourable and the unfavourable traditions concerning the character of Constantine VII provide no mutually incompatible ele ments.18 They show him to have been a weak and retiring personality, artistic, studious and laborious. If he drank wine to excess, it was his antidote to shyness. If he had fits of severity, even of cruelty, they were the obverse of his diffidence. His love of learning was inherited from his father, and was confirmed by seclusion. His lack of self-confidence was inveterated by his long durance in the hands of the Lecapenids. Yet in those years he was amassing a wealth of historical and antiquarian knowledge which bore fruit in those encyclopedic manuals and historical studies to which we owe the chief part of our knowledge of the machinery and organization of the mediaeval empire of East Rome. His achievements in the cultural field were indeed immense. Of his patronage of the manual arts this is no place to speak. But of his encouragement of learning and research a word must be said. Himself deeply versed in classical learning,19 his liberal intelligence comprehended both the theoretical and the practical aspects of knowledge, the know ledge which was good in itself, and the knowledge which was necessary to enable the practical man to arrive at a correct decision in the affairs
18 Cedrenus, II, p. 337 ; Theoph. Cont., pp. 463 ff. 18 The symptoms recorded (Theoph. Cont., p. 464) do not seem to support the later allegation that he was poisoned. 17 Theoph. Cont., p. 468 ; cf. J. L. Myres, Who were the Greeks?, (Berkeley, California, 1930), p. 203. These details bear on the paternity of Leo VI, whose eyes must have been caerulei, since those of the Carbunopsina were, ex hypothesi, dark brown or black. 18 Rambaud, op. cit., pp. 41, 42. 19 Zonaras, (ed. Bonn.), I ll, p. 483.



of life.20 To the latter branch, which was principally concerned with the study of history,21 he devoted especial attention ; and from among the graduates of his university, of which he was, after the Caesar Bardas, second founder, he chose his higher bureaucrats and churchmen.22 To this practical education he naturally subjected his son Romanus also. If such knowledge was important for the governed in the conduct of their individual, everyday lives, how much more important was it for him who should govern all !23 How essential was it that decisions which would affect the wdiole world should be dictated by the utmost practical wisdom, sharpened by the widest experience and knowledge of every similar decision or parallel set of circumstances in the past ! This belief in the practical value of learning and education, which is set out at full in the preface to the De Administrando Imperio and repeated in many subsequent parts of the book, was, of course, derived through Plutarch24from Aristotle ; and the method of education through the early inculcation of precept, which is illustrated in a long series of mediaeval manuals of gnomic wdsdom, goes back ultimately to the Ad Demonicum25 of the Pseudo-Isocrates, which, with the Latin Disticha of Cato, formed the basis of primary education throughout later mediaeval and renaissance Europe. But to Constantine may be given the eredil for its revival at Byzantium ; for, to teach practical wisdom, the material for such teaching is required, and was in his time extremely scanty. With tireless zeal he set about the enormous task of creating such mate rial, and set about it in three ways : first, by diligent search for and collection of books, of wdiich the supply was quite inadequate26; second, by the compilation of anthologies and encyclopedias from such books as existed but were too tedious or prolix for any but a scholar to read27 : third, by writing or causing to be written histories of recent events and3012

manuals of technical instruction on the various departments of business and administration.28 A school of historians wrote beneath his eye, sometimes at his dictation.293012Documents from the files of every branch of the administration, from the foreign ministry, the treasury, the offices of ceremonial, were scrutinized and abstracted.30 Provincial governors and imperial envoys wrote historical and topographical reports on the areas of their jurisdiction or assignment.31 Foreign ambassadors were diligently questioned as to the affairs of their respective countries.32 From every quarter the tide of information rolled in, was co-ordinated and written down. Learning became the key to worldly advancement.33 The principle laid down by the illiterate Basil I34 found its ultimate fulfilment in the educational reforms of his scholarly grand-son. This is the true glory of the Porphyrogenitus. It has been claimed for Michael Psellus that in the width of his interest and the depth of his learning he was the first man of the renaissance. That honour should be given rather to Constantine, the son of the pupil of the polymath Photius. It was Constantine who founded the libraries from which his successors amassed their learning. With him Byzantium, rapidly approaching the apogee of its military glory, reached the apex of its intellectual achieve ment, an achievement fostered by the devotion of a patron of the arts whose like the world hardly saw in the thirteen centuries which divided Hadrian from Lorenzo the Magnificent. The De Administrando Imperio,35 to give this nameless treatise the Latin title attached to it by Meursius,36 was written and compiled, as we know from internal evidence, between the years 948 and 952.37 It is a manual of kingcraft addressed to the youthful Romanus, the emperor’s son, and is in form, like numerous other contemporary manuals

on various subjects, avowedly didactic. It aims at teaching38 the youth to be a wise sovereign, first by a knowledge of past and present affairs, and second by giving him a summary of the experience of others in circumstances analogous to those likely to surround himself; so that, knowing what policies have succeeded or failed in the past, he may himself be able to act prudently and successfully in the future. The matter of this teaching is a political and historical survey of very wide extent, suitable to the training of one who is to rule the world. The preface divides it into four sections : the first, a key to foreign policy in the most dangerous and complicated area of the contemporary political scene, the area of the «northerners and Scythians» ; the second, a lesson in the diplomacy to be pursued in dealing with the nations of this same area ; the third and longest, a comprehensive historical and geographical survey of most of the nations surrounding the empire, starting with the Saracens to the south-east, fetching a compass round the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and ending with the Armenian states on the eastern frontier ; the fourth, a summary of recent internal history, politics and organization, within the borders of the empire.39 Upon the whole, these divisions are adhered to in the text as we have it.40 The method of compilation becomes clear from a study of the text, and, more particularly, of the language.41 To form his book, the imperial compiler has collected or abstracted a number of documents, reports or historical narrations of specific subjects, and arranged them according to his predetermined order. He has himself written the prologue and the short paragraphs which join one section to the n ex t; but he has not attempted to rewrite' in his own words the documents which he has chosen to make up the body of the book. This is the only possible explana tion of the multiplicity of styles represented in the various chapters, ranging from the formal, literary style of Constantine himself in his prefatory and conjunctive passages down to the very loose, colloquial idiom of ambassadorial reports such as that found in chapter 46. How the emperor would have rewritten his original sources, had he had the inclination to do so, into a homogeneous literary style, may be seen by comparing a passage which he actually did rewrite in his life of his grand-father with the same passage left without alteration in its original

form in the De Administrando ImperioA2 But since the object of the latter treatise is to teach, and not to make a display of fine writing, he is content to leave the bulk of the texts in their original language, and to make a brief apology43 for their unliterary form, a form of which in principle he by no means approved. That part of the book, therefore, which comes from the pen of the emperor himself is very small: apart from the preface and notes to which reference has been made, the second or diplomatic section, occupying the bulk of chapter 13,44 is the only piece of continuous writing which can with certainty be attributed to him. The sources of the various sections, where these are known, are noted in the apparatus to the present volume. But the peculiar con struction of the book, with its diversity of styles and often careless expression, calls for a note of explanation regarding the English transla tion. The chief value of the treatise to the modern historian lies in its third section, which provides information not found elsewhere about the origins and early history of many nations established on the borders of the Byzantine empire in the tenth century of our era. This information, valuable as it is, is often given in a style so careless as to leave many statements open to more than one interpretation. Chapter 39 is a notable instance of this ;45 but there are several others. Now, these statements have been, are and probably will continue to be the subject of contro versy between scholars of many nations ; and it is therefore our duty as translators, at whatever cost to elegance or even in a few cases to sense, to render as closely as possible what the text says rather than what we are disposed to think it means to say. Interpretations may be left to a commentary. If therefore our rendering is in some cases ambiguous, so is the original. If it often halts, so does the text. Jf it is often inelegant and uncouth, it is no more so than the Greek. Where our author is plain and even elegant, we have tried to preserve his idiom ; where he has left his sources to tell their own stories in their own styles, we have left them too. With all its inaccuracies and shortcomings,46 the De Administrando

Imperio, for the bulk and variety of its information on every branch of foreign relations and internal administration, must be allowed to be one of the most important historical documents surviving from mediaeval Byzantium, even surpassing the great Book of Ceremonies compiled by the same indefatigable author. Its very omissions, the lack of any histo rical account of Bulgaria or of an up-to-date appreciation of the Saracen power, have their own historical lessons to teach us: for these two long standing menaces to the empire had at length yielded, the one to the diplomacy of Romanus I, the other to the hammer of Gourgen. The first-hand information comes mainly from Italy, from the Balkans and Steppes, and from Armenia. In Armenia the advance of the Roman arms and the retreat of the Saracens involved a complicated Roman diplomacy in the numerous and jealous principalities beyond the eastern frontier. In a divided and enfeebled Italy, during the interim between the empires of Charlemagne and Otto, Byzantium was for the last time in its history a strong military and diplomatic influence. The only hint of anxiety comes from the north, where the watchful eyes of the foreign ministry observed intently the ever shifting kaleidoscope of the political scene, as Magyar and Slav, Russian and Pecheneg, Chazar and Alan made their complicated moves between the Caucasus and the Carpathians. There is no doubt that the De Administrando Imperio was a secret and confidential document. It tells too much about the principles of imperial foreign policy and diplomacy, especially in the first thirteen chapters, to be safe for publication. Knowledge of these early chapters would have been worth untold sums in blackmail to the Pechenegs. Moreover, in the Armenian chapters there are several traces of infor mation got through secret service channels,47 which the government must have been most reluctant to divulge. Nor is it probable that the outspoken criticisms which the emperor passes on his father-in-law and colleague48 were intended for general reading. These criticisms betray the justifiable resentment of a prince deprived of his throne by an inter loper during a quarter of a century ; but his strong regard for the imperial dignity would have debarred him from publishing this resentment to the world at large. This confidential character of the book, confirmed, if confirmation be required, by its manuscript history and by the circum stance that later writers betray no knowledge of it,49 enhances its value.

It is no partial document of propaganda, fudged up to impress domestic or foreign circles. Much of it is an honest appreciation of the contempo rary political situation, compiled from information upon which the government based its day-to-day foreign policy. And, as such, it is unique. Forty years ago J. B. Bury called for a new text of the work and for an up-to-date commentary upon it.50 The text, together with an English translation, we endeavour to provide, in the hope that students of mediaeval history, whether they are or are not Greek scholars, will be assisted by the light which it throws on the Eastern Roman Empire in the century of its greatest splendour.

The De Administrando Imperio is preserved in four mss.1 Three ofl these contain the full text, the fourth a part only. These mss. are :
P — codex Parisinus gr. 2009 : codex on vellum, of 211 numberedl sheets.2There are also some additional sheets, 4 at the beginning of the; ms. (3 vellum, 1 paper), and 7 at the end (4 paper, 3 vellum). The sheets! are of sizes varying between c. 23.8 cm — 24 cm x 15 cm. The first: three of the additional sheets are blank. On the recto of the fourth is a Greek table of the contents of the codex, in a later hand ;3 on the verso of the same sheet is gummed a small slip of paper, inscribed with the table of contents in Latin.4 On the first numbered page begins the first Greek text, which covers 4 pages (fol. l r—2V) ; it is entitled: ’Emoxoh) IJvOayÓQa Tigög A a td a («Letter of Pythagoras to Lais»), and is followed, still on fol. 2V, by a table which relates to it. The «Letter» and table have been published from this ms. by P. Tannery.56At fol. 3r begins the text

Manuscripts 15
of D. A. /., and it finishes at fol. 21l r. This text originally constituted an independent codex, with which the «Letter of Pythagoras» was sub sequently bound up, as is clear from the facts, a) that the numeration of the quaternios begins only at fol. 3r ; and b) that the beginning of D. A. /., that is to say, the first page (fol. 3r) of the original codex, is so much worn, and the handwriting so indistinct, as to require its mending in brown ink by a later hand. In any case, the «Letter of Pytha goras» is copied in a different, and in all probability a later, hand. The subsequent history of the codex gives us, as we shall see, some clue as to when the «Letter» became attached to the ms. of D. A. I. The text of D. A. /. ends in the middle of fol. 211r. The rest of this page and its verso, which, as it was the last page of the original codex, is very much the worse for wear, contain a number of notes in different and, in some cases, later hands. Of especial interest as casting light on the origin of the codex is that written on the then blank fol. 21l v by the actual copyist of D. A. /., in the same red ink which he employed for the initial letters and headings of the chapters. Some of the letters in this note are so much worn and so dim as to render them now almost illegible. The text of this metrical epilogue is as follows: 1BißAog xaia[ag]oq 2’Icoávvov rov Aovxa 3yoa(pfj(aa) %£Qolv 4oixoyevovq olüérov bMixa(ii)}. óvó/uau 6rov 'PoiCatrov f, which makes it quite clear that the ms. at one time belonged to the library of the Caesar John Ducas, and that the copyist was his own confidential secretary, Michael.6 Un fortunately there is no date, but the name of the Caesar John Ducas, references to whom in Byzantine sources occur between the years 10591081, proves that the ms. was copied towards the end of the XI century. This is confirmed by a dated note in a later hand on the same page, which contains a reference to the year 1098/9.7 Concerning the adventures of the codex during the Byzantine age we have no other information, apart from the evidence of marginal notes to be described lower down ; it emerges again only towards the beginning of the XVI century, when it was copied in 1509 by Antony

16 Critical Introduction
Eparchus, very probably in the island of Corfu (see ms. V below). Bv the middle of the century our ms. was in Italy, whither it had been broughl s perhaps through the agency of Janus Lascaris.8The first mention of it in Italy is in the catalogue of the library of Cardinal Niccolö Ridolfi.9 On the death of Ridolfi in 1550, it passed, along with others of his books into the possession of Pietro Strozzi, and later, in 1560, into the collection of Catherine de Medici. At this period some chapters from it were trans cribed by Andrea Darmari (see ms. M below). From Catherine’s library it passed in 1599 to the Bibliothéque Royale in Paris, where it was num bered 2661.101Now, since the relevant entry in the catalogue of RidolfiV library is simply a Latin rendering of the Greek note on the recto of the fourth fly-leaf at the beginning of our ms. (see above), and since thie entry notes D. A. I. only, we conclude that the «Letter of Pytha goras» was attached to our ms. subsequently to its being placed in the Bibliothéque Royale. This conclusion is confirmed by the circum stance that the present sumptuous binding of gilt red morocco bears' the cypher of King Henry IV (1589—-1610). This manuscript, some pages of which have been published ini facsimile,11 I have studied by means of photographic reproductions' in the Library of the Hungarian National Museum, and also by examina- f tion of the original in the Bibliothéque Nationale at Paris in 1936 andl in 1948. The text of D. A. 1. was, as we have seen, copied by a certain Michael Roizaites.

— 2113 ysvéoftcu)12 has another hand relieved him. The text is written in single columns, and the columns vary in dimension between c. 16—17 cms deep x 11—12 cms across. The medium is the usual dark brown Byzantine ink, save that initial letters and headings of chapters are in red, a detail which goes back to the original copyist. The script is a mixture of uncial and minu scule ; y, ö, e, C, r), x,X, /ll, £, n are written both ways indifferently; uncial forms of ß,<p,w are uncommon, and very rare are uncial forms of a, v, a, y. Here and there we find a cursive #, while r occasionally rises above the height of the other letters. Rough breathing is still angular in shape, but the smooth breathing is always round. The writing is either on the ruled lines or under them, but never above them. Ligature abbreviations are frequent; short-hand abbreviations and abbreviations by suspension occur rarely, and mostly at the ends of lines. The copyist is fond of special ligatures for ar, ua, rr, of kinds which occur in other contemporary mss. In the orthography the most notable points are these : iota subscript is never found, iota adscript once only (53382xojl). A s regards peculiarities of accentuation, we may note that proper names ending in -Irat in many cases carry the paroxytone accent in nom. and gen. plural (e. g. 22 IJax^Lvamrcu, 814 77arCLvaxíxcov, 53535 X eqocovlxgu, 5365 X eqowvlxcdv) ; while the genitive plural of paroxytone racial names in -oqis sometimes perispomenon (e. g. 2843 @Qayyä)v, 322XeQßÄcöv). The word etiel is occasionally accented with double stroke: étiéi (e. g. 4822, 499, 4913). With regard to misspel lings due to pronunciation, it is particularly noticeable that the copyist makes the same error consistently through a series of particular words or forms. Characteristic examples of such regularly repeated misspellings are : at for e at the end of 2nd person plural verbs (e. g. 827 ExaftÉ&G'dcu, 5370 fxá'&Exai, 53477 vnoÖEÍgaxcu); el for r\ commonly in the words eIxlc, rjxLQ (e. g. 136, 26e„ 29234), eltceq = t\7ieq (e. g. 3849, 50192) and eIq = fjg (e. g. 31x, 35i, 43187) ; and in the augmented forms of the verb aixöj (e. g. 29157 eIxlggxo — fjxr/Gaxo, 4229 EÍxrjGavxo = fjxrjGavxo, 50209 EixrjGaxo fjxr'joaxo); rj for el almost invariably in the infinitive forms -elv and -elv (e. g. l s nrjdafaovxyv, 479 ÖLanEGTjv), and quite often also in the words and fj — si (e. g. 1387, 29148, 4116), őfj — öel (e. g. 1319, 13149), and in the verb vTnqxo) — vtielxlo (e. g. 3838, 5029, 5081). Some confusion is seen in the use of el and rj in the different forms of the verbs Xa/ußavco and Xeljioj (e. g. P31XsLipexai = XrjtpExaL, 2554 gweXel^ t] — GWEXrjcp&ri, 29203ánoXEÍxpEG'&ai

18 Critical Introduction
άηολήψεσθε, 2 1 26 νπελήφθησαν — νπελείφθησαν, 2630 καταληφθείς = κατν. λειφθεϊς, 4622 κατεληφθη = κατελείφθη). ω is found consistently for o ii the -ονται termination of the 3rd person plur. pres. ind. pass. (e. g. 9X] κατέρχωντat, 3129 περισώζωνται, 3764 ενρίσκωντat); and often also in thi termination -ov of nom. neut. partic. act. (e. g. 967 έχων, 1399 κατελθών. 3758 άποβλέπων) . From verbs beginning with o the temporal augmen: is usually absent (e. g. 1351 διορίσατο, 2671 μετονομάσθη, 3046 όρμισαν), From the point of view of the history of Byzantine pronunciation it it 1 significant that in our codex we frequently meet with v for oi (e. g. 20 στνχήσας — στοιχήσας, 454 μυχευθησης = μοιχενθείσης, 51120 ήνυξαν ήνοιξαν), and vice versa (e. g. 935 προίμναν — πρνμναν, 2652 όμνοίοντες όμνύοντες, 53191 φροιαττόμένος = φρυαττόμένος). This proves that at th» period when the work was copied, the pronunciation of these two sounds was still identical (a modified u). An odd feature, which we meeJ here and elsewhere, is the frequent interchange between the forms ημείς anc υμείς (e. g. 2735, 4315, 5369). As regards consonants, we note uncertainty in the writing of double consonants (e. g. P27 άντιτάσεσθαι, 159 φοσάτον. 4223 έναλλασόμενοι, 919 iovvviov, 2822 νησσών, 4539 σήμμερον); and the;1 substitution of μθ, μη for νθ, vn (e. g. 13107 συμπεμθεριάσαι, 269 έμ Παλαιστίνη, 2776 εμπρώτοις); and of χν for γχν (e. g. 2997σπλαχνησθεϊς =j σπλαγχνισθείς). These details also throw light on contemporary pronun ciation. There is a curious use of v for y before y, κ, χ (e. g. 2773, Κόνκορδα, 2938 ένκρνμματα, 43113 διαγονγγνζοντες, 52u κονχυλευτα'ι); mo reover, while on the one hand the accusative sing, in a of 3rd declen sion substantives and the -θη or -η of the 3rd pers. sing. aor. pass, indie, add a v before a word beginning with a vowel (e. g. 1332βασιλέαν, 2649 ρίναν, 2665 θυγατέραν, 53317 νύκταν, 3233 έγεννήθην, 43177 άπεστάλην), on the other hand the v of the acc. sing, of μέγας (e. g. 929, 416, 46151), and of the 1st pers. sing. aor. pass, indie, drops off before words beginning with a consonant (e. g. 2728 ένομίσθη, 29J68 εδιώχθη, 53347 ήναγκάσθη). In the ms. we note several words erased, amended, completed or corrected. A detailed study of the original may identify traces of at least six different hands in the text and, besides, of five other hands which have added marginal notes. There is no doubt that the copyist himself made some erasures and corrections ; but from the styles of the handwriting and from other evidence it can be established that many alterations have been made by hands in the XIV and later centuries. In one place a margi nal gloss bears a date which proves it to have been written in 1361/2 (168). To determine the chronology of certain other alterations we may argue from the fact that in V, which was copied from P, we often find the



Manuscripts 19
true text as it was before correction, which proves that at least these alterations in P were done by a hand posterior to the date when V was copied, that is, posterior to 1509 (e. g. P19 έϋνών P V : έ&ών Py j| 3844 ό Άλμοντζης P V : Σαλμούτζης Py || 3849 Άλμοντζη P V : Σαλμούτζη Py). In the margins of the ms. are notes, some of which are from the hand of the original copyist, but others, as the style of handwriting demonstrates, from those of later readers, principally of the XIV and XVI centuries. Some of these notes are in Latin. In the marginal notes, too, we may distinguish at least six hands. Those which go back to the hand of the copyist are mainly chapter-headings and citations of the contents, which were added to the text either by collaborators of the imperial author or by later scribes and readers. At least one of these original notes is not contemporary with the work itself, as is proved beyond doubt by its reference to the Abbot John Tornices as holder of the office of Syncellus, an office which, as we know, was conferred on him about the year 979 ;13 this note, therefore, was written about three decades after the treatise was compiled. A list of these original comments, and the passages to which they refer, is as follows: l x Πε(ρί) τών Πατζινακιτών || 2XΠε(ρί) των Πατζινακιτών (καί) των 'Ρώς || 3ΧΠε(ρί) τών Πατζινακιτ(ών) (καί) Τονρκ(ων) Ο 4ΧΠε(ρί) των γ έϋν(ών) || 5ΧΠε(ρΙ) των Πατζινακιτ(ών) (καί) τ(ών) Βουλγάρων || 61Πε(ρί) των Πατζινακιτ(ών) (καί) Χερσωνιτών || 71/7ε(q'O τ(ών) άπό Χερσώνος άποστελλομ(ένων) βασιλικ(ών) εν Πατζινακία || 8 Χ Πε(ρί) τοϋ άποστελλομ(ένου) βασιλικ(οϋ) εκ τ(ής) πόλ(εως) διά τ(ών) ποτ(α)μ(ών) || 8 23 Πε(ρί) τοϋ κληρικόν Γαβριήλ || 9Χ Πε(ρί) τοϋ πώς κατέρχωντ(αι) οι 'Ρώς έν Κωνσταντινουπό(λει) || 922 Πε(ρί) τών λεγομ(ένων) καταράκτ(ων) || 939 Πε(ρί) τοϋ β' φραγμ(οϋ) |J 9i3 Πε(ρί) τοϋ γ φραγμ(οϋ) II 945 Πε(ρί) τοϋ δ' φραγμ(οϋ) || 957 Πε(ρί) τοϋ ε φραγμοϋ || 9β1 Πε(ρί) τοϋ ζ' φραγμοϋ || 964 Πε(ρί) τοϋ ζ φραγμοϋ || 972 Πε(ρί) τής νήσου καί τοϋ δρυός καί τών ϋνσιών || 9η4 Πε(ρί) τ(ών) Οϋζω(ν) || 104 Πε(ρί) τής Χαζαρίας || 11χ Πε(ρί) τής Χερσώνο(ς) καί τ(ής) Βοοσπόρον || 13Ί3Πε(ρί) τοϋ λαμπροϋ || 16χ Το ϋεμάτιν τών Σαρακιν(ών) (καί) ποιον χρό(νον) εξήλϋ(ον) II 2116 Διέρε(σις) τών Αράβων |[ 2137 ε άρχηγό(ς) ’Αράβων || 2149 Οϋτος παρεκάϋησε(ν) την Κωνσταντινονπο(λιν) || 229 £ρή || 2240 Πε(ρί) τής νήσσον τής Κρήτης || 2261 ^σπη || 316Διά τί λεγωνται Χρ(ω)βάτοι íj 33j 0 Πόϋ(εν) λέγω(ν)ται Ζαχλονμοι || 34χ Πε(ρί) έτέρ(ων) εϋνών || 3618Πε(ρί) τοϋ άγιον άπο(στόλου) Λουκά καί Παύλου || 3715 "Οτι η αρχο(ν)τες είσί(ν) εν Πατζιν(α)κία || 3733 "Οτι (καί) εις μ μέρη ή Παζινακί(α) ||

Marginal notes and textual emendations are especially frequent i the chapters dealing with the Arabs (14—22), a fact which, like the glos of the year 1361/2, mentioned above, suggests that this section of th treatise was at some time or another an object of peculiar interest t Byzantine readers. The original text has not merely been subject to emendations am alterations by later hands, but has also been touched by the hand c time. We have said that the writing on the first and last pages of thi originally independent ms. was so much worn and faded that it had t: be rewritten. Traces of such rewriting are observable in other parts of thi codex as well. Apart from these ravages of time, some sheets (fol. 59, 6 c 75, 80) have received such material damage through clipping of thi margins that the text itself is impaired and some letters are missing
V = codex Vaticanus—Palatinus gr. 126 : codex on paper of 27 numbered sheets ; 3 additional sheets at the beginning, 1 at the enc Sheets measure 21.2 x 15.4 cm. Ms. contains several works. After D. A. 1 which covers fol 2r to 127r, come works of Tzetzes, Theophrastus, Bes sárion and Nicolas Secundinus, though these have been copied by othe



M anuscripts 21
hands.14At the end of the text of D. A. /., at the botton of fol. 127r, are two notes in the hand of the copyist: δόξα τώ &(ε)ω τώ λόγον και γνώσιν τοϊς άν(ϋρώπ)οις δωρονμένω: αφϋ: ιονν(ίω) ε,χί έτελειώϋ(η) : αφνδ' ν μαΐω ιζ'Ώ. εγώ Αντώνιος ό ’Έπαρχος παϊς ών κατά το αφϋ·'ο ν έτος έγραψα τό ανωϋ(εν) βιβλίον: («Glory be to God who giveth understanding and knowledge to men: finish ed, 5th June 1509. — 16th May, 1554: I, Antony Eparchus, then a boy, wrote this book in the year 1509.») It was, then, the well-known huma nist of Corfiot origin, Antony Eparchus (1491—1571), who copied the ms. — apart from a single passage at fol. 16v (= 13192_197), which is in another hand — in the 18th year of his age ; three years before, in 1506, he had completed his ms. copy of the Gospels.15The ms. passed into the possession of John Egnatius (1473—1553),16 probably very soon after it was copied, since Egnatius in the book which he published in 1516 refers to it as being already in his library.17 It should seem that the second note, dated 16th May 1554, was penned when Eparchus, after the death of Egnatius, came across his own copy among the relics of the deceased. The codex next passed to the Bibliotheca Palatina at Heidelberg, where it appears in the catalogue compiled by Fr. Sylburg about the year 1584.18 From Heidelberg it was transferred in 1623, along with other mss., to the Vatican Library in Rome. In the margins of V, as of P, there is a number of notes in Greek and Latin, which are the additions of later readers. An exceptionally large proportion of these notes is appended to the chapters dealing with

A. /., which covers fol. l r to 80v, ms. includes several othe; works, such as compositions of Photius, Themistius, Choricius, Polybiui and Apollodorus.8119 The first part of D. A. I. (fol. l r to 16v) was copied b; Antony Eparchus, as appears from a comparison of the script witJ that of V ; the remainder (fol. 17r to 80v), together with the excerpt, of Polybius and the work of Apollodorus, which are together at the en» of the ms. (fol. 125r to 241r), is the work of another hand. Omont in hi. catalogue identifies this copyist as the Cretan Michael Damascene, bu. in the index of the same catalogue we find instead the name of Valerian« de Forli.20 A comparison with the script of the last named and witl other mss. of Michael Damascene21 shows that the copyist of the latte I part of D.

I have studied this ms. both through photographic reproductions and by examination of the original in the Bibliothéque Nationale at Paris in 1936 and in 1948.

2. EDITIONS
Of the Greek text in its entirety seven editions have hitherto been published. The first edition was published in 1611 by John Meursius (= Me) under the title «De administrando imperio»28 a title which he himself gave to the work and which has been since then generally adopted. In his notes he informs the reader that the basis of his edition was the Vatican ms. (= V), which was at that time still in the Bibliotheca Palatina at Heidelberg. Meursius worked on it by favour of the then

(P), and was thus able to introduce several! corrections into his text.33 Banduri’s edition was twice reprinted : an' uncorrected reprint appeared in 1729, in the Venetian collection of the: Byzantine Historians34, and in 1864 Migne republished Banduri’s text with a few corrections.35 The final edition was the work of Emmanuel Bekker (= Be),36 who did not divulge his methods, though it is clear that he did not useany fresh ms. material. Editions containing excerpted chapters only of D. A. I. have: generally followed Bekker’s text. Such are, e. g., the editions of Fr.

Vári was never published, and his ms. is in the archives of the Hungarian National Museum.48 The plan for a new critical edition of D. A. I. originated when the Hungarian scholar, R. Vári, at that time a young man, began preli minary researches in 1892 with a view to elucidating the ms. tradition.49 The plan next engaged the English historian J. B. Bury, who proposed to include the work in his collection of Byzantine Texts. But these projects came to nothing. Bury, in a letter dated 5,h October, 1925, announced that he had given up the plan of an edition, which he surren dered to me.

26 Critical Introduction
3. TRANSLATIONS
Of the full text of D. A. I. four translations have been published, two in Latin, one in Russian, and one in Croat. The first Latin rendering, supplied by Meursius, was printed in his edition of 1611 and afterwards reprinted without alteration in the edition of 1617 : it appeared side by side with the Greek text. It was. reprinted by Lami in his collected works of Meursius, as an appendix.50' The translation of Meursius was radically revised and amended by Anselm Banduri in his edition of 1711, and the revised version was. published in the Venice edition of 1729. Banduri’s rendering was also republished by Lami, side by side with the Greek text, in his collected works of Meursius. The same rendering was introduced, practically without alteration, by Bekker into his edition of 1840 and by Migne into the text of his Patrologia (1864). D. A. I. was translated into Russian by G. Laskin,51 and into Croat by N. Tomasié.52 Translations of select chapters or sections have been published in many works and in many languages. We may instance the following : _ several passages in Latin translation are to be found in Stritter’s col lection ;53 N. V. Malickij published a revised Russian translation of chh. 1—14, 38—40, 42—46 and 53, which was found in ms. among the papers i < of V. V. Latysev54; Russian renderings of other passages are found in the works of E. Kunik, N. Protopopov, A. Zernin, V. Jurgevic, K. Grot. F. I. Uspenskij, S. P. Sestakov, F .Westberg, N. P. Kondakov and others. K. Dieterich turned some chapters into German.55 German translations of select passages are found in the works of A. C. Lehrberg, E. Kunik, V.

A Hungarian version of the chh. dealing with the Hungarians may be found both in the editions of H. Marczali and in the special study of K. Szabó.
4. MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP OF MANUSCRIPTS AND EDITIONS
A full collation of the four mss. (P, V, F, M) and of the three editions (Me, Ba, Be) shows their mutual relationship to have been as follows: V is a simple transcript of P. This is clear from the following considerations : 1. V contains many orthographical errors, which are due to the peculiar and individual forms of letters employed by P, that is to say, they are due to palaeographical causes. Antony Eparchus imitated faithfully in many places the peculiarities and abbreviations in the script of P, but occasionally misread some of the letters and abbreviations, e. g.: 13183 TiEQiyívso'&ai P: negiijvEO'&ai V || 2963 Xgwßdxot P: Xgwpdxoi V || 30110 Bgdx^a P : BgdxCco V || 4288 XagdxovX P : XoogdxovX V |j 4387eyygaepov P : äyygacpov V || 43m Ka^xíov P: Ktxtov V || 43 169- n o a<> xgtvix(rjv) P : axQivlrrjv V 11 50199 ngoßXrj'&evxag P : ngoxXrpdévxag V |j 53425 eonevae(v) P : eneaev V 11 53429 XeXrj-ddxi P : Xepedóxt, V.
2. In other passages some letters of P are indistinct and were in consequence omitted by the copyist of V, e. g .: 13136 ngoasxgixpaxo P : ngoexgerpaxo V || 1416 ovvavaaxpecpó/iEvot; P : avvavaxgecpópevog V || 2514 pexdnepcp&Eh; P : fiexane/Mpelt; V.
3. Further, it is clear that in two places the copyist of V has written a passage twice over, just because the initial words of the dupli cated passages happen in P to recur at the beginning of a line. These dittographies are: 50126 Meaonoxapiiav — 50128 ftéfia iter. V. || 51198 fiayiaxgov — dvxog om. et d0' — xatjeidsveiv (cf. 51194_ 195) iter. V.
4. Basic corruptions of P recur in V. Common to both versions are : P19 avxwv om. P V || 14 <5elv om. P V || 221 öiaßißdocoaiv] diaßdawatv P V Ij 990 xatgoc,] xagög P V 11 1377 Oeov om.

Antony Eparchus incorporated into his version additions andi alterations made by later hands in P, among which is the note, already referred to, which bears the date 1361/2, e. g. : 168 post £ q% siglo •/•■ adhibito vvv dd (eoxiv) tgcoo' (ivbixxtcóvog) le', cog elvai and xdx(e) ecog vvvXqdvoi tpp mg. add.

6. In two passages of the text of P (2253, 2257: correction of the: word ’Aqdßoov) we recognise unmistakably the handwriting of Antony i Eparchus (= P4). These examples prove indisputably that the youthful Antony Eparchus copied V from P in 1509. For all that, V is not a faithful, verbal! transcript of P. The text of V as compared with P, shows many signi ficant variants, a large proportion of which has crept into the editions (Me, Ba, Be). It is unnecessary to detail all the errors of V ; some; examples are : 1. The copyist of V often omits words or phrases, e. g. : 915 xai áneQxovxai om. V (F Me) || 1349 ßaoiXdoog om.

2. The copyist of V read or transcribed some words incorrectly, e. g .: 969 cpfidteiv P: cpdávetv V (F Me Ba Be) || 2550 xqoxpűévxog P (Ba Be): xqaxpddvxog V (F Me) || 2787 Bqovvbov P (BaBe): Bqovbov V (F Me) || 3042 äqeo'ddvxeg P : éqaoddvxeg V (F Me Ba Be) || 3294 exovxag P (Be) : exovxeg V (F Me Ba) || 3864 nqd qpddvxeg P : nqoeiqppdvoi V (F Me Ba Be) || 407 Kdßaqot P (Ba Be) : Bdxaqoi V (F Me) || 4034 ZyevbonXóxog P (Ba Be) : ZcpevbovonXdxog V (F Me) j| 42106 ZnaxaXov P : noxapov V (F Me Ba Be) || 4326 éoxpnxexo P (Be) : éoxdnxexo V

The copyist of V sometimes replaced the numerical cyphers of P by the verbal equivalents, or conversely, rendered the numerals of P by numerical cyphers, e. g. : 936 a P : πρώτον V (F Me Ba Be) II 945 ό' P: τέταρτον V (F Me Ba Be) || 953 έξ P (Me Ba Be): ζ' V (F) (I 167 iß' P: δωδέκατον V (F M Me Ba Be) || 2316 β’ P: δεντέρας V (F Me Ba Be) || 2623 a P : πρώτον V (F Me Ba Be) || 29248 μιας P : a V (F Me Ba Be) || 3020 a P : χιλίων V (F Me Ba Be) || 466 γ P : τρεις V (F Me Ba Be) || 526 δύο P (Me Ba Be) : β' V F. 4. The copyist of V occasionally changed the word-order, e. g. : P40 αιώνιος καί άνώλεϋρος P : άνώλεΰρος καί αιώνιος V (F Me Ba Be) || 7,_2 περί τών από Χερσώνος άποστελλομένων βασιλικών Ρ : περί τών άποστελλομένων βασιλικών από Χερσώνος V (F Me Ba Be) || 9105_ 106 έξέρχωνται άρχον τες P : άρχοντες εξέρχονται V (F Me Ba Be) || 1350_ 51 διά τον αγγέλου ό Θ(εό)ς Ρ : ό Θ(εό)ς διά τον αγγέλου V (F Me Ba Be) || 178 έσϋίοντα από καμηλού Ρ (Μ) : από καμηλού έσϋίοντα V (F Me Ba Be) || 29258 νησίον έστίν μικρό(ν) Ρ : μικρόν έστι νησίον V (F Me Ba Be) || 3292 εν τούτο γενόμενος Ρ : γενόμενος εν τούτω V (F Me Ba Be) || 4642 έστιν οχυρόν πάνυ Ρ : οχυρόν έστι πάνυ V (F Me Ba Be) || 4950 ναόν αύτοϋ Ρ : αυτόν ναόν V (F Me Ba Be) || 50226 της αυτού Ρ : αυτού τής V (F Me Ba Be). 5. The copyist of V occasionally made stylistic changes, e. g. : 164_ 5 καί τις ό τά σκήπτρα τής βασιλείας 'Ρωμαίων διέπω(ν) Ρ (Μ) : καί τις ήν τότε ό βασιλ(εύς) rΡωμαί(ων) V (F Me Ba Be) || 2937_ 38 διαπερασάντων ποτέ τών rΡωμόνων · ποιήσαντες ούτοι ένκρύμματα Ρ (Ba Be) : διαπεράσαντες ποτέ οί 'Ρωμάνοι έποίησαν ούτοι έγκρυμα V (F Me) || 3860__61 παρά τών Πατζινακιτών ούκ έδέξαντο Ρ : μετά τών Πατζινακιτών ούκ έποίησαν V (F Me Ba Be) || 46110 βαλών αυτό εις κοντάριον Ρ : λαβών αυτό εις κοντάριον περιέΰηκε καί V (F Me Ba Be) || 5067 τού τελείν αυτούς Ρ : ινα τελώσι τά V (F Me Ba Be). 6. The copyist of V occasionally inserted words which are missing in P, e. g .: 948 post άπαντα add. τά μονόξυλα τά V (F) || 961 ante δεύτερον add. εις τον V (F Me Ba Be) || 9106 post Κίαβον add. ποταμόν V (F Me) || 18x post Αράβων add. αρχηγός V (F Me) |j 29203 ante μέλλοντος add. τού V (F) II 339 post βασιλέα add.

30 Critical Introduction
If we look more closely at the variants of V, we observe that they are only in part oversights or slips of the copyist, while others of them represent a deliberate attempt to emend the text. Antony Eparchus, like so many other humanists, was, it should seem, no slavish copyist, but showed some independence in his efforts to correct what he was copying. This is clear also from the fact that in many places he has emended not only misspellings in P, but also textual corruptions. Comparison of the mss. makes it clear that F is copied immediately from V. This is proved not only by the circumstance that at the end of the text of F we discover the same chronological note which, as we saw, Antony Eparchus appended to V in 1509, but also by the fact that all the omissions, repetitions and variants of V recur in F ; that is to say, where P and V disagree, F invariably follows V to the letter. The copyist of F was faithful to the text of V, but here and there introduced noteworthy corrections of his own. It is also beyond question that in his transcription into M of the section relating to the Saracens, Andrea Darmari copied from P. This is proved indisputably by the fact that where P and V disagree, M always agrees with P, and further that Darmari introduced into his text cor rections and additions made by later hands in P. Numerous errors distort his te x t; and in two places the copyist has incorporated marginal notes from P as though they were chapter-headings. As for the editions, Meursius, as he tells us himself, used V ; but comparison shows that in many places he has diverged from his orginal. These divergencies are in most cases blunders on the part of Meursius, and only in a few instances can be regarded as deliberate attempts at emendation. Some of his blunders Meursius himself corrected in the «Notae breves» and «Errata» appended to his edition, but most of them perpetuated themselves in the later editions, Ba and Be. Discrepancies between the text of Meursius and V are : 1. Meursius omitted many words and phrases, e. g. : 23 πρ άλλήλονς om. Me || 13198 καί έ&ών om. Me || 2191_ 92 Μανίον γέρων προς τον γέροντα τον om. Me || 263 τον om. Me (Ba) || 2612 έστέιμ&η παρά τον τότε πάπα. Και om. Me || 2779 κάστρον om.

Meursius misread or miscopied several words, and his edition has also typographical errors, e. g. : 121 ϋεοφνλάκτω (P) V (F Be) : ϋενφυλάκτη Me (Ba) || 910 αί λοιπαί Σκλαβινίαι (P) V (F): οί λοιποί Σκλαβίνιοι Me (Ba Be) || 1717 άποκτενόμενος (P) V (F) : άποκτεινόμένος (Μ) Me (Ba Be) || 2730 Λαγούβαρδοι (P) V (F) : Λογονβάρδοι Me (Ba Be) || 3722 Κονρκονται (P) V (F) : Κονρκονταν Me (Ba Be) || 405 Κονρτουγερμάτου (P) V (F) : Κονρτυγερμάτον Me (Ba Be) || 4370 διατρίψας (P) V (F Be) : έπιτρίψας Me (Ba) || 43110 άνεβλάστησεν (P) V (F) : έβλάστησε Me (Ba Be) || 4973 το τί (P) V (F Ba Be) : τότε Me || 505 τοϋ παρ'" αυτών τελούμενου πάκτον (P) V (F ): τών παρ’ αυτών τελουμένων πάκτων Me (Ba Be) II 53113 ήμεϊς (P) V (F Ba Be) : ονδείς Me || 53357 έκλεξάσϋωσαν (Ρ) V (F) : έκλεξάτωσαν Me (Ba Be) || 53428 ένεχϋήναι (P) V (F Be) : ήνεχ&ήναι Me (Ba).
3. Meursius in most cases replaced the numerical cyphers of V by the verbal equivalents e. g. : 957 ε (P) V (F ): πέμπτον Me (Ba Be) II 185 y (P) V (F Μ) : τρία Me (Ba Be) || 2998 ρ' (P) V (F): εκατόν Me (Ba Be) || 29265 ιε (Ρ) V (F ): δεκαπέντε Me (Ba Be) || 305O a (Ρ) V (F ): χιλίων Me (Ba Be) || 3733 μ (Ρ) V (F) : τεσσαράκοντα Me (Ba Be) || 4038 a (Ρ) V : πρώτος (F) Me (Ba Be) |] 4939 y (Ρ) V (F) : τρίτη Me (Ba Be) || 5121 β' (Ρ) V (F) : δεύτερον Me (Ba Be) || 53295 i rj iß' (P) V (F): δέκα ή δώδεκα Me (Ba Be). 4. Meursius made occasional changes in word-order, e. g. : 2720 άποσταλήναι μοι (Ρ) V (F) : μοι άποσταλήναι Me (Ba Be) || 29211 σφαγής αυτόν (Ρ) V (F) : αυτόν σφαγής Me (Ba Be) || 29286 εκεϊσε κλάδωνα (Ρ) V (F) : κλάδωνα εκεϊσε Me (Ba Be) || 32136 τών 'Ρωμαίων βασιλεύς (Ρ) V (F ): βασιλεύς 'Ρωμαίων Me (Ba Be) || 4051 κύρια ονόματα (Ρ) V (F ): ονό ματα κύρια Me (Ba Be) || 45141 γενέσδαι δούλος (Ρ) V (F) : δούλος γενέσϋαι Me (Ba Be) || 50130_ 131 τών 'Ρωμαίων εξουσίαν (Ρ) V (F ): εξουσίαν τών 'Ρωμαίων Me (Ba Be) || 51125 βασιλικόν δρομώνων (Ρ) V (F) : δρομώ νων βασιλικόν Me (Ba Be) || 53369 πληροφορήσαι εν δρκω (Ρ) V (F) : έν δρκω πληροφορήσαι Me (Ba Be).
5. Meursius here and there inserts words missing in V, and hence in P also, e. g. : 94 ante 'Ρωσίας add. τής Me (Ba Be) || 963 post τούτον add. καί Me |j 2229 ante Ιουστινιανόν add. τον Me (Ba Be) || 2264 ante την1 add. διά Me || 253 post Βρεττανίαν add. αλλά Me || 2528 post εσπερών add.

If we take into consideration that the ms. V used by Meursiu: contains, as we have shown, innumerable errors, we can scarcely wonde that the first edition presents a sufficiently corrupted version of th« original. It should, however, be emphasized that Meursius, particularly in his notes, made a large number of emendations to the text, and o· these emendations later editions have made use. The edition of Banduri marks an advance on that of Meursius Banduri, as he himself records, collated Meursius’ text with P and was thus able to correct, both in his text and in his notes, large number of errors originating partly in V and partly in Me. Bui Banduri did not make his collation with the necessary care, with th result that many omissions and blunders escaped his attention. Ηοΐ many errors of Meursius were corrected by Banduri, and how man t Banduri transferred to his own edition, may be easily discerned if w look at the examples given above in our examination of the relationshi of V and Me, and note the proportion of the number of errors found i V Me and Me only to the number of errors found in V Me Ba or V M Ba Be, and in Me Ba or Me Ba Be. To the number of inherite J, blunders Banduri added a fresh crop of his own, e. g. : 63 πέπερι B (Be) II 2961 έξ om. Ba || 2982 ερμηνεύονται Ba (Be) || 30n oi λοιποί Σκλο βίνιοι Ba (Be) || 4012 Λιούντινα Ba (Be) || 4521 καί1 οηι. Ba (Be) || 46r Κωνσταντίνον (per comp.

Ba (Bt II 53231 άρχομενον Ba (Be) || 53455 τής1] τήν Ba (Be). Bekker’s edition marks no considerable advance. He made r: study of mss., and therefore made no use of fresh ms. material. Hi republished Banduri’s text, which he occasionally emended by his ow conjectures. Although he recorded in his critical apparatus the varian between the mss. used by Meursius and Banduri, and between the. respective editions, yet he merely copied this information out of Bar duri’s notes, as is seen from the fact that he reproduces Banduri’s typ> graphical errors. Bekker’s edition therefore repeats numerous errors earlier editions, as appears in our examination above of the relationsh between V Me and Ba ; and he added to their number the slips ar typographical errors of his own edition, e. g. : 2142 κροβάλλονται || 26

In the light of our examination of the mutual relationship of mss. and editions, we may summarize as follows the history of the text of D. A. I.
Of D. A. /., as of the De Cerimoniis, only one ms. survives from the Byzantine age. In view of the fact that none of the later Byzantine historians or chronographers makes use of the work, we must conclude that D. A. /., which was a confidential, indeed a most secret, document, was never published, but only preserved at the imperial court. There, probably, it was discovered by a member of the imperial family, the Caesar John Ducas, who between 1059 and 1081 had it copied for his library. But P is not an immediate copy of the original. Since P exhibits so many corruptions, and one marginal note refers to the year 979, we must postulate, between the archetype and P, yet another copy, probably made towards the close of the X century after the death of the author. Marginal notes and emendations make it clear that P continued to be read during the Byzantine age ; from the note of 1361/2 and from other corrections we may conclude that the chh. on the Saracens were of peculiar interest at the period when the Ottoman Turks had crossed the Hellespont (1360) and were threatening the capital. After this the history of P is obscure. We do not know where it went from the library of John Ducas or what was its fate, until it came into the hands of Antony Eparchus. Certain it is that during the Renaissance the interest of Venetian humanists was aroused by the chh. of the work dealing with Venice, as is clear from the marginal notes to V ; and that it is owing to this circumstance, not merely that the copy from the library of the Byzantine Caesar reached Italy, but also that, at the beginning of the XVI century, two other complete copies of the work were made there as well. Upon the copy of Antony Eparchus was based the first edition of Meursius, the errors of which Banduri endea voured to correct by a collation with the Byzantine copy ; but even so, many inherited errors were transmitted not only to his own edition but also to the final edition of Bekker, published more than a century ago. The relationships of mss. and editions may be seen at a glance in the following tree :

5. METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE PRESENT EDITION
It will be clear from our examination of the relationship of ms and editions that all the known mss. of D. A. I. derive from a Byzantin copy of the XI century, P, which is thus the source of the whole textus



Method of the Edition 35
tradition. On this ms. therefore, a new edition must be based.58 However, as we have emphasized, P exhibits additions, erasures and emendations which are partly the work of the copyist or a contemporary, and partly of various later hands. These last are again divisible into two categories : into those which were added to P before V and M were copied, and those which were added after V and M were copied. Insertions of the former class, which go back to the Byzantine age, are of unequal value : we find among them alterations which are mere arbitrary additions of later readers, such as the marginal note of 1361/2 ; but there are others, especially in the chh. dealing with the Arabs, which do emend errors which have occurred in the copying of P. Additions of the second category, dating from the post-Byzantine period and consisting of arbitrary alterations made by later readers, are of no value whatever ; a characteristic specimen of these is the garbling from analogy of the original name 'Almoutzis’ (see 3844, 3849). But, apart from the attentions of later hands, P has also, as we saw, sustained material damage ; and to restore the occasionally faded or mutilated text we are compelled to have recourse to the copies of P, made when P was in better condition than it is to-day. For these reasons, then, to restore the original text of P, use must be made of its copies, V and M. But even if the text of the Byzantine version preserved to us be purged of its later alterations and be restored, so far as may be, to its original state, the question remains whether P, thus restored, can be regarded as a faithful replica of the original text of Constantine. Since our new edition rests upon one ms. only, which cannot be checked by comparison with any other, the problem thus raised can be solved only by reference to internal evidence, that is, to the condition of the text as preserved in P and to the linguistic peculiarities of the work. There can be no doubt that copyist’s errors have crept even into P. It can be demonstrated that in some passages the copyist has omitted words, as is seen in cases where the text is mutilated or unintelligible (e. g. 14, 919, 1377, 2261, 2671, 4695). It is also certain that, in other passages, we have to deal with more serious corruptions (e. g. 13177, 2960, 29229, 3833, 4223, 53101), which can only be conjecturally emended. In correcting the text of P, we have to take into account the fact that. D. A. I. is compiled from various sources of which the language is not uniform. In some chapters we find vulgarisms whose removal

36 Critical Introduction
would distort the genuine form of the work.57 But since, as we sawabove, the orthography of P is extremely faulty, there are many places, where it is not easy to determine which linguistic peculiarities are native: to Constantine’s text and which are to be put down to the copyist. So,, for example, we see in P forms which indicate the amalgamation of the participles of olda and eldov (e. g. 45140, 4928, 4934, 53193, 53419, 5342s)' a phenomenon exemplified also in papyri and other demotic texts.58' Again, as is well known, in later Greek certain forms of indicative and subjunctive coincide in pronunciation ; and since P often confuses thediphthong et with the vowel r\, these forms coincide and amalgamate: in its text also. It is well known, too, that in the post-classical age the* i conjunction Iva is followed by indicative as well as subjunctive ; andi n since the orthography of P is not consistent, we sometimes find after Iva indicative and subjunctive forms used alternately even in the same; sentence (e. g. 1381_83, 53516). All these and other confusions in the orthography of P (e. g. absence of the temporal augment) often make it; hard to determine when we have, or have not, the right to correct it Again, it is common knowledge that Constantine drew one < part of his material from written sources which have come down to us independently. Such sources are, apart from citations of Holy Scripture the Chronicles of Theophanes and George Monachus, the Ethnica of Stephanus of Byzantium, the Acts of the Synod in Trullo, etc. Elsewhere passages of D. A. I. agree so closely with parallel passages of the De Thematibus, attributed to the same imperial author, and of the work ic known as Theophanes Continuatus, that for these passages we musli postulate a common source. Some passages, then, of D. A. I. have com* down to us immediately, and do not depend on P. We can thus compart the text of P with the text of the sources of the work, which sources may be used to restore the text of D. A. 1. A comparison of the text of P with that of the sources and of othe ni parallel passages shows that the author sometimes followed his original faithfully, but at other times modified their styles, and occasionally supplemented his sources with others of unknown origin. But for on appraisal of the text of Constantine it is of great importance te realize that the text of D. A. I. preserved to us, when compared wit! the text of its sources, gives evidence in several places of serious cor

ruption. At first sight we might conclude that P is a faulty copy, and that these errors must be corrected from the sources. But this is not so. A more searching examination shows that these supposed corruptions were to be found already in some mss. of the sources themselves (e. g. 2530, 4249). It follows that, as Constantine or his collaborators copied the sources they used out of mss. which were themselves corrupt, it is incorrect to attribute these corruptions to the carelessness of the copyist of P or other copyists of D. A. I . ; we must, on the contrary, suppose that these very corruptions stood even in the original ms. of Constantine. Recognition of this fact, and of its bearing on the restoration of the original form of D. A. /., enjoins upon us the preservation of these cor ruptions in our te x t; since, if we emend P, we shall be disturbing the true text as Constantine wrote it. Of course, in the many cases where direct evidence is lacking, it is very hard to pronounce whether a corrup tion is of pre- or post-Constantinian origin, that is to say, whether it has been introduced by the copyist or existed already in the mss. of the sources and was thence transferred to the original ms. of Constantine. In this difficulty we derive some assistance from the fact that, consider ing the corruptions from the point of view of their nature and quantity, we note a great difference between those sections of D. A. /. which are based on contemporary information and those which the editor has derived from older, written sources. In the former sections we find fewer errors, mainly of a minor character ; but in the latter, which had been subject to continual transcription over a period of a century or more, the corruptions are proportionately greater in numbers and importance. This principle cannot be used as an absolute criterion ; we have in each case, according to the nature of the corruption, to judge whether the corruption in question is or is not anterior to the age of Constantine, and whether in consequence we may or may not retain it in his text. In view of these facts, the principles applied to the new edition may thus be summarized : The new edition is based on P, the text of which, however, in places where it is disturbed by material damage, erasures or alterations by later hands, is restored by reference to V and M. The critical text diverges from P when the text of P appears to be corrupt, that is to say, in places where it may be supposed that, owing to copyists’ errors or alterations by later hands, the text of P does not correspond to the original text of Constantine’s work. In such places we have taken into account the variants of the later transcripts (V, F, M) and editions



38 Critical Introduction
(Me, Ba, Be) and the conjectural emendations of later researchers; anc: on the basis of these we have emended the text of P. Besides, the critical text diverges from P in spelling also. Moderr spelling has been adopted, which has involved the tacit correction o errors arising from itacism, of accentual errors (including the Byzantino system of enclitic accentuation) and of other irregularities. This has J been done the more readily since in our description of P above we have pointed out its orthographical peculiarities. We have kept the forms: of the codex for the ephelcusticon and for elision, although P is no i consistent in their use. As regards numbers in the text, P uses verba forms and cyphers indifferently, sometimes in the same sentence we have substituted verbal forms for cyphers in the text only when consistency absolutely demanded it. The apparatus criticus falls into two parts, and contains 1. references to sources and parallel passages (F)\ 2. variants of mss. and editions, and emendations and conjecture i of scholars (V). In the first section we have directed attention not merely to th immediate sources of Constantine but also to other, parallel passage which may assist the understanding of passages to which they ar referred. But we have restricted ourselves to Greek sources only, becaus the enumeration of all parallels in the different Western and Easteri sources would have made the apparatus too bulky. In cases wher» n there is no question of borrowing, but only of a common source, of simila sources of information, or simply of fortuitous concord, we cite th» works in question with the symbol «cf.». In the second section, the following principles have been adopted In each case where, for reasons already set forth, we diverge from th text of P, or where traces of emendations or erasures appear in the tex of P, the fact is noted positively; i. e. we indicate the origin of the variani adopted in the text, and the reading of P, and if necessary, the reading! of the later transcripts V, F, M, and of the editions Me, Ba, Be. I t all other cases, that is, where the form adopted in the text differs onl; in spelling from the form found in P, or when noteworthy variants ar recorded in later transcripts or editions, we note negatively, that ie we confine ourselves to a reference to the variants in the transcript or editions in question. In its references to P, the apparatus records not only the correction of the copyist himself (P1), but also the alterations and the margins notes made by different later hands (P2—P9). By the symbol Px ar



Method of the Edition 39
noted the alterations or erasures which were made by an unrecogniz able hand before V was copied, and by the symbol Py are noted the alterations or erasures which were made by another unrecognizable hand after V was copied. We have left unnoted erasures or alterations which are of a purely orthographical character, or those which occur in words whose meaning is obvious, though we note all erasures and alterations met with in uncommon proper names. Unnoted also are traces of occasional attempts by later hands to amend faded writing, unless such traces suggest that the text has been altered. Orthographical irregularities of P are noted in the apparatus onty when they occur in uncommon proper names, words of foreign deriva tion, colloquial words, or where the handwriting of P admits of more than one reading; and lastly where the accent falls on a syllable other than that which generally carries it. Abbreviations of P are noted only where their interpretation is doubtful, or when numerals are denoted by letters. Variants found in V, an immediate transcript of P, are noted in the apparatus only in cases where the parallel passages of P have suffered from material damage, erasures or alterations by later hands, or where V gives a variant which differs from the variant of P and which may serve to elucidate or emend the text. Variants found in F, a transcript of V, are noted only in exceptional cases, i. e. when F supplies some emendation of substance, or where the parallel passages of both V and P show traces of alteration. Variants found in M, a transcript of P, are noted only when erasure or alteration is found in the parallel passage of P. We regard it as unnecessary to note in the apparatus all the omis sions, all the blunders and all the alterations of later transcripts and editions, especially as in our description of mss. and editions we have already given several examples. The apparatus, therefore, notes only the variants which are informative from the point of view of the restoration or history of the text (including the discrepancies between our new text and the text of Be). Note that where reference is made to the text of the editions, the abbreviations noted above (Me, Ba, Be) are employed ; but where we refer to emendations or conjectures in the notes or appara tus of the editions, we cite them under the names of the respective editors (Meursius, Banduri, Bekker). If a source copied word for word by Constantine has come down to us independently, our apparatus notes variations therefrom, but not omissions and arbitrary alterations made by Constantine, who often modified the wording of his sources. Where, however, the author



40 Critical Introduction
has inserted anything into the text of his source, this is noted ii the apparatus. In respect to these sources, it has been found necessary in twi cases to examine their mss., and make use of the results of the nev collation. The relevant passages of the edition of Theophanes Continuatu I have collated with V (— codex Vaticanus gr. 167), and of De Thematv bus with G (= codex Parisinus gr. 854); the variants are noted in th apparatus. Special treatment had to be applied to the text of Georg' Monachus ; for, as G. de Boor has shown, the emperor Constantine mad' use of that variant of his text which is represented by codex P (= codl Coislin. gr. 305). We have therefore considered in the apparatu those variants especially which occur in this codex of George Monachus In the apparatus ms. variants are noted in all cases in the original spelling, omitting only the horizontal strokes above proper names an* the dots over the t and v. Variant proper names are given an initia capital. Uncial numerical signs are replaced by the usual miniscule forms and the horizontal stroke above them by the acute stroke universal! employed to-day. Signs and technical details of the apparatus of ou edition are generally in conformity with the ruling of the Internationa Union of Academies.59 Lastly, we have included in the apparatus all emendation and conjectures of scholars which are known to us, though they ar not all of equal value.60 This course is justified by the fact tha the bibliography relating to D. A. I. is so rich and extensive that man* individual conjectures are extraordinarily difficult to find. The worfl has in the past attracted so many different scholars, and their studio are published in so many different languages, that it is practically irn possible for one who is not a specialist to know them all.61 We hop

CONSTANTINE
IN CHRIST THE ETERNAL EMPEROR EMPEROR OF THE ROMANS
TO HIS SON ROMANUS
THE EMPEROR CROWNED OF GOD AND BORN IN THE PURPLE
Proem
A wise son maketh glad a father, and an affectionate father taketh delight in a prudent son. For the Lord giveth wit to speak in season, and addeth thereto an ear to hear; with Him is the treasure of wisdom, and from him cometh every perfect gift; He setteth kings upon the throne and giveth unto them the lordship over all. Now therefore hearken unto me, my son, and being adept in this my teaching thou shalt be wise among the prudent, and be accounted prudent among the wise ; the peoples shall bless thee, and the multitudes of the nations shall call thee blessed. Be instructed in what it behoves thee before all else to know, and lay hold skilfully upon the helm of the rule. Study the things that are now, and be instructed concerning the things that are to be, so that thou mayst amass experience with sound judgment, and thou shalt be most competent in thine affairs. Lo, 1 set a doctrine before thee, so that being sharpened thereby in experi ence and knowledge, thou shalt not stumble concerning the best counsels and the common good: first, in what each nation has power to advantage the Romans, and in what to hurt, and how and by what other nation each severally may be encountered in arms and subdued ; then, concerning their ravenous and insatiate temper and the gifts they demand inordinately; next, concerning also the difference between other nations, their origins

These things have I discovered of my own wisdom, and have decreed that they shall be made known unto thee, my beloved son, in order that thou mayst know the difference between each of these nations, and how either to treat with and conciliate them, or to make war upon and oppose. For so shall they quake before thee as one mighty in wisdom, and as from fire shall they flee from thee ; their lips shall be bridled, and as darts shall thy words wound them unto death. Thou shalt appear terrible unto them, and at thy face shall trembling take hold upon them. And the Almighty shall cover thee with his shield, and thy Creator shall endue thee with under standing ; He shall direct thy steps, and shall establish thee upon a sure foundation. Thy throne shall be as the sun before Him, and His eyes shall be looking towards thee, and naught of harm shall touch thee, for He hath chosen thee and set thee apart from thy mother’s womb, and hath given unto thee His rule as unto one excellent above all men, and hath set thee as a refuge upon a h 11 and as a statue of gold upon an high place, and as a city upon a mountain hath He raised thee up, that the nations may bring to thee their gifts and thou mayst be adored of them that dwell upon the earth. But Thou, 0 Lord my God, whose rule abideth unharmed for ever, prosper him in his ways who through Thee was begotten of me, and may the visitation of Thy face be toward him, and Thine ear be inclined to his supplications. May Thy hand cover him, and may he rule because of truth, and may Thy right hand guide him ; may his ways be directed before Thee to keep thy statutes. May foes fall before his face, and his enemies lick the dust. May the stem of his race be shady with leaves of many offspring, and the shadow of his fruit cover the kingly mountains; for by Thee do kings rule, glorifying Thee for ever and ever.

Hear now, my son, those things of which I think you should not be ignorant, and be wise that you may attain to government. For I maintain that while learning is a good thing for all the rest as well, who are subjects, yet it is especially so for you, who are bound to take thought for the safety of all, and to steer and guide the laden ship of the world. And if in setting out my subject I have followed the plain and beaten track of speech and, so to say, idly running and simple prose, do not wonder at that, my son. For I have not been studious to make a display of fine writing or of an Atticizing style, swollen with the sublime and lofty, but rather have been eager by means of every-day and conversational narrative to teach you those things of which I think you should not be ignorant, and which may without difficulty provide that intelligence and prudence which are the fruit of long experience. I conceive, then, that it is always greatly to the advantage of the emperor of the Romans to be minded to keep the peace with the nation of the Pechenegs and to conclude conventions and treaties of friendship with them and to send every year to them from our side a diplomatic agent with presents befitting and suitable to that nation, and to take from their side sureties, that is, hostages and a diplomatic agent, who shall come, together with the competent minister, to this city protected of God, and shall enjoy all imperial benefits and gifts suitable for the emperor to bestow. This nation of the Pechenegs is neighbour to the district of Cherson, and if they are not friendly disposed towards us, they may make excursions and plundering raids against Cherson, and may ravage Cherson itself and the so-called Regions.

The Pechenegs are neighbours to and march with the Russians also, and often, when the two are not at peace with one another, raid Russia, and do her considerable harm and outrage. The Russians also are much concerned to keep the peace with the

Pechenegs. For they buy of them horned cattle and horses and sheep, whereby they live more easily and comfortably, since none of the aforesaid animals is found in Russia. Moreover, the Russians are quite unable to set out for wars beyond their borders unless they are at peace with the Pechenegs, because while they are away from their homes, these may come upon them and destroy and outrage their property. And so the Russians, both to avoid being harmed by them and beca se of the strength of that nation, are the more concerned always to be in alliance with them and to have them for support, so as both to be rid of their enmity and to enjoy the advantage of their assistance. Nor can the Russians come at this imperial city of the Romans, either for war or for trade, unless they are at peace with the Pechenegs, because when the Russians come with their ships to the barrages of the river and cannot pass through unless they lift their ships off the river and carry them past by porting them on their shoulders, then the men of this nation of the Pechenegs set upon them, and, as they cannot do two things at once, they are easily routed and cut to pieces.

The tribe of the Turks, too, trembles greatly at and fears the said Pechenegs, because they have often been defeated by them and brought to the verge of complete annihilation. Therefore the Turks always look on the Pechenegs with dread, and are held in check by them.

So long as the emperor of the Romans is at peace with the Pechenegs, neither Russians nor Turks can come upon the Roman dominions by force of arms, nor can they exact from the Romans large and inflated sums in money and goods as the price of peace, for they fear the strength of this nation which the emperor can turn against them while they are campaigning Iagainst the Romans. For the Pechenegs, if they are leagued in friendship with the emperor and won over by him through letters and gifts, can easily

To the Bulgarians also the emperor of the Romans will appear more formidable, and can impose on them the need for tranquillity, if he is at peace with the Pechenegs, because the said Pechenegs are neighbours to these Bulgarians also, and when they wish, either for private gain or to do a favour to the emperor of the Romans, they can easily march against Bulgaria, and with their preponderating multitude and their strength overwhelm and defeat them. And so the Bulgarians also continually struggle and strive to maintain peace and harmony with the Pechenegs. For from having frequently been crushingly defeated and plundered by them, they have learned by experience the value and advantage of being always at peace with them.

Yet another folk of these Pechenegs lies over against the district of Cherson ; they trade with the Ghersonites, and perform services for them and for the emperor in Russia and Ghazaria and Zichia and all the parts 5 beyond : that is to say, they receive from the Ghersonites a prearranged remuneration in respect of this service proportionate to their labour and trouble, in the form of pieces of purple cloth, ribbons, silks, gold brocade, pepper, scarlet or «Parthian» leather, and other commodities which they require, according to a contract which each Chersonite may make or agree 0 to with an individual Pecheneg. For these Pechenegs are free men and, soto say, independent, and never perform any service without remuneration.

Now these Pechenegs, who are ravenous and keenly covetous of articles rare among them , are shameless in their dem ands for generous gifts, the hostages dem anding this for themselves and th a t for their wives, and the escort som ething for th e ir owi> trouble and some m ore for th e w ear and te a r of their cattle. Then, when the imperial agent enters their country, they first ask for th e em peror’s gifts, and th e n again, when these have g lu tted th e menfolk, th ey ask for th e presents for their wives and parents. Also, all who come with him to escort him on his way back to Cherson dem and paym ent from him for their trouble and the wear and tear of their cattle.

The single-straked ships which come down from outer Russia to Constantinople are from Novgorod, where Sviatoslav, son of Igor, prince of Russia, had his seat, and others from the city of Smolensk and from Teliutza and Chernigov and from Busegrad. All these come down the river Dnieper, and are collected together at the city of Kiev, also called Sam batas. Their Slav tributaries, the so-called Krivichians and the Lenzanines and the rest of the Slavonic regions, cut the single-strakers on their m ountains in tim e of winter, and when they have fastened them together, as spring approaches, and the ice m elts, they bring them on to the neighbouring lakes. And since these lakes debouch into the river Dnieper, they enter

thence on to this same river, and come down to Kiev, and draw the ships along to be fitted out, and sell them to the Russians. The Russians buy these bottom s only, furnishing them with oars and rowlocks and other tackle from th e ir old single-strakers, which th ey dism antle ; and so th e y fit them out. And in the m onth of June they move off down the river Dnieper and come to V itichev, w hich is a trib u ta ry city of th e Russians, and th ere they gather during two or three days ; and when all the single-strakers are col lected together, then they set out, and come down the said Dnieper river. And first they come to the first barrage, called Essoupi, which means in R ussian and Slavonic 'D o not sleep !’ ; th e barrage itself is as narrow as the w idth of the Polo-ground ·, in th e m iddle of it are rooted high rocks, which stand out like islands. Against these, then, comes the w ater and wells up and dashes down over the other side, w ith a m ighty and terrific din. Therefore the Russians do not venture to pass between them , b u t put in to th e bank hard by, disem barking the men o n to dry land b u t leaving the rest of the goods on board the single-strakers ; they then strip and, feeling w ith th e ir feet to avoid striking on a rock, * * *. This th ey do, some at the prow, some amidships, while others again, in the stern, punt with poles ; and with all this careful procedure they pass this first barrage, edging round under the river-bank. When they have passed this barrage, they re-em bark the others from the dry land and sail away, and come down to the second barrage, called in Russian Oulvorsi, and in Slavonic Ostrovounip rach , which m eans 'th e Island of th e B arrage’. T his one is like th e first, awkward and not to be passed through. Once again they disembark the men and convey the single-strakers past, as on the first occasion. Similarly they pass the third barrage also, called Gelandri, which means in Slavonic 'N oise of the B arrage’, and th en th e fourth barrage, th e big one, called in Russian Aeifor, and in Slavonic Neasit, because the pelicans nest in the stones of the barrage.

those who are deputed to keep the watch with them get out, and off they go, these men, and keep vigilant watch for the Pechenegs. The remainder, taking up the goods which they have on board the single-strakers, conduct the slaves in their chains past by land, six miles, until they are through the barrage. Then, partly dragging their single-strakers, partly porting them on their shoulders, they convey them to the far side of the barrage; and then, putting them on the river and loading up their baggage, they embark themselves, and again sail off in them. When they come to the fifth barrage, called in Russian Varouforos, and in Slavonic Voulniprach, because it forms a large lake, they again convey their single-strakers through at the edges of the river, as at the first and second barrages, and arrive at the sixth barrage, called in Russian Leanti, and in Slavonic Veroutzi, that is 'the Boiling of the Water’, and this too they pass similarly. And thence they sail away to the seventh barrage, called in Russian Stroukoun, and in Sla vonic Naprezi, which means 'Little Barrage’. This they pass at the so-called ford of Krarion, where the Ghersonites cross over from Russia and the Pe chenegs to Cherson ; which ford is as wide as the Hippodrome, and is as high from below up to where the friends of the Pechenegs survey the scene as an arrow might reach of one shooting from bottom to top. It is at this point, therefore, that the Pechenegs come down and attack the Russians. After traversing this place, they reach the island called St. Gregory, on which island they perform their sacrifices because a gigantic oak-tree stands there ; and they sacrifice live cocks. Arrows, too, they peg in round about, and others bread and meat, or something of whatever each may have, as is their custom. They also throw lots regarding the cocks, whether to slaughter them, or to eat them as well, or to leave them alive. From this island on wards the Russians do not fear the Pecheneg until they reach the river Selinas. So then they start off thence and sail for four days, until they reach the lake which forms the mouth of the river, on which is the island of St. Aitherios. Arrived at this island, they rest themselves there for two or three days. And they re-equip their single-strakers with such tackle as is needed, sails and masts and rudders, which they bring with them. Since this lake

9. 10 is the mouth of this river, as has been said, and carries on down to the sea, and the island of St. Aitherios lies on the sea, they come thence to the Dniester river, and having got safely there they rest again. But when the weather is propitious, they put to sea and come to the river called Aspros, and after resting there too in like manner, they again set out and come to the Selinas, to the so-called branch of the Danube river. And until they are past the river Selinas, the Pechenegs keep pace with them. And if it happens that the sea casts a single-straker on shore, they all put in to land, in order to present a united opposition to the Pechenegs. But after the Selinas they fear nobody, but, entering the territory of Bulgaria, they come to the mouth of the Danube. From the Danube they proceed to the Konopas, and from the Konopas to Constantia, and from Constantia to the river of Varna, and from Varna they come to the river Ditzina, all of which are Bulgarian territory. From the Ditzina they reach the district of Mesembria, and there at last their voyage, fraught with such travail and terror, such difficulty and danger, is at an end. The severe manner of life of these same Russians in winter-time is as follows. When the month of November begins, their chiefs together with all the Russians at once leave Kiev and go off on the 'poliudie’, which means 'rounds’, that is, to the Slavonic regions of the Vervians and Drugovichians and Krivicbians and Severians and the rest of the Slavs who are tributaries of the Russians. There they are maintained throughout the winter, but then once more, starting from the month of April, when the ice of the Dnieper river melts, they come back to Kiev. They then pick up their single-strakers, as has been said above, and fit them out, and come down to Romania. The Uzes can attack the Pechenegs. I

Nine regions of Chazaria are adjacent to Alania, and the Alan can, if he be so minded, plunder these and so cause great damage and dearth among the Chazarä : for from these nine regions come all the livelihood and plenty of Chazaria.

If the ruler of Alania is not at peace with the Chazars, but thinks preferable the friendship of the emperor of the Romans, then, if the Chazars are not minded to preserve friendship and peace with the emperor, he, the Alan, may do them great hurt by ambushing their routes and setting upon them when they are off their guard, in their passage to Sarkéi and the Regions and Cherson. And if this ruler will act zealously to check them, then Cherson and the Regions may enjoy great and profound peace ; for the Chazars, afraid of the attack of the Alans and consequently not being free to attack Cherson and the Regions with an army, since they are not strong enough to fight both at once, will be compelled to remain at peace.

On the side of the mountains the Croats are adjacent to the Turks. The Pechenegs too can attack the Turks, and plunder and harm them greatly, as has been said above in the chapter on the Pechenegs.*5

Fix, my son, your minds’s eye upon my words, and learn those things which I command you, and you will be able in due season as from ancestral treasures to bring forth the wealth of wisdom, and to display the sap of a sharp wit. Know therefore that all the tribes of the north have, as it were implan ted in them by nature, a ravening greed of money, never satiated, and so they demand everything and hanker after everything and have desires that know no limit or circumscription, but are always eager for more, and desi rous to acquire great profits in exchange for a small service. And so these importunate demands and brazenly submitted claims must be turned back and rebutted by plausible speeches and prudent and clever excuses, which, in so far as our experience has enabled us to arrive at them, will, to speak summarily, run more or less as follows : Should they ever require and demand, whether they be Chazars, or Turks, or again Russians, or any other nation of the northerners and Scy thians, as frequently happens, that some of the imperial vesture or diadems or state robes should be sent to them in return for some service or office performed by them, then thus you shall excuse yourself : «These robes of state and the diadems, which you call rkamelaukia’, were not fashioned by men, nor by human arts devi ed or elaborated, but, as we find it written in secret stories of old history, when God made emperor that famous Con stantine the great, who was the first Christian emperor, He sent him these robes of state by the hand of His angel, and the diadems which you call 'kamelaukia’, and charged him to lay them in the great and holy church of God, which, after the name of that very wisdomwhich is the pro erty of God, is called St. Sophia ; and not to clothe himself in them every day, but only when it is a great public festival of the Lord. And so by God’s command he laid them up, and they hang above the holy table in the sanctuary of this same church, and are for the ornament of the church. And the rest of the imperial vestments and cloaks lie spread out upon this holy table. And when a festival of our Lord and God Jesus Christ comes round, the patriarch takes up such of these robes of state and diadems as are suitable and appro priated to that occasion, and sends them to the emperor, and he wears them in the procession, and only in it, as the servant and minister of God, and after use returns them again to the church, and they are laid up in it. Moreover, there is a curse of the holy and great emperor Constantine en

graved upon this holy table of the church of God, according as he was char ged by God through the angel, that if an emperor for any use or occasion or unseasonable desire be minded to take of them and either himself misuse them or give them to others, he shall be anathematized as the foe and enemy of the commands of God, and shall be excommunicated from the church ; moreover, if he himself be minded to make others like them, these too the church of God must take, with the freely expressed approval of all the archbishops and of the senate ; and it shall not be in the authority either of the emperor, or of the patriarch, or of any other, to take these robes of state or the diadems from the holy church of God. And mighty dread hangs over them who are minded to transgress any of these divine ordinances. For one of the emperors, Leo by name, who also married a wife from Chazaria, out of his folly and rashness took up one of these diadems when no festival of the Lord was toward, and without the approval of the patriarch put it about his head. And straightway a carbuncle came forth upon his forehead so that in torment at the pains of it he evilly departed his evil life, and ran upon death untimely. And, this rash act being summarily avenged, thereafter a rule was made, that when he is about to be crowned the emperor must first swear and give surety that he will neither do nor conceive anything against what has been ordained and kept from ancient times, and then may he be crowned by the patriarch and perform and execute the rites appro priate to the established festival.» Similar care and thought you shall take in the matter of the liquid fire which is discharged through tubes, so that if any shall ever venture to demand this too, as they have often made demands of us also, you may rebut and dismiss them in words like these: «This too was revealed and taught by God through an angel to the great and holy Constantine, the first Chri stian emperor, and concerning this too he received great charges from the same angel, as we are assured by the faithful witness of our fathers and grandfathers, that it should be manufactured among the Christians only and in the city ruled by them, and nowhere else at all, nor should it be sent nor taught to any other nation whatsoever. And so, for the confirmation of this among those who should come after him, this great emperor caused curses to be inscribed on the holy table of the church of God, that he who

should dare to give of this fire to another nation should neither be called a Christian, nor be held worthy of any rank or office ; and if he should be the holder of any such, he should be expelled therefrom and be anathema tized and made an example for ever and ever, whether he were emperor, or patriarch, or any other man whatever, either ruler or subject, who should seek to transgress this commandment. And he adjured all who had the zeal and fear of God to be prompt to make away with him who attempted to do this, as a common enemy and a transgressor of this great commandment, and to dismiss him to a death most hateful and cruel. And it happened once, as wickedness will still find room, that one of our military governors, wrho had been most heavily bribed by certain infidels, handed over some of this fire to them ; and, since God could not endure to leave unavenged this transgression, as he was about to enter the holy church of God, fire came down out of heaven and devoured and consumed him utterly. And thereafter mighty dread and terror were implanted in the hearts of all men, and never since then has anyone, whether emperor, or noble, or private citizen, or military governor, or any man of any sort whatever, ventured to think of such a thing, far less to attempt to do it or bring it to pass.» 'But come, now, turn’, and to meet another sort of demand, monstrous and unseemly, seemly and appropriate words discover and seek out. For if any of these shifty and dishonourable tribes of the north shall ever demand a marriage alliance with the emperor of the Romans, and either to take his daughter to wife, or to give a daughter of their own to be wife to the emperor or to the emperor’s son, this monstrous demand of theirs also you shall rebut with these words, saying: «Concerning this matter also a dread and authentic charge and ordinance of the great and holy Constantine is engraved upon the sacred table of the catholic church of the Christians, St. Sophia, that never shall an emperor of the Romans ally himself in marriage with a nation of customs differing from and alien to those of the Roman order, especially with one that is infidel and unbaptized, unless it be with the Franks alone ; for they alone were excepted by that great man, the holy Constantine, because he himself drew his origin from those parts ; for there is much relationship and converse between Franks and Romans. And why did he order that with them alone the emperors of the Romans should

intermarry? Because of the traditional fame of those lands and the nobility of those tribes. But with any other nation whatsoever it was not to be in their power to do this, and he who dared to do it was to be condemned as an alien from the ranks of the Christians and subject to the anthema, as a transgressor of ancestral laws and imperial ordinances. And that emperor Leo aforesaid, who also, as has been described above, unlawfully and rashly, without the consent of him who was then patriarch, took from the church the diadem and put it about his head and was summarily punished in full for his wicked attempt, dared to make light of and to disregard this com mandment also of that holy emperor, which, as has already been made clear, is engraved on the holy table ; and as he had once put himself outside the fear of God and His commandments, so also he contracted an alli ance in marriage with the chagan of Chazaria, and received his daughter to be his wife, and thereby attached great shame to the empire of the Romans and to himself, because he annulled and disregarded the ancestral injunc tions ; yet he, however, was not even an orthodox Christian, but an heretic and a destroyer of images. And so for these his unlawful impieties he is continually excommunicated and anthematized in the church of God, as a transgressor and perverter of the ordinance of God and of the holy and great emperor Constantine. For how can it be admissable that Christians should form marriage associations and ally themselves by marriage with infidels, when the canon forbids it and the whole church regards it as alien to and outside the Christian order? Or which of the illustrious or noble or wise emperors of the Romans has admitted it?» But if they reply : «How then did the lord Romanus, the emperor, ally himself in marriage with the Bulgarians, and give his grand-daughter to the lord Peter the Bulga rian?», this must be the defence : «The lord Romanus, the emperor, was a common, illiterate fellow, and not from among those who have been bred up in the palace, and have followed the Roman national customs from the beginning ; nor was he of imperial and noble stock, and for this reason in most of his actions he was too arrogant and despotic, and in this instance he neither heeded the prohibition of the church, nor followed the command ment and ordinance of the great Constantine, but out of a temper arrogant and self-willed and untaught in virtue and refusing to follow what was

right and good, or to submit to the ordinances handed down by our fore fathers, he dared to do this thing ; offering, that is, this alone by way of specious excuse, that by this action so many Christian prisoners were ran somed, and that the Bulgarians too are Christians and of like faith with us, and that in any case she who was given in marriage was not daughter of the monarch and lawful emperor, but of the third and most junior, who was still subordinate and had no share of authority in matters of govern ment ; but this was no different from giving any other of the ladies of the imperial family, whether more distantly or closely related to the imperial nobility, nor did it make any difference that she was given for some service to the commonweal, or was daughter of the most junior, who had no autho rity to speak of. And because he did this thing contrary to the canon and to ecclesiastical tradition and the ordinance and commandment of the great and holy emperor Constantine, the aforesaid lord Romanus was in his lifetime much abused, and was slandered and hated by the senatorial council and all the commons and the church herself, so that their hatred became abundantly clear in the end to which he came ; and after his death he is in the same way vilified and slandered and condemned inasmuch as he too introduced an unworthy and unseemly innovation into the noble polity of the Romans.» For each nation has different customs and divergent laws and institutions, and should consolidate those things that are proper to it, and should form and develop out of the same nation the associations for the fusion of its life. For just as each animal mates with its own tribe, so it is right that each nation also should marry and cohabit not with those of other race and tongue but of the same tribe and speech. For hence arise naturally harmony of thought and intercourse among one another and friendly converse and living together ; but alien customs and divergent laws are likely on the contrary to engender enmities and quarrels and hatreds and broils, which tend to beget not friendship and association but spite and division. Mark, too, that it is not for those who wish to govern lawfully to copy and emulate what has been ill done by some out of ignorance or arrogance, but rather to have the glorious deeds of those who have ruled lawfully and righteously as noble pictures set up for an example to be copied, and after their pattern to strive himself also to direct all that he does; since the end which came upon him, I mean, the lord Romanus, through these

The blasphemous and obscene Mahomet, whom the Saracens claim for their prophet, traces his genealogy by descent from the most widespread race of Ishmael, son of Abraham. For Nizaros, the descendant of Ishmael, is proclaimed the father of them all. Now he begat two sons, Moundaros and Rabias, and Moundaros begat Kousaros and Kaisos and Themimes and Asandos and various others whose names are unknown, who were allotted the Madianite desert and reared their flocks, dwelling in tents. And there are others further off in the interior who are not of the same tribe, but of Iektan, the so-called Homerites, that is, Amanites. And the story is published abroad thus. This Mahomet, being destitute and an orphan, thought fit to hire himself out to a certain wealthy woman, his relative, Chadiga by name, to tend her camels and to trade for her in Egypt among the foreigners and in Palestine. Thereafter by little and little he grew more free in converse and ingratiated himself with the woman, who was a widow, and took her to wife. Now, during his visits to Palestine and intercourse with Jews and Christians he used to follow up certain of their doctrines and interpretations of scripture. But as he had the disease of epilepsy, his wife, a noble and wealthy lady, was greatly cast down at being united to this man, who was not only destitute but an epileptic into the bargain, and so he deceived her by alleging : «I behold a dreadful vision of an angel called Gabriel, and

The woman being in this manner imposed on and proclaiming to other women of her tribe that he was a prophet, the lying fraud reached also the ears of a head-man whose name was Boubachar. Well, the woman died and left her husband behind to succeed her and to be heir of her estate, and he became a notable and very wealthy man, and his wicked imposture and heresy took hold on the district of Ethribos. And the crazy and deluded fellow taught those who believed on him, that he who slays an enemy or is slain by an enemy enters into paradise, and all the rest of his nonsense. And they pray, moreover, to the star of Aphro dite, which they call Koubar, and in their supplication cry o u t: «Alla wa Koubar», that is, 'God and Aphrodite’. For they call God 'Alla’, and 'wa’ they use for the conjunction 'and’, and they call the star 'Koubar’, and so they say 'Alla wa Koubar’.

Fatem was a daughter of Mahomet, and from her are begotten the Fatemites. They are not from Fatemi, from the country of Libya, but dwell in the district north of Mecca, away behind the tomb of Mahomet. They are an Arab nation, carefully trained to wars and battles ; for with the aid of this tribe Mahomet went to war, and took many cities and subdued many countries. For they are brave men and warriors, so that if they be found to the number of a thousand in an army, that army cannot be defeated or worsted. They ride not horses but camels, and in time of war they do not put on corselets or coats of mail but pink-coloured jerkins, and have long spears and shields as tall as a man and enormous wooden bows-which few can bend, and that with difficulty.

The Exodus of the Saracens took place on the third day of the month of September of the tenth indiction, in the twelfth year of Heraclius, in the year from the creation of the world 6130. And the horoscope of these same Saracens was cast in the month of September, on the third day of the month, the fifth day of the week. At this same time Mouameth was first chief of the Arabs, whom the Arabs call Mahomet, who was also their prophet, and he held rule over the Arabs nine years.

In this year, 6139, died Mouameth, chief and false prophet of the Saracens, having appointed in his room Aboubacharos, or Boupaktor, his kinsman. And the deluded Jews at his first appearance had taken him for the Christ whom they expect, so that some of their leading men approached him and received his religion and forsook that of Moses who beheld God. But when they saw him eating camel’s flesh, they realized that he was not what they had thought him. But they taught him to do nefarious crimes against the Christians and continued in his company. These are they who taught him to accept some parts of the Law, both the circumcision and other matters, which the Saracens observe. The first to come after him, then, was Aboubachar, who had proclaimed him to be a prophet and was for that reason left behind to succeed him. And his heresy prevailed in the district of Ethribos, at first in secret ten years, and at last through

And he taught his subjects that he who has slain an enemy or is slain by an enemy enters unhindered into paradise, and said that it is a paradise of carnal eating and drinking and lying with women, and that a river of wine and honey and milk flows down it and the women are incomparable to look upon, not such as we know here but other, and he fabled that intercourse with them is of long duration and the pleasure continuous, and other matters replete with lidertinism and folly ; and they are to forgive one another and aid one another when wronged.

This same Oumar marched against Palestine, and laid siege in it and blockaded Jerusalem for the space of two years, and took it by guile. For Sophronius, bishop of Jerusalem, one moved with divine zeal and excellent in sagacity, received from him a most sure undertaking concerning the churches throughout Palestine, so that the churches were neither de stroyed nor sacked. When Sophronius saw him, he said : «Of a truth this is the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, that standeth in the holy place.» He demanded the temple of the Jews that Solomon built, to make it the place of worship of his blasphemy. And it is so to this day.

He took Africa by war, and arranged imposts with the Africans and returned. His general was Mauias, who pulled down the colossus of Rhodes and took the island of Cyprus and all its cities. He took the island of Arados also and burnt its city, and made the island desolate to this day. When he came to the island of Rhodes, he demolished the colossus in it, one thous and 360 years after it had been set up, and a Jewish merchant of Edessa bought it and loaded 900 camels with the bronze of it. This Mauias also made an expedition against Constantinople and ravaged Ephesus and Halicarnassus and Smyrna and the rest of the cities of Ionia, and after the death of Outhman was fifth chief of the Arabs for twenty-four years.

At the end of the life of Mauias, chief of the Arabs, the Mardaites entered the Lebanon and took possession of it from the Black mountain to the holy city, and made themselves masters of the summits of the Lebanon; and many slaves and natives ran to them for refuge, in numbers which shortly amounted to many thousands. On learning this, Mauias was greatly alarmed, and his counsellors with him. And he sent envoys to the emperor Constantine, seeking for peace. Therefore, the emperor Constantine, the orthodox, son of Pogonatus, dispatched John surnamed Pitzikaudis. And when he arrived in Syria, Mauias received him with great honour, and it

was agreed on both sides that a convention of peace should be drawn up in writing and sworn to, on the basis of an agreed annual tribute, the Agarenes to pay to the emperor of the Romans three thousand pieces of gold and 800 prisoners and 50 thoroughbred horses. At this time the empire of the Arabs was divided in two parts. In Ethribos Ali held rule, but Mauias held Egypt and Palestine and Damascus. And the dwellers in Ethribos marched with the sons of Ali against Mauias. And Mauias armed himself against them and joined battle by the river Euphrates, and the party of Ali was defeated, and Mauias took Ethribos and all the land of Syria. And his family held rule 85 years. And after him came forth the so-called Black-robed out of Persia, who hold rule to this day, and they fought with the clan of Mauias and utterly destroyed it. And they slew Marouam also, who was its head. And few of the party of Mauias were left, and they, together with one grandson of Mauias, were pursued by the Black-robed as far as Africa. Now this same grandson of Mauias with a few followers crossed over into Spain in the days of Justinian Rhinotmetus, not of Pogonatus. But this has not been written by our historians. For from the time of the capture of great Rome by the Goths, the Roman possessions began to be lopped off, and none of thé historians has made mention of the region of Spain, nor of the clan of Mauias. But the history of Theophanes, of blessed memory, has the following account: And so Mauias, chief of the Saracens, died, who had been general 26 years, and had ruled as emir 24 years. And Izid, his son, held rule over the Arabs 6 years. On his death the Arabs of Ethribos were disturbed, and they arose and set up Abdelas, son of Zouber, to be their chief. When they heard this, the Arabs who dwelt in Phoenicia and Palestine and Damascus came to Ousas, the emir of Palestine, and appointed Marouam and set him up to be chief, and he held the rule 9 months. On his death, his son Abimelech succeeded to the rule and held it 22 years and 6 months. And

he overcame the rebels, and slew Abdelas, son and successor of Zouber. Meanwhile, the emperor Constantine, son of Pogonatus, died, having held rule over the Romans 17 years ; and his son Justinian reigned in his stead. The chief of the Arabs who was fifth after Mouameth to hold rule over the Arabs was not of the family of Mouameth, but of another tribe. And first he was appointed general and admiral by Outhman, chief of the Arabs, and was sent against the state of the Romans with a strong force and 1200 decked ships. He proceeded to Rhodes, and thence, after fitting out his expedition, came up to Constantinople, and lingered a long time, and laid waste the environs of Byzantium, but returned with his purpose unachieved. When he came to Rhodes, he pulled down the colossus that stood in it. It was a brazen statue of the sun, gilded from head to foot, 80 cubits in height and broad in proportion, as witness the inscription written on the base of its feet, running like this : The Rhodian colossus, eight times ten Cubits in height, Laches of Lindos made. He took the bronze of it and carried it over into Syria, and put it up for sale to any who wanted i t ; and a Hebrew of Edessa bought it and brought it up from the sea laden on 980 camels. On the death of Outhman, then, this Mauias succeeded to the rule of the Arabs. And he ruled over the holy city and the region of Palestine, over Damascus and Antioch and all the cities of Egypt. But Alim, who was son-in-law of Mouameth, having married his daughter called Fatime, ruled over Ethribos and all Arabia Tracheia. Now, in these days Alim and Mauias were roused up to war against one

another, disputing over the rule, which of them should be lord of all Syria. They encountered one another by the river Euphrates, and joined in fierce battle one against the other. But when the battle was at its height and many were falling on either side, the multitudes of the Agarenes of both parties cried out: «Why is this, that we slay and are slain, and our tribe perishes from among living men? But let two elders be chosen apart from both the parties, and whomsoever they prefer, let him have the rule.» Alim and Mauias were pleased at this saying of theirs, and, drawing off from their hands their rings, which are a token of rule of the Agarenes, they gave them to the two elders, and placed their authority at the disposal of the two elders, confirming the matter by an oath and settling it so that whomso ever the elders might prefer, he should be lord and chief of all the Saracens. The two elders entered into the middle of the battle array of the two parties, and took their stand face to face in the space between the armies ; the elder of Alim was a man devout according to the nation of the Saracens, one such as they call 'cadi’, that is, faithful and sanctified ; but the elder of Mauias was devout only in appearance, but in all else deceitful and arrogant and surpassing all men in mischief. The elder of Mauias said to the elder of Alim : «Do you speak first what you will, for you are prudent and devout, and far surpassing my years.» And the elder of Alim answered thus : «I cast Alim off from the rule, as I drew his ring from his hand and drew it on to my own finger ; now will I cast off the ring of Alim from my finger and therewith cast him off from his rule also.» The elder of Mauias made answer again : «I drew Mauias into the rule, as I drew his ring on to my finger ; now will I draw the ring of Mauias on to his finger.» And then they parted one from the other. So Mauias took all the dominion of Syria, since all the emirs had sworn to each other, saying : «Whatever the elders say, we will be obedient to their words.» And so Alim took his army and departed to the region of Ethribos with all his kin, and there ended his life.

the death of Alim, his sons, regarding their father’s counsel as nonsense, rebelled against Mauias, and joined fierce battle with Mauias, and being worsted fled from before his face, and Mauias sent after and put them all to death. And thereafter the rule over all the Arabs came into the hands of Mauias. Now, this Mauias was grandson of Sophiam. And Mauias’ grandson was Masalmas, who made an expedition against Constantinople, and at whose request was built the mosque of the Saracens in the imperial praetorium. He was not chief of the Arabs ; Souleiman was chief of the Saracens, and Masalmas held the rank of general. Souleiman came with his fleet against Constantinople, and Masalmas came overland, and crossed over at Lampsacus into the region of Thrace, carrying with him 80 thousand troops. And through the Providence of God both the fleet of Souleiman and the infantry army of Masalmas all retired with ignominy, being worsted and utterly overthrown by the fleet and soldiers of the emperor. And our state was at peace for many a long year, for this city was guided and guarded by Our Lady the ever-virgin Mary, the Mother of God, by whose inviolate and holy image Suleiman himself was awed and put to shame, and he fell from his horse.

peace on these conditions : the emperor to withdraw the Mardaite legion from the Lebanon and check their incursions, and Abimelech to give the Romans daily a thousand nomismata and one thoroughbred horse and one Ethiopian slave, and the taxes of Cyprus and Armenia and Iberia to be held commonly and in equal shares by both parties. The emperor dis patched Paul the imperial agent to Abimelech, to confirm the terms agreed upon, and a confirmation was drawn up in writing and attested. The im perial agent was presented with gifts, and returned. And the emperor sent and took in the Mardaites, 12 thousand of them, thereby crippling the Roman power. For all the frontier cities now inhabited by the Arabs from Mopsouestia and as far as Armenia Quarta were defenceless and uninhabited because of the incursion of the Mardaites, by whose drawing away Romania has suffered terrible damage at the hands of the Arabs, and suffers it still. And in the same year the emperor went to Armenia and there took in the Mardaites of the Lebanon, thus destroying his brazen wall. Moreover, he broke the pledge of peace with the Bulgarians, and disturbed the regular principles laid down by his father. It w'as also during the reign of Abimelech that the Arabs marched against Africa and took it, and placed in it a garrison of their troops. At that time Leontius had expelled Justinian from the rule over the Romans, and had exiled him to Cherson and had possessed himself of the empire. But after Apsimarus Tiberius had succeeded Leontius and had possessed himself of the empire and the sceptre of the Romans, Abimelech, chief of the Arabs, died, and Oualid his son ruled nine years. In the same year Justinian returned once more to his throne, and during his slack and careless government the Agarenes obtained complete control of Africa. Then, the grandson of Mauias with a very few men crossed over into Spain, and, having collected together all of his tribe, gained control of Spain even to this day, and that is why the Agarenes who dwell in Spain are called Mauiates. Their descendants are the Agarenes who live in Crete. For when Michael the Lisper had got possession of the rule over the Romans, and the rebellion of Thomas broke out and lasted three years, then, while the emperor was

engrossed with the troubles which had arisen, the Agarenes who lived in Spain saw their chance had come, fitted out a large fleet and started out from the region of Sicily and desolated all the islands of the Cyclades, and, coming to Crete and finding it rich and carelessly guarded, since none opposed or engaged them, they took it, and hold it to this day. Oualid was succeeded by Souleiman, who ruled three years. In his time Masalmas, the general of Souleiman, made an expedition with an army overland, and Oumar by sea, and by God’s aid they returned with shame, their purpose unachieved. Souleiman was succeeded by Oumar, who held the rule over the Arabs two years. Oumar was succeeded by Azid, who held the rule for four years. He was succeeded by Isam, who held rule for 19 years. On his death Marouam held the rule six years. On the death of Marouam Abdelas became master of the rule over the Arabs, and held it 21 years. On his death Madis became chief of the Arabs, and held the rule nine years. When he had passed away Aaron became master of the rule over the Arabs, and held the rule 23 years. At this year, that is to say, when the rule over the Romans * * * Irene and Constantine, the year from the creation of the world 6288. In the same year Aaron, the chief of the Arabs, died in inner Persia, that is called Chorasan, and Moamed his son succeeded to the rule, a stupid, unbalanced man in every way, against whom his brother Abdelas came in revolt out of that same country of Chorasan together with the powers that had been his father’s, and brought about a civil war. And thereafter those who dwelt in Syria and Egypt and Libya were split up under different governments, and destroyed the public'weal and one another, in a welter of slaughter and rapine and outrage of every sort against themselves and their Christian subjects. Then it was that the churches in the holy city of Christ our God

This anarchy, during which they murdered one another and us, lasted five years. Up to this point the history of the Arabs is set in order chronologically by St. Theophanes, who founded the monastery of the so-called Megás Agros and was uncle on the mother’s side of the great and pious and most Christian emperor Constantine, son of Leo, the most wise and virtuous emperor, and grandson of Basil, of blessed memory for his tenure of the sceptre over the empire of the Romans.

There are two Iberias : one, at the Pillars of Hercules, is so called from the river Iber, mentioned by Apollodorus in 'Concerning the Earth’, II : «Within the Pyrenees is the Iber, a great river running towards the inland sea.» In this country are said to be many distinct nations, as Herodorus has written in the Xth book of his 'History Relating to Herakles’ : «This Iberian race, which, I say, lives on the shores of the strait, though one race, is distinguished by names according to its tribes : first, those who inhabit the western parts at the farthest verge are called Kynetes (and after them, if one travels northward, are the Gletes) ; then, Tartessians ; then, Elbusinians; then, Mastienoi; then, Kelkianoi; and then, thereafter, the Rhone.j) Artemidorus, in book II of the 'Geography’, says that the country is divided thus : «The interior between the Pyrenees mountains and the district about Gadara is denominated alternatively Iberia and Spain. It has been divided by the Romans into two provinces * * * the whole extendingV

from the Pyrenees mountains as far as New Carthage and the sources of the Baetis, while the second province comprehends the area reaching to Gadara and Lusitania.» The form 'Iberite’ is also found. Parthenius in 'Leucadiae’ : «Thou shalt coast along the 'Iberite’ shore.» The other Iberia is over toward the Persians. The ethnic term is 'Iberians’, like 'Pierians’, 'Byzerians’. Dionysius : «Nigh unto the Pillars the nation of great-hearted 'Iberians’.» And Aristophanes, 'Triphales’ : «Learning that the 'Iberians’, who anciently of Aristarchus», and, «The 'Iberians’, whom thou lendest me, to run to my aid.» And Artemidorus in part two of 'Geography’: «Those of the 'Iberians’ who live on the coast use the alphabet of the Italians.» Also, from genitive 'Iberos’ is formed the feminine 'Iberis’. «A Greek woman, not an 'Iberis’», Menander, 'Aspis’. The form 'Iberic’ is also found: «The first sea is the 'Iberic’ at the outset.» Iberia used to be divided in two, but now in three, as Marcian says in its 'Circumnavigation’ : «Now of old Iberia was divided in two by the Romans, but now in three : Baetic Spain and Lusitanian Spain and Tarragonese Spain.» From genitive 'Iberos’ Apollonius derives a nominative, as 'phylakos’ from genitive 'phylakos’. In 'Paronyma’ he says: «Nominatives are derived from genitives of more than two syllables which, like the derivative nominative, carry the proparoxytone accent, whether these are in simple or compound form. Simple are : martyr, martyros, nominative martyros; Charops, Charopos, nominative Charopos, 'of king Charopos’ ; Troezen, Troezenos, nominative Troezenos, 'son of Troezenos’ ; Iber ,Iberos, nominative Iberos» ; whence in Quadratus, ' Roman Millennium’,

V, occurs the dative plural 'Iberoisin’, thus: «Though warring at once with the Ligurians and 'Iberoisi’.» Habro says the same in 'Paronyma’. And «the goat-bearded 'Iberos’ himself» is found in the 'Effeminates’ of Cratinus. The Iberians are said to drink water, a~> Athenaeus says in Deipnosophists’, I I : «Phylarchus in book VII says that all the Iberians too drink water, though they are the wealthiest of mankind (for they possess very great quantities of silver and gold), and he says that they never eat but once in the day out of their parsimony, and wear the most magnificent clothes.»
24. Of S p a i n .
Whence is the name Spain? From Hispanus, a giant so called. The Spains are two provinces of Italy : one is large, the other small. The country is referred to by Charax in 'Chronicles’, X : «In Little, or Outer, Spain the Lusitanians again revolted, and the Romans sent against them their general Quintus». And, of the two provinces together, the same author writes: «Quin tus, the Roman commander-in-chief in both the Spains. He was defeated by Viriathus and made a truce with him.» He says the country is called Iberia, in 'Greek History’, III : «Spain the Greeks originally called Iberia, not yet having learnt the title of the whole nation but calling it all after that part of the country which is near the river Iber and derives its name therefrom.» Afterwards, they say, the name was changed to Panonia.

of the Africans ; it happened like this. There were two generals, Aetius and Boniface, whom Theodosius had sent to Rome at the request of Valentinian. Boniface was given the command over western Libya, and Aetius out of jealousy slanderously accused him of meditating rebellion and working to seize Libya. This he communicated to Piacidia, the mother of Valentinian. But he wrote also to Boniface, saying : «If you are sent for, do not come, for you have been slanderously accused, and the emperor and empress are trying to get you into their hands by a trick.» This message Boniface received and, trusting in Aetius as in a true friend, did not go when he was sent for. Then the emperor and empress accepted Aetius as a loyal servant. At that time the Goths and many very large nations were settled in the regions of the far north down as far as the Danube. Of these the most notable are the Goths, Visigoths, Gepedes and Vandals, who differ from one another in name only and in nothing else, and speak one and the same tongue ; and all are of the misbelief of Arius. These in the time of Arcadius and Honorius crossed the Danube and settled in the territory of the Romans. The Gepedes, from whom were later divided off the Lombards and Avars, lived in the territories about Singidunum and Sirmium. The Visigoths, under Alaric, after taking Rome, went off to the Gallic provinces and possessed themselves of those regions. The Goths first held Pannonia, but afterwards were permitted by Theodosius the younger, in the 19th year of his reign, to dwell in the territories of Thrace, and after remaining 58 years in Thrace they obtained permission of Zeno to possess themselves of the western kingdom, with their leader the patrician and consul Theodoric. The Vandals, joining up with the Alans and Germans, who are now called Franks, crossed the river Rhine, and, under the leadership of Gogidisclus, settled in Spain, the first country of Europe from the side of the western Ocean. Now, Boni face, fearing the emperor and empress of the Romans, crossed over from

Libya into Spain and came to the Vandals, and finding that Gogidisclus was dead and that his sons Gottharus and Gezerichus held the rule, he incited them by a promise to divide western Libya in three parts, so that each of them, with himself, should rule over a third share, and all should unite to repel any enemy whoever he might be. These terms being agreed upon, the Vandals crossed the strait and settled in Libya, from the Ocean as far as Tripolis by Cyrene. The Visigoths, advancing from Gaul, took possession of Spain also. Now, some Roman senators who were friends to Boniface exposed to Piacidia the falsity of Aetius’ accusation, and showed her also the letter of Aetius, which Boniface had sent them. Piacidia, much amazed, forbore to injure Aetius, but dispatched to Boniface a message recalling him to his duty, together with promises on oath. Now, on the death of Gottharius Gezerichus had become sole chief of the Vandals. Boniface, then, on receipt of the message, marched against the Vandals, with a large force which had come to him from Rome and Byzantium under the command of Aspar. Battle was joined with Gezerichus and the army of the Romans was defeated. So Boniface, accompanied by Aspar, came to Rome and dispelled suspicion by exposing the truth. But Africa fell beneath the Vandals. It was then that Marcian, the future emperor, who was a soldier in the service of Aspar, was taken alive by Gezerichus. There are three commanders of the faithful in the whole of Syria, that is, in the empire of the Arabs, the first of whom has his seat at Bagdad and is of the family of Mouameth, or Mahomet; the second has his seat in Africa, and is of the family of Alim and Fatime, daughter of Mouameth, or Mahomet, whence the Fatemites are so called ; the third has his seat in Spain, and he is of the family of Mauias. Originally, when the Saracens made themselves masters over all Syria, the commander of the faithful had his seat at Bagdad. He was absolute ruler over Persia and Africa and Egypt and Arabia Felix. He had beneath him mighty emirates, or military provinces, as follows : first, the emirate of Persia, or Chorasan ; second, the emirate of Africa ; third, the emirate

But after Africa was torn away from the dominion of the commander of the faithful at Bagdad and had become self-governing and had proclaimed an emir of its own, then Persia was the first emirate, as it had been before, and Egypt became the second, and the rest thereafter in the order given above. But now, again, owing to the impotence of the commander of the faithful at Bagdad, the emir of Persia, or Chorasan, has become independent; and he has usurped the style of commander of the faithful, wearing the korán on tablets about his neck like a necklace. And he says he is jrom the family of Alim. Moreover the emir of Arabia Felix used always invariably to be beneath the dominion of the emir of Egypt. But he too has become independent, and he too has usurped the style of commander of the faithful ; and he too says he is of the family of Alim.

The great Lothair, king of Italy, grandfather of the illustrious king Hugh, was by descent of the family of the great Charles, a man much cele brated in song and story and author of heroic deeds in war. This Charles was sole ruler over all the kingdoms, and reigned as emperor in great Francia. And in his days none of the other kings dared call himself a king, but all were his vassals ; and he sent much money and abundant treasure to Palestine and built a very large number of monasteries. Well, this Lothair took his forces and marched against Rome and assaulted and got possession of it, and was crowned by the pope of that time. And when he was on his way back to his domain, that is, to Papia, he got as far as the city of Piacenza, thirty miles distant from Papia, and there he died ; he begat a son called Adalbert, who took to wife the great Bertha, and begat on her the aforesaid king Hugh. Now, after the death of the great Lothair, Lewis, kinsman

of Lewis, came from great Francia and took possession of Papia. He was not crowned. And afterwards he came to Verona, a city 120 miles from Papia, and on his arrival there the folk of that same city rose up against him and seized and blinded him. Then the rule was seized by Berengar, grandfather of the present Berengar, and he entered Rome and was crowned. After this, a large body of the folk made a declaration to Rodolf, who was in Burgundy, saying: «Come here, and we will give the kingdom over to you and will kill Berengar.» So he came from Burgundy to the region of Papia, and one half of the folk sided with Berengar, and the rest with Rodolf. They fought and Berengar was victorious in the first battle, and they fought again and Rodolf gained the victory. And the army of Berengar fled, and Berengar, left alone by himself, made as though he were dead, and fell down among the dead and covered himself with his shield, but left his leg protruding. One of Rodolf’s soldiers came up and stabbed him in the leg with a spear, but he never stirred a muscle ; and when he did not stir, he let him alone, supposing him in truth to be a corpse. And the army of Rodolf did not know that he was Berengar. When the battle was over, Berengar got up and came to his palace alone, and again got possession of his throne and fought with Rodolf and gained the victory over him. Thereafter they came to terms with one another and divided the country in two ; and one of them took one part of the country, and the other the other. But Rodolf was subject to the counsel and authority of Berengar. After this, again, three marquises came from Burgundy to Papia with intent to expel its possessors and possess it themselves ; they were Hugh Tagliaferro, and Boso, and Boso’s brother Hugh, the most noble king aforesaid. And he came with a large army. When Berengar heard of it, he made ready and advanced to meet him in battle, and began to blockade and to reduce them by hunger, and gave orders to his army not to kill any, but if they should take any of them prisoner, to cut off his nose and his two ears and let him go ; and so they did. When they saw this, the three chiefs aforesaid took the holy gospels in their hands and came barefoot to Berengar and begged his pardon and swore that they would never more come there so long as he should live ; and then he let them depart to their

own country. But afterwards, when Berengar had gone to Verona, he was slain by Flambert, whose child he had held at the font, and then Rodolf became possessed of the whole kingdom. And after that the folk of the whole country sent a message to Burgundy, to the aforesaid king Hugh, saying : «Come, and we will give the country over to you.» And when he came, the folk raised him up, and brought him away to the palace and restored to him the throne. But to Rodolf they said : «Depart with your treasure, either to your country or elsewhere, as you will.» So he went off to Burgundy, to his country, and there ruled over a large folk. And when he died, the aforesaid king Hugh went off to Burgundy and took to wife the widow of Rodolf, who was also called Bertha. And her daughter, Adelesa by name, he gave to Lothair his son, who is now king of Italy. Now, she who came up to Constantinople and was joined in marriage to Romanus, the son born in the purple of Constantine, the Christ-loving sovereign, was the daughter of the same illustrious king Hugh, and she was called Bertha after the name of her grandmother, I mean the great Bertha, who after the death of Adalbert her husband reigned ten years ; but she, the young Bertha, changed her name to Eudocia, after that of the grandmother and sister of Constantine, the Christ-loving sovereign.

In ancient times the whole domain of Italy, both Naples and Capua and Beneventum, Salerno and Amalfi and Gaéta and all of Lombardy, was in the possession of the Romans, I mean, when Rome was the imperial capital. But after the seat of empire was remo ed to Constantinople, all these territories were divided into two governments, and therefore two patricians used to be dispatched by the emperor in Constantinople ; one patrician would govern Sicily and Calabria and Naples and Amalfi, and the other, with his seat at Beneventum, would govern Papia and Capua and all the rest. They used to remit annually to the emperor the sums due to the treasury.

All these countries aforesaid used to be inhabited by the Romans. But in the time of the empress Irene the patrician Narses was sent out and was governing Beneventum and Papia; and pope Zacharias, the Athenian, was governing Rome. It happened that fighting had been going on in the region of Papia, and the patrician Narses had expended on the army the tribute collected for the treasury, and the regular revenue was not remitted by him. Narses sent back a reply, saying : «I expect, rather, that money should be sent to me from your side, since I have exhausted all the revenues incoming from here upon the fighting that has broken o u t; but, on the contrary, it is you who are demanding revenues from here.» When the empress heard this she flew into a rage and sent him a spindle and distaff, and wrote to him : «Take these, your proper instruments ; for we have judged it fit that you should spin, rather than that as a man at arms you should defend and guide and do battle for the Romans.» On hearing this the patrician Narses wrote in reply to the empress : «Since I am thus judged by you fit to spin and twist like a woman, I will twist you hanks with spindle and distaff such as the Romans shall never be able to unravel so long as they endure». Now, at that time the Lombards were dwelling in Pannonia, where now the Turks live. And the patrician Narses sent to them fruits of all kinds and made them this declaration : «Come hither and behold a land flowing with honey and milk, as the saying is, which, I think, God has none to surpass ; and if it please you, settle in it, that you may call me blessed for the ages of ages.» The Lombards heard and obeyed and took their families and came to Beneventum. The inhabitants of the city of Beneventum did not allow them to come inside the city, and they settled outside the city, near the wall and by the river, where they built a small city, which for that reason is called Civita Nova, that is, New City, and it stands to this day. But they began to come inside the city also and into the church, and having by a strategem gained the upper hand of the inhabi tants of the city of Beneventum, they made away with them all and took possession of the city. For they carried swords inside their staves, and in the church they wheeled round and instantly attacked and, as has been said, killed everyone. And thereafter they marched out

and subdued all that land, both the province of Lombardy and Calabria and as far as Papia, except for Otranto and Gallipoli and Rosiano and Naples and Gaéta and Sorrento and Amalfi. The first city, ancient and mighty, was Capua, the second, Naples, the third, Beneventum, the fourth, Gaeta, the fifth, Amalfi. Salerno was settled in the time of Sicardus, when the Lombards divided the principalities. From the division of Lombardy until to-day, the 7th indiction, the year 6457 from the creation of the world, it is 200 years. There were two brothers, Sicon and Sicardus. Sicon governed Beneventum and the districts of Bari and Sipontum, and Sicardus governed Salerno and Capua and the district of Calabria. Naples was anciently the praetorium of the patricians who came out, and the governor of Naples had Sicily beneath him as well, and when the patrician arrived in Naples, the duke of Naples would go off to Sicily. Capua was a very large city indeed, and was captured by the Vandals, or Africans, who demolished it. When it was lying a deserted city, the Lombards settled in it. When the Africans came against them once more, bishop Landulf built a city at the bridge over the river and called it New Capua, and it still survives. From the foundation of this Capua, it is 73 years. Naples and Amalfi and Sorrento have always been subject to the emperor of the Romans. 'Mastromilis’ means in the Roman tongue captain-general of the army. Before the Venetians crossed over and settled in the islands in which they live now, they were called Enetikoi, and used to dwell on the mainland in these cities: the city of Concordia, the city of Justiniana, the city of Nonum and very many other cities. When those who are now called Venetians, but were originally called Enetikoi, crossed over, they began by constructing a strongly fortified city, in which the doge of Venice still has his seat to-day, a city surrounded by some six miles of sea, into which 27 rivers also debouch. There are other islands also to the east of this same city. And upon these same islands also they who are now called Venetians built cities : the city of Cogradon, in

Of old, Venice was a desert place, uninhabited and swampy. Those who are now called Venetians were Franks from Aquileia and from the other places in Francia, and they used to dwell on the mainland opposite Venice. But when Attila, the king of the Avars, came and utterly devastated and depopulated all the parts of Francia, all the Franks from Aquileia and from the other cities of Francia began to take to flight, and to go to the uninhabited islands of Venice and to build huts there, out of their dread of king Attila. Now when this king Attila had devastated all the country of the mainland and had advanced as far as Rome and Calabria and had left Venice far in his wake, those who had fled for refuge to the islands of Venice, having obtained a breathing-space and, as it were, shaken off their faintness of heart, took counsel jointly to settle there, which they did, and have been settled there till this day. But again, many years after the with drawal of Attila, king Pippin arrived, who at that time was ruling over

Papia and other kingdoms. For this Pippin had three brothers, and they were ruling over all the Frank and Slavonic regions. Now when king Pippin came against the Venetians with power and a large army, he blockaded them along the mainland, on the far side of the crossing between it and the islands of Venice, at a place called Aeibolas. Well, when the Venetians sawking Pippin coming against them with his power and preparing to take ship with the horses to the island of Madamaucon (for this is an island near the mainland), they laid down spars and fenced off the whole crossing. The army of king Pippin, being brought to a stand (for it was not possible for them to cross at any other point), blockaded them along the mainland six months, fighting with them daily. The Venetians would man their ships and take up position behind the spars they had laid down, and king Pippin would take up position with his army along the shore. The Venetians assailed them with arrows and javelins, and stopped them from crossing over to the island. So then king Pippin, at a loss, said to the Venetians : «You are beneath my hand and my providence, since you are of my country and domain.» But the Venetians answered him : «We want to be servants of the emperor of the Romans, and not of you.» When, however, they had for long been straitened by the trouble that had come upon them, the Venetians made a treaty of peace with king Pippin, agreeing to pay him a very considerable tribute. But since that time the tribute has gone on diminishing year by year, though it is paid even to this day. For the Venetians pay to him who rules over the kingdom of Italy, that is, Papia, a twopenny fee of 36 pounds of uncoined silver annually. So ended the war between Franks and Venetians. When the folk began to flee away to Venice and to collect there in numbers, they proclaimed as their doge him who surpassed the rest in nobility. The first doge among them had been appointed before king Pippin came against them. At that time the doge’s residence was at a place called Civitanova, which means 'new city’. But because this island aforesaid is close to the mainland, by common consent they moved the doge’s residence to another island, where it now is at this present, because it is at a distance from the mainland, as far off as one may see a man on horseback.

in it.
The emperor Diocletian was much enamoured of the country of Dal matia, and so he brought folk with their families from Rome and settled them in this same country of Dalmatia, and they were called 'Romani’ from their having been removed from Rome, and this title attaches to them until this day. Now this emperor Diocletian founded the city of Spalato and built therein a palace beyond the power of any tongue or pen to describe, and remains of its ancient luxury are still to be seen to-day, though the long lapse of time has played havoc with it. Moreover, the city of Diocleia, now occupied by the Diocletians, was built by the same emperor Dio cletian, for which reason those of that country have come to be called by the name of 'Diocletians’. The territory possessed by these Romani used to extend as far as the river Danube, and once on a time, being minded to cross the river and discover who dwelt beyond the river, they crossed it and came upon unarmed Slavonic nations, who were called Avars. The former had not expected that any dwelt beyond the river, nor the latter that any dwelt on the hither side. And so, finding these Avars unarmed and unprepared for war, the Romani overcame them and took their booty and prisoners and returned. And from that time the Romani formed two alternating garrisons, serving from Easter to Easter, and used to change their men about so that on Great and Holy Saturday they who were coming back from the station and they who were going out to that service would meet one another. For near the sea, beneath that same city, lies a city called Salona, which is half as large as Constantinople, and here all the Romani would muster and be equipped and thence start out and come to the frontier pass, which is four miles from this same city, and is called Kleisa to this day, from its closing in those who pass that way. And from there they would advance to the river. This exchange of garrisons went on for a number of years and the Slavs on the far side of the river, who were called Avars, thought it over among themselves, and said : «These Romani, now that they have crossed over and found booty, will in future not cease coming over against us, and so we will devise a plan against them.» And so, therefore, the Slavs, or Avars, took counsel, and on one occasion when the Romani had crossed over, they laid ambushes

and attacked and defeated them. The aforesaid Slavs took the Roman arms and standards and the rest of their military insignia and crossed the river and came to the frontier pass, and when the Romani who were there saw them and beheld the standards and accoutrements of their own men they thought they were their own men, and so, when the aforesaid Slavs reached the pass, they let them through. Once through, they instantly expelled the Romani and took possession of the aforesaid city of Salona. There they settled and thereafter began gradually to make plundering raids and de stroyed the Romani who dwelt in the plains and on the higher ground and took possession of their lands. The remnant of the Romani escaped to the cities of the coast and possess them still, namely, Decatera, Ragusa, Spalato, Tetrangourin, Diadora, Arbe, Vekla and Opsara, the inhabitants of which are called Romani to this day. Since the reign of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, as will he related in the narrative concerning the Groats and Serbs, the whole of Dalmatia and the nations about it, such as Croats, Serbs, Zachlumi, Terbouniotes, Kanalites, Diocletians and Arentani, who are also called Pagani * * *. But when the Roman empire, through the sloth and inexperience of those who then governed it and especially in the time of Michael from Amorion, the Lisper, had declined to the verge of total extinction, the inhabi tants of the cities of Dalmatia became independent, subject neither to the emperor of the Romans nor to anybody else, and, what is more, the nations of those parts, the Croats and Serbs and Zachlumites, Terbuniotes and Kana lites and Diocletians and the Pagani, shook off the reins of the empire of the Romans and became self-governing and independent, subject to none. Princes, as they say, these nations had none, but only 'zupans’, elders, as is the rule in the other Slavonic regions. Moreover, the majority of these Slavs were not even baptized, and remained unbaptized for long enough. Butio

in the time of Basil, the Christ-loving emperor, they sent diplomatic agentsr begging and praying him that those of them who were unbaptized might receive baptism and that they might be, as they had originally been, subject to the empire of the Romans; and that glorious emperor, of blessed memory, gave ear to them and sent out an imperial agent and priests with him and baptized all of them that were unbaptized of the aforesaid nations, and after baptizing them he then appointed for them princes whom they themselves approved and chose, from the family which they themselves loved and favoured. And from that day to this their princes come from these same families, and from no other. But the Pagani, who are called Arentani in the Roman tongue, were left unbaptized, in an inaccessible and precipitous part of the country. For 'Pagani’ means'unbaptized’ in the Slavonic tongue. But later, they too sent to the same glorious emperor and begged that they too might be baptized, and he sent and baptized them too. And since, as we said above, owing to the sloth and inexperience of those in power things had gone the wrong way for the Romans, the inhabitants of the cities of Dalmatia also had become independent, subject neither to the emperor of the Romans nor to anybody else. But after some time, in the reign of Basil the glorious and ever-memorable emperor, Saracens from Africa, Soldan and Saba and Kalphus, came with 36 ships and reached Dalmatia and took the city of Butova and the city of Rossa and the lower city of Decatera. And they came also to the city of Ragusa and blockaded it fifteen months. Then in their strait the Ragusans made a declaration to Basil, the ever-memorable emperor of the Romans, saying this to him: «Have pity on us and do not allow us to be destroyed by them that deny Christ.» The emperor was moved with compassion and sent the patrician Nicetas, admiral of the fleet, surnamed Ooryphas, with one hundred ships of war. When the Saracens learnt of the arrival of the patrician admiral of the fleet with

his squadron, they quitted the city of Ragusa and took to flight and crossed over into Lombardy and laid siege to the city of Bari and took it. Then Soldan built a palace there and was for forty years master of all Lombardy as far as Rome. On this account, therefore, the emperor sent to Lewis, king of Francia, and to the pope of Rome, asking their cooperation with the army which he, the emperor, had sent. The king and the pope acceded to the emperor’s request, and both of them came with a large force and joined up with the army sent by the emperor and with the Croat and Serb and Zachlumian contingents and the Terbouniotes and Kanalites and the men of Ragusa and all the cities of Dalmatia (for all these were present by imperial mandate) ; and they crossed over into Lombardy, and laid siege to the city of Bari and took it. The Croats and the other chiefs of the Slavs were carried over into Lombardy by the inhabitants of the city of Ragusa in their own vessels. The city of Bari and the country and all the prisoners were taken by the emperor of the Romans, but Soldan and the rest of the Saracens were taken by Lewis, the king of Francia, who carried them off to the city of Capua and the city of Beneventum. And no one saw Soldan laughing. And the king said : «If anybody truly reports to me or shows me Soldan laughing, I will give him much money.» Later, someone saw him laughing and reported it to king Lewis. He summoned Soldan and asked him, how he had come to laugh? And he said : «I saw a cart and the wheels on it turning round and therefore I laughed because I too was once at the top and am now lowest of all, but God may raise me up again.» And thereafter Lewis would summon

him to his table and would eat with him. And the nobles of Capua and Beneventum used to go to Soldan and ask him questions about the treatment and care of cattle and other matters, because of his age and experience. And Soldan, who was cunning and crooked, said to them: «I would like to say a thing to you, but I fear to be betrayed by you to the king and I shall lose my life.» But they swore to him, and he took heart and said to them: «The king is minded to banish all of you to great Francia, and if you disbelieve it, wait a little, and I will satisfy you.» And he went off and said to Lewis: «The nobles of this place are evil, and you cannot be master of this country unless you destroy the powerful men who oppose you ; but do you bind the first men of the city and send them off to your country, and then the rest will be submissive to you, as you desire.» When he had won him to carrying out his advice, and the king had instructed that chains of iron should be made for their banishment, Soldan went off and said to the nobles: «Do you still not believe that the king is sending you into banishment, and that all remem brance of you will vanish from among men? Yet, if you will be perfectly satisfied, go and see what all the smiths are making by order of the king. And if you do not find them making the chains and fetters, know that all I have told you is lies; but if I speak truth, look to your safety and reward me for my valuable and salutary advice to you.» The nobles obeyed the word of Soldan, and when they had seen the chains and fetters, they were comple tely satisfied, and thereafter began to devise the destruction of king Lewis. The king, in ignorance of all this, went out hunting. But when he came back, his nobles had taken possession of the city and did not allow him to enter. King Lewis, seeing himself thus opposed by the nobles, went back to his own country. The nobles said to Soldan : «What, then, would you have us do for you, in return for the salvation wrought for us by you?» And he requested them to dismiss him to his own country, which they did, and he went off to Africa, to his own country. But, mindful of his ancient malice, he made an expedition and came with a force to Capua and to Beneventum, to lay siege to and subdue them. The rulers of these cities sent envoys to king Lewis in Francia, asking him to come and help them fight against Soldan and the Africans. But king Lewis, when he heard of it, having learnt

how Soldan had acted in persuading the nobles that, «the king purposes to send you in chains to banishment in Francia», declared in answer to them : «I repent my former conduct towards you, when I saved you from your enemies, and you returned me evil for good ; and as I was cast out by you, now I rejoice at your destruction.» Then, having failed with king Lewis, they sent envoys to the emperor of the Romans, asking that he should give them aid and deliver them out of this danger. The emperor promised to aid them. But when the diplomatic agent had left Constantinople on his homeward way, bringing back to them who had sent him fair tidings of the alliance with the emperor, he was still short of the city when he was captured by the scouts of Soldan. For Soldan had obtained previous intel ligence of the sending of a mission of supplication to the emperor of the Romans and had made efforts to capture their diplomatic agent, which he did. From his captive he learnt of the service he had performed, and that in a few days the succours of the emperor of the Romans would arrive. So Soldan said to this same diplomatic agent : «If you do what I tell you, you shall be awarded freedom and very great gifts ; but if not, you shall lose your life and your death shall be cruel.» The man promised to carry out his orders, and Soldan said to him : «I order you to stand close to the wall and to summon those who sent you and say to them: 'For my part, I have carried out the service laid upon me, and have importuned the emperor of the Romans on your behalf; however, know that my journey was vain, and that the emperor has altogether spurned the supplication you made, and do not expect succour from the emperor’.» When he had promised to perform this gladly, they conducted him close to the city, where, disregarding all that Soldan had said, neither fearing his threats nor seduced by his promises, but setting the fear of God in his heart, he communed thus with himself: «It is expedient that I alone should die, and not entrap and betray so many souls to their death.» Accordingly, when he was near the wall and had summoned the nobles, he thus addressed those who were in authority over that city : «I, my lords, have discharged my office and will announce to you what was declared by the emperor of the Romans ; but I adjure you by the Son of God and the salvation of all the city and of your very souls, to reward, instead of me, my children

and her who is hoping to receive me back, my wife ; for as you deal with them, so shall your reward be from God, the just and righteous rewarder, who shall judge the quick and the dead.» When he had so spoken, he fort ified them with these words : «For my part I shall be destroyed by Soldan and the threat of death is upon me ; but do you stand fast and be not faint hearted, but endure a little while, and in a few days shall arrive the salva tion which has been sent to you by the emperor of the Romans». When he had so spoken, the minions of Soldan who had charge of him, hearing his unexpected message, gnashed with their teeth upon him, and each outran the other to be the author of his taking off. But after he was made away by them, Soldan, dreading the powers of the emperor that were coming upon him, withdrew to his own country. And from that time until this day the men of Capua and the men of Beneventum have been under the authority of the Romans in perfect servitude and subjection, for that great benefit which was done to them. The city of Ragusa is not called Ragusa in the tongue of the Romans, but, because it stands on cliffs, it is called in Roman speech 'the cliff, lau’ ; whence they are called 'Lausaioi’, i. e. 'those who have their seat on the cliff’. But vulgar usage, which frequently corrupts names by altering their letters, has changed the denomination and called them Rausaioi. These same Rausaioi used of old to possess the city that is called Pitaura ; and since, when the other cities were captured by the Slavs that were in the province, this city too was captured, and some were slaughtered and others taken prisoner, those who were able to escape and reach safety settled in the almost precipitous spot where the city now is ; they built it small to begin with, and afterwards enlarged it, and later still extended its wall until the city reached its present size, owing to their gradual spreading out and increase in population. Among those who migrated to Ragusa are : Gregory, Arsaphius, Victorinus, Vitalius, Valentine the archdeacon, Valentine the father of Stephen the protospatharius. From their migration from Salona to Ragusa, it is 500 years till this day, which is the 7th indiction, the year 6457. In this same city lies St. Pancratius, in the church of St. Stephen, which is in the middle of this same city.

The city of Spalato, which means 'little palace’, was founded by the emperor Diocletian ; he made it his own dwelling-place, and built within it a court and a palace, most part of which has been destroyed. But a few things remain to this day, e. g. the episcopal residence of the city and the church of St. Domnus, in which lies St. Domnus himself, and which was the resting-place of the same emperor Diocletian. Beneath it are arching vaults, which used to be prisons, in which he cruelly confined the saints whom he tormented. St. Anastasius also lies in this city. The defence-wall of this city is constructed neither of bricks nor of concrete, but of ashlar blocks, one and often two fathoms in length by a fathom across, and these are fitted and joined to one another by iron cramp puddled into molten lead. In this city also stand close rows of columns, with entablatures above, on which this same emperor Diocletian proposed to erect arching vaults and to cover over the city throughout, and to build his palace and all the living-quarters of the city on the top of those vaults, to a height of two and three stories, so that they covered little ground-space in the same city. The defence-wall of this city has neither rampart nor bulwarks, but only lofty walls and arrow-slits. The city of Tetrangourin is a little island in the sea, with a very narrow neck reaching to the land like a bridge, along which the inhabitants pass to the same city; and it is called Tetrangourin because it is long-shaped like a cucumber. In this same city lies the holy martyr Lawrence the archdeacon. The city of Decatera means in the language of the Romans 'contracted and strangled’, because the sea enters like a contracted tongue for 15 or 20 miles, and the city is on this marine appendix. This city has high mountains in a circle about it, so that the sun can be seen only in summer, because it is then in mid-heaven, and in winter it cannot be seen at all. In the same city lies St. Tryphon, who entirely heals every disease, especially those who are tormented by unclean spirits ; his church is domed. The city of Diadora is called in the language of the Romans 'iam era', which means, 'it was already’ : that is to say, when Rome was founded,

this city had already been founded before it ; it is a big city. Vulgar usage gives it the name Diadora. In the same city lies in the flesh St. Anastasia, the virgin, daughter of Eustathius, who was on the throne at that time; and St. Chrysogonus, monk and martyr, and his holy chain. The church of St. Anastasia is a basilica, like the church of the Chalcopratia, with green and white columns, and all decorated with encaustic pictures in the antique style ; its floor is of wonderful mosaic. Near it is another church, a domed one, Holy Trinity, and above this church again is another church, like a triforium, domed also, into which they mount by a spiral staircase. Under the control of Dalmatia is a close-set and very numerous archi pelago, extending as far as Beneventum, so that ships never fear to be overwhelmed in those parts. One of these islands is the city of Vekla, and on another island Arbe, and on another island Opsara, and on another island Lumbricaton, and these are still inhabited. The rest are uninhabited and have upon them deserted cities, of which the names are as follows : Katautrebeno, Pizouch, Selbo, Skerda, Aloep, Skirdakissa, Pyrotima, Meleta, Estiounez, and very many others of which the names are not intelligible. The remaining cities, on the mainland of the province, which were captured by the said Slavs, now stand uninhabited and deserted, and nobody lives in them.

For this reason we are giving, for the benefit of all who come after us, a plain account both of these matters and of certain others worthy of attention, so that the resulting good may be twofold. They, then, who are inquiring into the taking of Dalmatia also, how it was taken by the nations of the Slavs, may learn of it from what follows ; but first of all its geographical position must be told.

fore, Dalmatia used to start at the confines of Dyrrachium, or Antibari, and used to extend as far as the mountains of Istria, and spread out as far as the river Danube. All this area was under the rule of the Romans, and this province was the most illustrious of all the provinces of the west ; however, it was taken by the nations of the Slavs in the following manner. Near Spalato is a city called Salona, built by the emperor Diocletian ; Spalato itself was also built by Diocletian, and his palace was there, but at Salona dwelt his nobles and large numbers of the common folk. This city was the head of all Dalmatia. Now, every year a force of cavalry from the other cities of Dalmatia used to collect at, and be despatched from Salona, to the number of a thousand, and they would keep guard on the river Danube, on account of the Avars. For the Avars had their haunts on the far side of the river Danube, where now are the Turks, and led a nomad life. The men of Dalmatia who went there every year would often see both beasts and men on the far side of the river. On one occasion, therefore, they decided to cross over and investigate who they were that had their abode there. So they crossed, and found only the women and children of the Avars, the men and youths being on a military expedition. Falling suddenly upon them, therefore, they made them prisoner, and returned unmolested, car rying off this booty to Salona. Now when the Avars came back from their military expedition and learnt what had happened and the losses they had sustained, they were confounded, but know not from what quarter this blow had come upon them. They therefore decided to bide their time and in this way to discover the whole. And so, when according to custom the garrison was once more dispatched from Salona, not the same men as before but others, they too decided to do what their predecessors had done. So they crossed over against them, but finding them massed together, not scattered abroad as on the previous occasion, not merely did they achieve nothing but actually suffered the most frightful reverse. For some of them were slain, and the remainder taken alive, and not one escaped the hand of the enemy. The latter examined them as to who they were and whence they came, and having learnt that it was from them that they had suffered the blow aforesaid, and having moreover found out by enquiry the nature of their homeland and taken a fancy to it as far as they might from hearsay, they held the survivors captive and dressed themselves up in their clothes, just as the others had worn them, and then, mounting the horses and taking

in their hands the standards and the rest of the insignia which the others had brought with them, they all started off in military array and made for Salona. And since they had learnt by enquiry also the time at which the garrison was wont to return from the Danube (which was the Great and Holy Saturday), they themselves arrived on that same day. When they got near, the bulk of the army was placed in concealment, but up to a thousand of them, those who, to play the trick, had acquired the horses and uniforms of the Dalmatians, rode out in front. Those in the city, recogni zing their insignia and dress, and also the day, for upon this day it was customary for them to return, opened the gates and received them with delight. But they, as soon as they were inside, seized the gates and, signal ling their exploit to the army, gave it the cue to run in and enter with them. And so they put to the sword all in the city and thereafter made them selves masters of all the country of Dalmatia and settled down in it. Only the townships on the coast held out against them, and continued to be in the hands of the Romans, because they obtained their livelihood from the sea. The Avars, then, seeing this land to be most fair, settled down in it. But the Groats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Tonga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some years, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was pos sessed by the Groats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also

were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous, and they requested the holy baptism from the bishop of Rome, and bishops were sent who baptized them in the time of Porinos their prince. Their country was divided into 11 'zupanias’, viz., Chlebiana, Tzenzina, Imota, Pleba, Pesenta, Parathalassia, Breberi, Nona, Tnina, Sidraga, Nina ; and their ban possesses Kribasa, Litza and Goutziska. Now, the said Croatia and the rest of the Slavonic regions are situated thus : Diocleia is neighbour to the forts of Dyrrachium, I mean, to Elissus and to Helcynium and Antibari, and comes up as far as Decatera, and on the side of the mountain country it is neighbour to Serbia. From the city of Decatera begins the domain of Terbounia and stretches along as far as Ragusa, and on the side of its mountain country it is neighbour to Serbia. From Ragusa begins the domain of the Zachlumi and stretches along as far as the river Orontius ; and on the side of the coast it is neigh bour to the Pagani, but on the side of the mountain country it is neighbour to the Croats on the north and to Serbia at the front. From the river Orontius begins Pagania and stretches along as far as the river Zentina ; it has three zupanias’, Rhastotza and Mokros and that of Dalén. Two of these 'zupanias’, viz., Rhastotza and that of Mokros, lie on the sea, and possess galleys ; but that of Dalenos lies distant from the sea, and they live by agriculture. Neigh bour to them are four islands, Meleta, Kourkoura, Bratza and Pharos, most fair and fertile, with deserted cities upon them and many olive-yards ; on these they dwell and keep their flocks, from which they live. From the river Zentina begins the country of Croatia and stretches along, on the side of the coast as far as the frontiers of Istria, that is, to the city of Albunum, and on the side of the mountain country it encroaches some way upon

the province of Istria, and at Tzentina and Chlebena becomes neighbour to the country of Serbia. For the country of Serbia is at the front of all the rest of the countries, but on the north is neighbour to Croatia, and on the south to Bulgaria. Now, after the said Slavs had settled down, they took possession of all the surrounding territory of Dalmatia ; but the cities of the Romani took to cultivating the islands and living off them ; since, howe ver, they were daily enslaved and destroyed by the Pagani, they deserted these islands and resolved to cultivate the mainland. But they were stopped by the Croats ; for they were not yet tributary to the Croats, and used to pay to the military governor all that they now pay to the Slavs. Finding it impossible to live, they approached the glorious emperor Basil and told him all the above. And so that glorious emperor Basil ordered that all that was then paid to the military governor they should pay to the Slavs, and live at peace with them, and that some slight payment should be made to the military governor, as a simple token of submission and servitude to the emperors of the Romans and their military governors. And from that time all these cities became tributary to the Slavs, and they pay them fixed sums : the city of Spalato, 200 nomismata ; the city of Tetrangourin, 100 nomismata ; the city of Diadora, 110 nomismata ; the city of Opsara, 100 nomismata ; the city of Arbe, 100 nomumata; the city of Vekla, 100 nomis mata ; so that the total amounts to 710 nomismata, exclusive of wine and various other commodities, which are in excess of the payments in cash. The city of Ragusa is situated between the two countries of the Zachlumi and of Terbounia ; they have their vineyards in both countries, and pay to the prince of the Zachlumi 36 nomismata, and to the prince of Terbounia 36 nomismata.

The Croats who now live in the region of Dalmatia are descended from the unbaptized Croats, also called 'white’, who live beyond Turkey and next to Francia, and have for Slav neighbours the unbaptized Serbs. 'Croats’ in the Slav tongue means 'those who occupy much territory’. These same Croats arrived to claim the protection of the emperor of the Romans Heraclius

before the Serbs claimed the protection of the same emperor Heraclius, at that time when the Avars had fought and expelled from those parts the Romani whom the emperor Diocletian had brought from Rome and settled there, and who were therefore called 'Romani’ from their having been translated from Rome to those countries, I mean, to those now called Croatia and Serbia. These same Romani having been expelled by the Avars in the days of this same emperor of the Romans Heraclius, their countries were made desolate. And so, by command of the emperor Heraclius these same Croats defeated and expelled the Avars from those parts, and by mandate of Heraclius the emperor they settled down in that same country of the Avars, where they now dwell. These same Croats had at that time for prince the father of Porgas. The emperor Heraclius sent and brought priests from Rome, and made of them an archbishop and a bishop and elders and deacons, and baptized the Croats; and at that time these Croats had Porgas for their prince. This country in which the Croats settled themselves was originally under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and hence in the country of these same Croats the palace and hippodromes of the emperor Diocletian are still preserved, at the city of Salona, near the city of Spalato. These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories. And many years after, in the days of prince Terpimer, father of prince Krasimer, there came from Francia that lies between Croatia and Venice a man called Martin, of the utmost piety though clad in the garb of a layman, whom these same Croats

declare to have wrought abundant miracles ; this pious man, who was sick and had had his feet amputated, so that he was carried by four bearers and taken about wherever he wanted to go, confirmed upon these same Croats this injunction of the most holy pope, that they should keep it so long as their life should last; and he himself also pronounced on their behalf a bene diction similar to that which the pope had made. For this reason neither the galleys nor the cutters of these Croats ever go against anyone to make war, unless of course he has come upon them. But in these vessels go those of the Croats who wish to engage in commerce, travelling round from city to city, in Pagania and the gulf of Dalmatia and as far as Venice. The prince of Croatia has from the beginning, that is, ever since the reign of Heraclius the emperor, been in servitude and submission to the emperor of the Romans, and was never made subject to the prince of Bulgaria. Nor has the Bulgarian ever gone to war with the Croats, except when Michael Boris, prince of Bulgaria, went and fought them and, unable to make any headway, concluded peace with them, and made presents to the Croats and received presents from the Croats. But never yet have these Croats paid tribute to the Bulgarians, although the two have often made presents to one another in the way of friendship. In baptized Croatia are the inhabited cities of Nona, Belgrade, Belitzin, Skordona, Chlebena, Stolpon, Tenin, Kori, Klaboka. Baptized Croatia musters as many as 60 thousand horse and 100 thousand foot, and galleys up to 80 and cutters up to 100. The galleys carry 40 men each, the cutters 20 each, and the smaller cutters 10 each. This great power and multitude of men’Croatia possessed until the time of prince Krasimer. But when he was dead and his son Miroslav, after ruling four years, was made away with by the ban Pribounias, and quarrels and numerous dissensions broke out in the country, the horse and foot and galleys and cutters of the Croat dominion were diminished. And now it has 30 galleys and* * * cutters, large and small, and* * * horse and* * * foot.

Great Croatia, also called 'white’, is still unbaptized to this day, as are also the Serbs who are its neighbours. They muster fewer horse and fewer foot than does baptized Croatia, because they are more constantly raided, by the Franks and Turks and Pechenegs. Nor have they either galleys or cutters or merchant-ships, for the sea is far away ; for from those parts to the sea it is a journey of 30 days. And the sea to which they come down after the 30 days is that which is called 'dark’.

The Serbs are descended from the unbaptized Serbs, also called 'white’, who live beyond Turkey in a place called by them Boiki, where their neigh bour is Francia, as is also Great Croatia, the unbaptized, also called 'white’; in this place, then, these Serbs also originally dwelt. But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Iieraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. 'Serbs’ in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves’, whence the colloquial 'serbula’ for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi’ for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Hera clius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in. And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelled from those parts the Romani who now live in Dalmatia and

Dyrrachium), therefore the emperor settled these same Serbs in these countries, and they were subject to the emperor of the Romans; and the emperor brought elders from Rome and baptized them and taught them fairly to perform the works of piety and expounded to them the faith of the Christians. And since Bulgaria was beneath the dominion of the Romans ** Vwhen, therefore, that same Serbian prince died who had claimed the emperor’s protection, his son ruled in succession, and thereafter his grandson, and in like manner the succeeding princes from his family. And after some years was begotten of them Bo'iseslav, and of him Rodoslav, and of him Prosigo’is, and of him Blastimer; and up to the time of this Blastimer the Bulgarians lived at peace with the Serbs, whose neighbours they were and with whom they had a common frontier, and they were friendly one toward another, and were in servitude and submission to the emperors of the Ro mans and kindly entreated by them. But, during the rule of this same Blastimer, Presiam, prince of Bulgaria, came with war against the Serbs, with intent to reduce them to submission ; but though he fought them three years he not merely achieved nothing but also lost very many of his men. After the death of prince Blastimer his three sons, Muntimer and StroTmer and Goinikos, succeeded to the rule of Serbia and divided up the country. In their time came up the prince of Bulgaria, Michael Boris, wishing to avenge the defeat of his father Presiam, and made war, and the Serbs discomfited him to such an extent that they even held prisoner his son Vladimer, together with twelve great boyars. Then, out of grief for his son, Boris *perforce made peace with the Serbs. But, being about to return to Bulgaria and afraid lest the Serbs might ambush him on the way, he begged for his escort the sons of prince Muntimer, Borenas and Stephen, who escorted him safely as far as the frontier at Rasi. For this favour Michael Boris gave them handsome presents, and they in return gave him, as presents in the way of friendship, two slaves, two falcons, two dogs and eighty furs, which the Bulgarians describe as tribute. A short while after, the same three brothers, the princes of Serbia, fell out, and one of them, Muntimer, gained the upper band and, wishing to be sole ruler, seized the other two and handed them over to Bulgaria, keeping by him and caring for only the son

of the one brother Goinikos, Peter by name, who fled and came to Croatia, and of whom we shall speak in a moment. The aforesaid brother Stroimer, who was in Bulgaria, had a son Klonimer, to whom Boris gave a Bulgarian wife. Of him was begotten Tzeéslav, in Bulgaria. Muntimer, who had expel led his two brothers and taken the rule, begat three sons, Pribeslav and Branos and Stephen, and after he died his eldest son Pribeslav succeeded him. Now, after one year the aforesaid Peter, son of Goinikos, came out of Croatia and expelled from the rule his cousin Pribeslav and his two bro thers, and himself succeeded to the rule, and they fled away and entered Croatia. Three years later Branos came to fight Peter and was defeated and captured by him, and blinded. Two years after that, Klonimer, the father of Tzeéslav, escaped from Bulgaria and he too came and with an army and entered one of the cities of Serbia, Dostinika, with intent to take over the rule. Peter attacked and slew him, and continued to govern for another 20 years, and his rule began during the reign of Leo, the holy emperor, of most bles sed memory, to whom he was in submission and servitude. He also made peace with Symeon, prince of Bulgaria, and even made him god-father to his child. Now, after the time that this lord Leo had reigned, the then military governor at Dyrrachium, the protospatharius Leo Rhabduchus, who was afterwards honoured with the rank of magister and office of foreign minister, arrived in Pagania, which was at that time under the control of the prince of Serbia, in order to advise and confer with this same prince Peter upon some service and affair. Michael, prince of the Zachlumi, his jealousy aroused by this, sent information to Symeon, prince of Bulgaria, that the emperor of the Romans was bribing prince Peter to take the Turks with him and go upon Bulgaria. It was at that time when the battle of Achelo had taken place between the Romans and the Bulgarians. Symeon, mad with rage at this, sent against prince Peter of Serbia Sigritzis Theodore and the notorious Marmais with an army, and they took with them also the young prince Paul, son of Branos whom Peter, prince of Serbia, had blinded. The Bulgarians proceeded against the prince of Serbia by treachery, and, by binding him with the relationship of god-father and giving a sworn undertaking that he should suffer nothing untoward at their hands, they tricked him into coming out to them, and then on the instant bound him*V

and carried him off to Bulgaria, and he died in prison. Paul, son of Branos, entered into his room and governed three years. The emperor, the lord Romanus, who had in Constantinople the young prince Zacharias, son of Pribeslav, prince of Serbia, sent him off to be prince in Serbia, and he went and fought, but was defeated by Paul ; who took him prisoner and handed him over to the Bulgarians and he was kept in prison. Then, three years later, when Paul had put himself in opposition to the Bulgarians, they sent this Zacharias, who had previously been sent by the lord Romanus the emperor, and he expelled Paul and himself took possession of the rule over the Serbs ; and thereupon, being mindful of the benefits of the emperor of the Romans, he broke with the Bulgarians, being not at all wishful to be subjected to them, but rather that the emperor of the Romans should be his master. And so, when Symeon sent against him an army under Mar inaim and Sigritzis Theodore, he sent their heads and their armour from the battle to the emperor of the Romans as tokens of his victory (for the war was still going on between the Romans and the Bulgarians) ; nor did he ever cease, just as the princes also that were before him had been used to send missions to the emperors of the Romans, to be in subjection and servitude to them. Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacha rias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans’ that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they in stantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats. Seven years after wards Tzeeslav escaped from the Bulgarians with four others, and entered Serbia from Preslav, and found in the country no more than fifty men only, without wives or children, who supported themselves by hunting. With these he took possession of the country and sent a message to the emperor of the Romans asking for his support and succour, and promising to serve him and be obedient to his command, as had been the princes before him.

And thenceforward the emperor of the Romans continually benefited him, so that the Serbs living in Croatia and Bulgaria and the rest of the countries, whom Symeon had scattered, rallied to him when they heard of it. Moreover, many had escaped from Bulgaria and entered Constantinople, and these the emperor of the Romans clad and comforted and sent to Tzeéslav. And from the rich gifts of the emperor of the Romans he organized and populated the country, and is, as before, in servitude and subjection to the emperor of the Romans ; and through the co-operation and many benefits of the emperor he has united this country and is confirmed in the rule of it. The prince of Serbia has from the beginning, that is, ever since the reign of Heraclius the emperor, been in servitude and submission to the emperor of the Romans, and was never subject to the prince of Bulgaria. In baptized Serbia are the inhabited cities of Destinikon, Tzernabouskei, Megyretous, Dresneik, Lesnik, Salines; and in the territory of Bosona, Katera and Desnik.

The country of the Zachlumi was previously possessed by the Romans, I mean, by those Romani whom Diocletian the emperor translated from Rome, as has been told of them in the story of the Croats. This land of the Zachlumi was beneath the emperor of the Romans, but when it and its folk were enslaved by the Avars, it was rendered wholly desolate. Those who live there now, the Zachlumi, have been Serbs since the time of that prince who claimed the protection of the emperor Heraclius. They were called Zachlumi from a so-called mount Chlumos, and indeed in the tongue of the Slavs 'Zachlumi’ means 'behind the mountain’, since in that territory is a great mountain with two cities on the top of it, Bona and Chlum, and behind this mountain runs a river called Bona, which means 'good’. The family of the proconsul and patrician Michael, son of Bouseboutzis, prince of the Zachlumi, came from the unbaptized who dwell on

The country of the Terbouniotes and the Kanalites is one. The inhabi tants are descended from the unbaptized Serbs, and lived there as Serb from the time of that prince who came out of unbaptized Serbia and claimed the protection of the emperor Heraclius until the time of Blastimer, prince of Serbia. This prince Blastimer married his daughter to Kramas, son of Belaés,'zupán’ of Terbounia. And, desiring to ennoble his son-in-law, he gave him the title of prince and made him independent. Of him was begotten Phalimer, and of him Tzouzimer. The princes of Terbounia have always been at the command of the prince of Serbia. Terbounia in the tongue of the Slavs means 'strong place’ ; for this country has many strong defences. Subordinate to this country of Terbounia is another country ealled Kanali. Kanali means in the tongue of the Slavs 'waggon-load’, because, the place being level, they carry on all their labours by the use of waggons. In the territory of Terbounia and Kanali are the inhabited cities of Terbounia, Ormos, Rhisena, Loukabetai, Zetlibi.

But this country also was enslaved by the Avars and made desolate, and repopulated in the time of Heraclius the emperor, just as were Croatia and Serbia and the country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of Kanali. Diocleia gets its name from the city in this country that the emperor Diocletian founded, but now it is a deserted city, though still called Diocleia. In the country of Diocleia are the large inhabited cities of Gradetai, Nougrade, Lontodokla.

The country in which the Pagani now dwell was also previously pos sessed by the Romani whom the emperor Diocletian translated from Rome and settled in Dalmatia. These same Pagani are descended from the un baptized Serbs, of the time of that prince who claimed the protection of the emperor Heraclius. This country also was enslaved by the Avars and made desolate and repopulated in the time of Heraclius the emperor. The Pagani are so called because they did not accept baptism at the time when all the Serbs were baptized. For 'Pagani’ in the tongue of the Slavs means 'unbaptized’, but in the tongue of the Romans their country is called Arenta, and so they themselves are called Arentani by these same Romans. In Pagania are the inhabited cities of Mokron, Beroullia, Ostrok and Slavinetza. Also, they possess these islands : the large island of Kourkra, or Kikér, on which there is a city ; another large island, Meleta, or Malozeatai, which St. Luke mentions in the 'Acts of the Apostles’ by the name of Melite, in which a viper fastened upon St. Paul by his finger, and St. Paul burnt it up in the fire ; another large island, Phara ; another large island, Bratzis. There are other islands not in the possession of these same Pagani : the island of Choara, the island of les, the island of Lastobon.

Originally, the Pechenegs had their dwelling on the river Atil, and likewise on the river Geich, having common frontiers with the Chazars and the so-called Uzes. But fifty years ago the so-called Uzes made common cause with the Chazars and joined battle with the Pechenegs and prevailed over them and expelled them from their country, which the so-called Uzes have occupied till this day. The Pechenegs fled and wandered round, casting about for a place for their settlement; and when they reached the land which they now possess and found the Turks living in it, they defeated them in battle and expelled and cast them out, and settled in it, and have been masters of this country, as has been said, for fifty-five years to this day. The whole of Patzinacia is divided into eight provinces with the same number of great princes. The provinces are these : the name of the first province is Irtim ; of the second, Tzour ; of the third, Gyla ; of the fourth, Koulpei; of the fifth, Charaboi'; of the sixth, Talmat; of the seventh, Chopon ; of the eighth, Tzopon. At the time at which the Pechenegs were expelled from their country, their princes were, in the province of Irtim, Baitzas ; in Tzour, Kouel; in Gyla, Kourkoutai; in Koulpei, Ipaos ; in Charoboi, Kaidoum ; in the province of Talmat, Kostas ; in Chopon, Giazis ; in the province of Tzopon, Batas. After their deaths their cousins succeeded to their rule. For law and ancient principle have prevailed among them, depri ving them of authority to transmit their rank to their sons or their brothers, it being sufficient for those in power to rule for their own life-time only, and when they die, either their cousin or sons of their cousins must be appointed, so that the rank may not run exclusively in one branch of the family, but the collaterals also inherit and succeed to the honour ; but no one from a stranger family intrudes and becomes a prince. The eight provinces are divided into forty districts, and these have minor princelings over them.

Four clans of the Pechenegs, that is to say, the province of Kouartzitzour and the province of Syroukalpei and the province of Borotalmat and the province of Boulatzopon, lie beyond the Dnieper river towards the eastern and northern parts that face Uzia and Chazaria and Alania and Cherson and the rest of the Regions. The other four clans lie on this side of the Dnieper river, towards the western and northern parts, that is to say that the province of Giazichopon is neighbour to Bulgaria, the province of Kato Gvla is neighbour to Turkey, the province of Charoboi' is neighbour to Russia, and the province of Iabdiertim is neighbour to the tributary territoires of the country of Russia, to the Oultines and Dervlenines and Lenzenines and the rest of the Slavs. Patzinacia is distant a five days journey from Uzia and Chazaria, a six days journey from Alania, a ten days journey from Mordia, one day’s journey from Russia, a four days journey from Turkey, half a day’s journey from Bulgaria ; to Cherson it is very near, and to Bosporus closer still. At the time when the Pechenegs were expelled from their country, some of them of their own will and personal decision stayed behind there and united with the so-called Uzes, and even to this day they live among them, and wear such distinguishing marks as separate them off and betray their origin and how it came about that they were split off from their own folk : for their tunics are short, reaching to the knee, and their sleeves are cut off at the shoulder, whereby, you see, they indicate that they have been cut off from their own folk and those of their race. On this side of the Dniester river, towards the part that faces Bulgaria, at the crossings of this same river, are deserted cities : the first city is that called by the Pechenegs Aspron, because its stones look very white ; the second city is Toungatai; the third city is Kraknakatai; the fourth city is Salmakatai; the fifth city is Sakakatai; the sixth city is Giaioukatai. Among these buildings of the ancient cities are found some distinctive traces of churches, and crosses hewn out of porous stone, whence some preserve a tradition that once on a time Romans had settlements there.

The Pechenegs are also called 'Kangar’, though not all of them, but only the folk of the three provinces of Iabdierti and Kouartzitzour and Chabouxingyla, for they are more valiant and noble than the rest : and that is what the title 'Kangar’ signifies.

The nation of the Turks had of old their dwelling next to Chazaria, m the place called Lebedia after the name of their first voivode, which voivode was called by the personal name of Lebedias, but in virtue of his rank was entitled voivode, as have been the rest after him. Now in this place, the aforesaid Lebedia, there runs a river Chidmas, also called Chingilous. They were not called Turks at that time, but had the name 'Sabartoi asphaloi’, for some reason or other. The Turks were seven clans, and they had never had over them a prince either native or foreign, but there were among them 'voivodes’, of whom first voivode was the aforesaid Lebedias. They lived together with the Chazars for three years, and fought in alliance with the Chazars in all their wars. Because of their courage and their alliance, the chagan-prince of Chazaria gave in marriage to the first voivode of the Turks, called Lebedias, a noble Chazar lady, because of the fame of his valour and the illustriousness of his race, so that she might have children by him ; but, as it fell out, this Lebedias had no children by this same Chazar lady. Now, the Pechenegs who were previously called 'Kangar’ (for this 'Kangar’ was a name signifying nobility and valour among them), these, then, stirred up war against the Chazars and, being defeated, were forced to quit their own land and to settle in that of the Turks. And wrhen battle was joined between the Turks and the Pechenegs who were at that time called 'Kangar’, the army of the Turks was defeated and split into two parts. One part went eastwards and settled in the region of Persia, and they to this day are called by the ancient denomination of the Turks 'Sabartoi

asphaloi’ ; but the other part, together with their voivode and chief Lebedias, settled in the western region, in places called Atelkouzou, in which places the nation of the Pechenegs now lives. A short while afterwards, that chaganprince of Chazaria sent a message to the Turks, requiring that Lebedias, their first voivode, should be sent to him. Lebedias, therefore, came to the cliagan of Chazaria and asked the reason why he had sent for him to come to him. The chagan said to him : «We have invited you upon this account, in order that, since you are noble and wise and valorous and first among the Turks, we may appoint you prince of your nation, and you may be obedient to our word and our command.» But he, in reply, made answer to the chagan: «Your regard and purpose for me I highly esteem and express to you suitable thanks, but since I am not strong enough for this rule, 1 cannot obey you ; on the other hand, however, there is a voivode other than me, called Almoutzis, and he has a son called Arpad ; let one of these, rather, either that Almoutzis or his son Arpad, be made prince, and be obedient to your word.» That chagan was pleased at this saying, and gave some of his men to go with him, and sent them to the Turks, and after they had talked the matter over with the Turks, the Turks pre ferred that Arpad should be prince rather than Almoutzis his father, for he was of superior parts and greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour, and capable of this rule; and so they made him prince according to the custom, or 'zakanon’, of the Chazars, by lifting him upon a shield. Before this Arpad the Turks had never at any time had any other prince, and so even to this day the prince of Turkey is from his family. Some years later, the Pechenegs fell upon the Turks and drove them out with their prince Arpad. The Turks, in flight and seeking a land to dwell in, came and in their turn expelled the inhabitants of great Moravia and settled in their land, in which the Turks now live to this day. And since that time the Turks have not sustained any attack from the Pechenegs. To the afore said nation of the Turks that settled in the east, in the regions of Persia, these Turks aforesaid who live toward the western region still send mer

chants who look them up, and often bring them back official messages from them. The place of the Pechenegs, in which at that time the Turks lived, is called after the name of the local rivers. The rivers are these : the first river is that called Barouch, the second river that called Koubou, the third river that called Troullos, the fourth river that called Broutos, the fifth river that called Seretos.

The so-called Kabaroi were of the race of the Chazars. Now, it fell out that a secession was made by them to their government, and when a civil war broke out their first government prevailed, and some of them were slain, but others escaped and came and settled with the Turks in the land of the Pechenegs, and they made friends with one another, and were called 'Kabaroi’. And so to these Turks they taught also the tongue of the Chazars, and to this day they have this same language, but they have also the other tongue of the Turks. And because in wars they show themselves strongest and most valorous of the eight clans, and are leaders in war, they have been promoted to be first clans. There is one prince among them, I mean, among the three clans of the Kabaroi, who survives to this day.

Having thus combined with one another, the Kabaroi dwelt with the Turks in the land of the Pechenegs. After this, at the invitation

of Leo, the Christ-loving and glorious emperor, they crossed over and fought Symeon and totally defeated him, and drove on and penetrated as far as Preslav, having shut him up in the city called Moundraga ; and they went back to their own country. At that time they had Liountikas, son of Arpad, for their prince. But after Symeon was once more at peace with the emperor of the Romans and was free to act, he sent to the Pechenegs and made an agreement with them to attack and destroy of the Turks. And when the Turks had gone off on a military expedition, the Pechenegs with Symeon came against the Turks and completely destroyed their families and miserably expelled thence the Turks who were guarding their country. When the Turks came back and found their country thus desolate and utterly ruined, they settled in the land where they live to-day, which is called after the above name of the rivers, as has been said. The place in which the Turks used formerly to be is called after the name of the river that runs through it, Etel and Kouzou, and in it the Pechenegs live now. But the Turks, expelled by the Pechenegs, came and settled in the land which they now dwell in. In this place are various landmarks of the olden days : first, there is the bridge of the emperor Trajan, where Turkey begins ; then, a three days journey from this same bridge, there is Belgrade, in which is the tower of the holy and great Constantine, the emperor ; then, again, at the running back of the river, is the renowned Sirmium by name, a journey of two days from Belgrade ; and beyond lies great Moravia, the unbaptized, which the Turks have blotted out, but over which in former days Sphendoplokos used to rule. Such are the landmarks and names along the Danube river ; but the regions above these, which comprehend the whole settlement of Turkey, they now call after the names of the rivers that flow there.

Titza. Neighbours of the Turks are, on the eastern side the Bulgarians, where the river Istros, also called Danube, runs between them ; on the northern, the Pechenegs ; on the western, the Franks ; and on the southern, the Croats. These eight clans of the Turks do not obey their own particular princes, but have a joint agreement to fight together with all earnestness and zeal upon the rivers, wheresoever war breaks out. They have for their first chief the prince who comes by succession of Arpad’s family, and two others, the gylas and the karchas, who have the rank of judge ; and each clan has a prince. Gylas and karchas are not proper names, but dignities. Arpad, the great prince of Turkey, had four sons : first, Tarkatzous ; second, Ielech ; third, Ioutotzas ; fourth, Zaltas. The eldest son of Arpad, Tarkatzous, had a son Tebelis, and the second son Ielech had a son Ezelech, and the third son Ioutotzas had a son Phalitzis, the present prince, and the fourth son Zaltas had a son Taxis. All the sons of Arpad are dead, but his grandsons Phalis and Tasis and their cousin Taxis are living. Tebelis is dead, and it is his son Termatzous who came here recently as 'friend’ with Boultzous, third prince and karchas of Turkey. The karchas Boultzous is the son of the karchas Kalis, and Kalis is a proper name, but karchas is a dignity, like gylas, which is superior to karchas.

4L. Of t h e c o u n t r y of Mo r a v i a .
The prince of Moravia, Sphendoplokos, was valiant and terrible to the nations that were his neighbours. This same Sphendoplokos had three sons, and when he was dying he divided his country into three parts and left a share apiece to his three sons, leaving the eldest to be great prince and the other two to be under the command of the eldest son. He exhorted them not to fall out with one another, giving them this example by way of illustration : he brought three wands and bound them together and gave them to the first son to break them, and when he was not strong enough, handed them on to the second, and in like manner to the third, and then separated the three wands and gave one each to the three of them ; when they had taken them and were bidden to break them, they broke them through at once. By means of this illustration he exhorted them and said : «If you remain undivided in concord and love, you shall be unconquered by your adversaries and invincible ; but if strife and rivalry come among you and you divide yourselves into three governments, not subject to the eldest brother, you shall be both destroyed by one another and brought to utter ruin by the enemies who are your neighbours.» After the death of this same Sphendoplokos they remained at peace for a year, and then strife and rebellion fell upon them and they made a civil war against one another, and the Turks came and utterly ruined them and possessed their country, in which even now they live. And those of the fo’k who were left were scat tered and fled for refuge to the adjacent nations, to the Bulgarians and Turks and Croats and to the rest of the nations.

From Thessalonica to the river Danube where stands the city called Belgrade, is a journey of eight days, if one is not travelling in haste but by easy stages. The Turks live beyond the Danube river, in the land of Moravia, but also on this side of it, between the Danube and the Save river. From, the lower reaches of the Danube river, opposite to Distra, Patzinacia stretches along, and its inhabitants control the territory as far as Sarkéi, the city of the Chazars, in which garrisons of 300 men are posted and annu ally relieved. Sarkéi among them means 'white house’, and it was built by the spatharocandidate Petronas, surnamed Camaterus, when the Chazars requested the emperor Theophilus that this city should be built for them. For that famous chagan and the pech of Chazaria sent envoys to this same emperor Theophilus and begged that the city of Sarkéi might be built for them, and the emperor acceded to their request and sent to them the afore said spatharocandidate Petronas with ships of war of the imperial navy, and sent also ships of war of the captain-general of Paphlagonia. This same Petronas arrived at Cherson and left the ships of war at Cherson, and,

having embarked his men on ships of burden, went off to that place on the Tanais river where he was to build the city. And since the place had no stones suitable for the building of the city, he made some ovens and baked bricks in them and with these he carried out the building of the city, making mortar out of shingle from the river. Now this aforesaid spatharocandidate Petronas, after building the city of Sarkéi, went to the emperor Theophilus and said to him : «If you wish complete mastery and dominion over the city of Cherson and of the places in Cherson, and not that they should slip out of your hand, appoint your own military governor and do not trust to their primates and nobles.» For up till the time of Theophilus the emperor, there was no military governor sent from here, but all administration was in the hands of the so-called primate, with those who were called the fathers of the city. The emperor Theophilus took counsel in this matter, whether to send as military governor so-and-so or such-an-one, and at last made up his mind that the aforesaid spatharocandidate Petronas should be sent, as one who had acquired local experience and was not unskilled in affairs, and so he promoted him to be protospatharius and appointed him military governor and sent him out to Cherson, with orders that the then primate and everyone else were to obey him ; and from that time until this day it has been the rule for military governors in Cherson to be appointed from here. So much, then, for the building of the city of Sarkéi. From the Danube river to the aforesaid city of Sarkéi is a journey of 60 days. In this land between are many rivers : the two biggest of them are the Dniester and the Dnieper. But there are other rivers, that which is called the Syngoul and the Hybyl and the Almatai and the Kouphis and the Bogou and many others. On the higher reaches of the Dnieper river live the Russians, and down this river they sail and arrive at the Romans. Patzinacia possesses all the land as jar as Russia and Bosporus and as far as Cherson and up to Sarat, Bourat and the rest of the Regions. The distance along the sea-coast from the Danube river to the Dniester river is 120 miles. From the Dniester river to the river Dnieper is 80 miles, the so-called 'gold coast’. After the

mouth of the river Dnieper comes Adara, and there is a great gulf, called Nekropyla, where it is utterly impossible for a man to pass through. From the Dnieper river to Cherson is 300 miles, and between are marshes and harbours, in which the Chersonites manufacture salt. Between Cherson and Bosporus are the cities of the Regions, and the distance is 300 miles. After Bosporus comes the mouth of the Maeotie lake, which for its size everybody calls a sea. Into this same Maeotie sea run rivers many and great; on its northern side runs the Dnieper river, from which the Russians come through to black Bulgaria and Chazaria and Syria. This same gulf of Maeotis comes opposite to, and within about four miles of, the Nekropyla that are near the Dnieper river, and joins them where the ancients dug a ditch and carried the sea through, enclosing within all the land of Cherson and of the Regions and the land of Bosporus, which cover up to 1,000 miles or even rather more. In the course of many years this same ditch has silted up and become a great forest, and there are in it but two roads, along which the Pechenegs pass through to Cherson and Bosporus and the Regions. Into the eastern side of the Maeotie lake debouch many rivers, the Tanais river that comes down from the city of Sarkéi, and the Charakoul, in which they fish for sturgeon, and there are other rivers, the Bal and the Bourlik, the Chadir and other rivers very numerous. From the Maeotie lake debouches a mouth called Bourlik and flows down into the sea of Pontus where Bosporus is, and opposite to Bosporus is the city called Tamatarcha ; the width of the strait of this mouth is 18 miles. In the middle of these 18 miles is a large, low island, called Atech. After Tamatarcha, some 18 or 20 miles from it, is a river called Oukrouch, which divides Zichia and Tamatarcha, and from the Oukrouch to the Nikopsis river, on which stands a city with the same name as the river, is the country of Zichia; the distance is 300 miles. Beyond Zichia is the country called Papagia, and beyond the country of Papagia is the country called Kasachia, and beyond Kasachia are the Caucasian mountains, and beyond the mountains is the country of Alania. Off the sea board of Zichia lie islands, the great island and the three islands ; and, closer to shore than these, are yet other islands, which have been used for pasturage

But concerning the northern Scyths sufficient has been made plain to you, beloved child, knowledge of which shall be all ways advantageous and useful to you in time of need ; but also it is right that you should not be ignorant of the parts towards the rising sun, for what reasons they became once more subject to the Romans, after they had first fallen away from their control. That famous Krikorikios, then, prince of Taron, at first bent and submitted himself before the emperor of the Romans, but from the first he seemed double-faced, and while in word he pretended to esteem the friendship of the emperor, in fact he acted at the pleasure of the chief prince of the Saracens, and on various occasions led armies that came out of Syria against provinces subject to the emperor of the Romans, and everything that the Romans were planning in secret against their Saracen adversaries he would divulge to Syria, and would always keep the commander of the faithful informed secretly through his letters of what was going on among us ; and while he wished to appear a partisan of the Roman cause, he was found, on the contrary, to prefer and esteem the cause of the Saracens. However, he continually sent presents, such as appear valuable to the barbarians of those parts, to Leo, the glorious among emperors, and got in return more and better from the pious emperor, who also frequently urged him by letter to visit the imperial city and behold the emperor and partake of the bounties and honours bestowed by him. But he, fearing lest this might vex and offend the commander of the faithful, would trump up excuses, and falsely allege that it was impossible for him to leave his own country deprived of his assistance, lest it might be plundered by the Saracens. Now, this same prince of Taron one day captured in battle the sons of Arka'ikas, that is to say, the cousins of the patrician Krikorikios, father

of the protospatharius Asotios, and he held them by him as prisoners. On their behalf the then prince of princes Symbatios sent letters to the same emperor, of most blessed memory, begging him to send to the Taronite and make efforts to recover these nephews of his, the sons of the said Arkalkas, so that they might not be sent to the commander of the faithful; for the patrician Grigorios was a relative of Symbatios, the prince of princes. The emperor Leo, of most blessed memory, acceded to this request ofSymbatios, and sent the wellknown eunuch Sinoutis, who was then chief clerk to the foreign ministry, to the prince of Taron upon this business, and also to Adranasir, the curopalate of Iberia, on some other matters of business ; and he furnished him with presents suitable to both. But when a calumnious charge was laid before the said glorious emperor against the said Sinoutis by Theodore, the Arme nian interpreter, there was sent out as imperial agent in his stead the proto spatharius Constantine Lips, keeper of the imperial plate, — he who is now patrician proconsul and commander of the great company, — with orders instructing him to take over the presents dispatched to the prince -of Taron, Krikorikios, and himself to proceed to Taron, and to order Sinoutis to go on to Adranasir, the curopalate of Iberia, as he had been ordered to do. The said protospatharius arrived at Taron and gave to Krikorikios the gifts and letters of the emperor which had been sent to him, and took up the bastard son of the Taronite, who was called Asotios, and brought him to the imperial city ; and the emperor honoured him with the rank of proto spatharius and richly entertained him, and then sent him back to his father in the conduct of the same protospatharius. The same Constantine took thence Apoganem, brother of Krikorikios, prince of Taron, and brought him to the emperor, of blessed memory, together with the two sons ofArka'ikas; and him too the emperor honoured with the rank of protospatharius and many times bounteously entertained him, and sent him back again, in conduct of the same Constantine, to his country and his brother. After this the said Constantine spent some time in Chaldia, and was then commissioned by imperial mandate to go to Taron and take Krikorikios, prince of Taron, and come to the imperial city ; and this he did. When this same Krikorikios had entered the city protected of God, and had been honoured with the rank of magister and military governor of Taron, he was also given for his residence a house called the house of Barbaros, now the house of Basil the chamberlain. He was, moreover, honoured with an annual stipend of ten pounds in gold and a further ten pounds in miliaresia,V

making twenty pounds in all. After some sojourn in the imperial city, he was escorted back again to his country by this same protospatharius Constantine. After this, Apoganem came once more to the emperor, of blessed memory, and was advanced by him to the rank of patrician ; and he was also permitted to take to wife the daughter of the said Constantine, and on this ground he asked for a house as well and he too received the house of Barbaros, without a golden bull. After receiving the emperor’s bounty, he then returned to his country, with intent to come again and complete the celebration of his marriage ; but no sooner was he escorted back to his country than he ended his life, a few days afterwards. His brother Krikorikios sent letters asking that he might come to the imperial city and receive from the hands of the holy emperor the stipend granted to him and sojourn for some while in the city protected of God. Thereupon he proceeded to demand for his residence the house which had been set aside for his brother, and the emperor, ofblessed memory, handed it over to him, both because he had lately submitted himself and in order to excite in other princes of the east a similar eagerness for submission to the Romans ; but he issued no golden bull making a deed of gift of this house to him. Several years later, when the emperor Romanus, of blessed memory, had laid hold upon the sceptre of the empire of the Romans, this same Krikorikios reported that he had not the means to keep the house of Barbaros, but deman ded that he should receive in its stead a suburban estate in Keltzini, either that of Tatzatos or some other, whichever the emperor directed, in order that, when the Agarenes should make an incursion into his country, he might be able to send thither his personal relatives and substance. The emperor, who did not possess an accurate knowledge of the facts, and supposed that the Taronite held the house of Barbaros in virtue of an imperial golden bull of Leo, of blessed memory, gave him the suburban estate of Grigoras in Keltzini and, of course, took back the house ; but he too issued no golden bull in his favour in respect of the suburban estate. Thereupon Tornikis, nephew of the Taronite and son of that Apoganem, wrote to this same emperor : «The house of Barbaros was presented to my father by the emperor Leo, of most blessed memory, but after my father’s death, because I was not yet of age and an orphan, my uncle, in virtue of his authority, took possession of his house, always promising me that when I should come of age, I should take over the paternal house ; and now, as I have

learned, my uncle has given this house to your imperial majesty, and has received in exchange for it the suburban estate of Grigoras in Keltzini.» And because of these imperial gifts bestowed on the prince of Taron, envy towards him was implanted and grew up in Kakikios, prince of Basparaka, and Adranasir, the curopalate of Iberia, and Asotikios, the prince of princes, who wrote to the emperor grumbling at the cause whereby the Taronite alone enjoyed an imperial stipend, while all of them got nothing. «For what service — they said — is he performing more than we, or in what does he help the Romans more than we do? Either, therefore, we too should he stipendiary as he is, or else he too should be excluded from this largess.» The emperor Romanus, of blessed memory, wrote back to them, that the stipend in favour of the Taronite had not been granted by him, that it should now lie with him to cut it off, but by the emperor, of most blessed memory; nor was it just that what had been done by former emperors should be undone by their successors. However, he wrote to this same Taronite inform ing him that the said parties were vexed and offended. He replied that he could provide neither gold nor silver, but promised to give, over and above the gifts regularly sent, tunics and bronze vessels up to ten pounds in total value, and these he did give for three or four years. But thereafter he reported that he could not provide this tribute, and demanded that he should receive the stipend or dower as in the time of the emperor Leo, of most blessed memory, or else that it should be cut off. And so, that it might not cause offence to Kakikios and the curopalate and the rest, the said emperor Romanus, of blessed memory, cut it off. But to console him, as it were, he afterwards honoured his son Asotios, when he came to Constantinople, with patrician rank and entertained him munificently before sending him home. On the death of the magister Krikorikios, Tornikios, son of Apoganem, reported that he heartily desired to come and behold the emperor; whereupon the emperor sent the protospatbarius Krinitis, the interpreter, who brought the said Tornikios to Constantinople, and the emperor advanced the same Tornikios to the honour of patrician rank. He put forward his claims to the house of Barbaros, and, having heard that his uncle had resigned his ownership of it on receipt of a suburban estate in Keltzini, declared that his uncle had no power to effect an exchange in respect of his paternal inheritance, and demanded that he should be given either the house or the suburban estate, failing which, he was for resigning both to the emperor, so that his cousins might not have them. Therefore the emperor, since

the old Taronite was now dead, resumed the suburban estate but did not give the house in exchange for it, because, as has already been stated above, no golden bull had been issued in respect of any of these transactions. After this, the well-known Pankratios, eldest son of that magister Krikorikios the Taronite, came tothe imperial city and was advanced by the emperor to the dignity ofpatrician and was also made military governor of Taron. He asked that he might also be given a wife from among the ladies related to the imperial family, and the emperor gave him to wife the sister of the magister Theophylact. And after his marriage he made a will, in which he stated : «If children are born to me of this woman, they are to have all my country for their ancestral inheritance.» Thereupon he asked the emperor that he might be given the suburban estate of Grigoras for the patrician lady, his wife, toreside there, and after her death this suburban estate should revert tohis imperial majesty. The emperor sanctioned this too, and after presenting him with many gifts, sent him with his wife away to his country. Now, the sons of the magister Krikorikios, this same patrician Pankratios and the patrician Asotios, greatly vexed and oppressed their cousin, the patrician Tornikios, who, finding their aggressiveness unendurable, wrote to the emperor to send a trustworthy servant and take over his country, and conduct himself and his wife and their child to the emperor. The emperor sent the protospatharius Krinitis, the interpreter, to take him and conduct him to the city protected of God, in accordance with his demand. But when Krinitis arrived in that country, he found that Tornikios had already departed this life, having devised before his end that all his country should be subject to the emperor of the Romans, and that his wife and his child should go to the emperor ; and to her, on her arrival, the emperor gave for her residence the monastery in Psomathia of the protospatharius Michael, formerly collector of Chaldia. The said Krinitis was sent back again by the emperor to take over the country of Apoganem, that is, the portion of the patrician Tornikios. But the sons of the Taronite, the cousins of the deceased, sent back thence a demand that they should give up Oulnoutin and retain the country of their cousin, for they were quite unable to live if the emperor were to occupy their cousin’s country as his own. The emperor, yielding to his own goodness of heart, fulfilled their request and gave them the country of Apoganem, their cousin, and himself took Oulnoutin with all its surrounding territory.

Before the time of Asotios, prince of princes, father of Symbatios, prince of princes, whom the emir of Persia Aposatai beheaded and who had two sons, Asotios, who was prince of princes after him, and Apasakios, who was afterwards honoured with the rank of magister, these three cities, Perkri and Chaliat and Arzes, were under the control of Persia. The prince of princes had his seat in great Armenia, at the city of Kars, and held both these three cities aforementioned, Perkri and Chaliat and Arzes, and also Tibi and Chert and Salamas. Apelbart possessed Manzikiert, and was beneath the dominion of Asotio , the prince of princes, the father of Symbatios, the prince of princes. The same Asotios, prince of princes, gave to this same Apelbart also the city of Chliat and Arzes and Perkri: for the aforesaid Asotios, prince of princes, father of Symbatios, prince of princes, held all the countries of the east. On the death of Apelbart his son Abelchamit possessed his domain, and on the death of Abelchamit his eldest son Aposebatas possessed his domain. He, after the murder of Symbatios, prince of princes, by Aposatai, the emir of Persia, took possession, in absolute sovereignty, as an independent potentate, both of the city of Manzikiert and of the rest of the cities and the countries ; and he submitted himself to the emperor together with his other two brothers, Apolesphouet and Aposelmis, after their cities and their countries had on various occasions been over-run and ravaged and destroyed by the commander-in-chief, and they paid the emperor of the Romans tribute in respect of their cities and their territories.

Moreover, the city of Manzikiert with the country of \pachounis and Kori and Gharka was under the dominion and control of the same prince of princes, up till the time when Aposebatas, emir of Manzikiert, and his two brothers Apolesphouet and Aposelmis submitted themselves to the emperor and paid tribute in respect of their cities and their territories ; and since the prince of princes is the servant of the emperor if the Romans, being appointed by him and receiving this dignity from dim, it is obvious that the cities and townships and territories of which de is lord also belong to the emperor of the Romans. When Symbatios, prince of princes of great Armenia, was captured by Aposatai, the emir of Persia, and by him beheaded, Aposebatas, with bis seat at the city of Manzikiert, took possession of the city of Chaliat md the city of Perkri and the township of Arzes. The second brother of Aposebatas, Apolesphouet, and his nephew and step-son Achmet took possession of the city of Chliat and the city of Arzes and the city of Altzike, and they too submitted themselves to the emperor of the Romans and came beneath his dominion and paid tribute in respect of their cities and their territories, as did the eldest brother Aposebatas. The third brother of Aposebatas and Apolesphouet, Aposelmis, was in possession of the city of Tzermatzou with its territories, and he too submitted himself to the emperor of the Romans and paid tribute, as did his eldest brother Aposebatas and his second brother Apolesphouet.

lountries aforesaid, and on his death the third brother, that is, the brother )f Aposebatas and Apolesphouet, Aposelmis, possessed Manzikiert and all ;he countries aforesaid. Aposebatas had a son Abderacheim, and another, Apelmouze. Apolesphouet had a step-son and nephew, Achamet, for he had no son, but had instead of a son Achamet, his step-son and nephew. Aposelmis had a son Apelbart, who now possesses Manzikiert. On the death of Aposebatas, he left Abderacheim his son to be emir, aut his other son, Apelmouze, was a mere infant, and hence was passed 3ver as unfit to enter into the authority of his father and brother. Aposebatas, the eldest brother, had his seat at the city of Manzikiert and possessed, as has been said, these countries, Apachounis and Kori and Charka, and paid tribute in respect of them to the emperor of the Romans ; and on his death his son Abderacheim ruled, and he too paid the aforesaid tribute, his brother Apelmouze being, as was said above, quite an infant. On the death of Abderacheim, since his brother Apelmouze was passed aver as an infant, the possession of the city of Manzikiert and of the aforesaid countries beneath it fell to the second brother of Aposebatas, the aforesaid Apolesphouet, uncle of Abderacheim and of his brother Apelmouze, who had been passed over because of his infancy. On the death of Apolesphouet, the third brother of Aposebatas, that is, Aposelmis, took possession of the city of Manzikiert with the territories aforesaid. The aforesaid Achamet, who was nephew and step-son of Apoles phouet, took possession, by consent and will of Apolesphouet, of Chliat and Arzes and Perkri: for Apolesphouet, having, as was said above, no son, made Achamet, his nephew and step-son, heir of all his substance and of his cities and territories. On the death of Aposelmis, his son Apelbart possessed the city of Manzikiert with its surrounding territory. But Achmet possessed the three cities, the city of Chliat and the city of Arzes and the city of Altzike. This Achmet too was servant of the emperor, as has been said above,

All these cities aforesaid and the aforesaid countries have never been leneath the dominion of Persia or beneath the dominion of the commander f the faithful, but were, as has been said, in the days of the lord Leo, the mperor, beneath the dominion of Symbatios, the prince of princes, and fterwards came beneath the dominion of the three brothers, the aforesaid mirs, Aposebatas and Apolesphouet and Aposelmis; and in their days srere brought into servitude and made tributary and fell beneath the lominion of the emperors of the Romans. If these three cities, Chliat and Arzes and Perkri, are in the possession >f the emperor, a Persian army cannot come out against Romania, because hey are between Romania and Armenia, and serve as a barrier and as lilitary halts for armies.

The Iberians, I mean, those who belong to the curopalate, pique .hemselves upon their descent from the wife of Uriah, with whom David, .he prophet and king, committed adultery : for they say they are descended rorn the children she bore to David and are related to David, the prophet ind king, and consequently to the most holy Mother of God also, inasmuch is she was by descent of the seed of David. For this reason also the great )nes of the Iberians take in marriage their female relatives without mpediment, believing that they are preserving the ancient ordinance ; and ihey say that they originate from Jerusalem and were warned by an oracular iream to migrate thence and to settle over toward the region of Persia, that is to say, in the country where they live now. They who were warned by the oracle and came out of Jerusalem were the famous David and his brother Spandiatis, which Spandiatis had received from God a boon, as they pretend, that in battle the sword should not touch him in any member of

Is body save only in the heart, which he used to protect by a sort of covering a battles. On this account the Persians were dismayed at and feared him, nd he overcame them and mastered them and settled his Iberian kinsmen a the difficult territories now possessed by them ; whence by degrees they xpanded and increased and grew into a great nation. Thereafter, when he emperor Heraclius marched against Persia, they united and campaigned /ith him, and as a result, through the dread inspired by Heraclius, emperor f the Romans, rather than by their own strength and power, they subdued . great number of cities and countries of the Persians. For once the emperor leraclius had routed the Persians and had forcibly brought their empire o an end, the Persians were easily defeated and mastered, not by the Iberians mly, but by the Saracens as well. And because they originated, as they hemselves say, from Jerusalem, for this reason they are very loyal to it ind to the sepulchre of our Lord J esus Christ, and from time to time they send arge sums of money to the patriarch of the holy city and to the Christians here. Now, the aforesaid David, the brother of Spandiatis, begat a son Jankratios, and Pankratios begat a son Asotios, and Asotios begat a son Vdranasi, who was honoured with the rank of curopalate by Leo, the Christoving emperor of the Romans. But Spandiatis, the brother of the aforesaid David, died childless. And from their migration from Jerusalem to the ;ountry now inhabited by them it is 400 years, or rather 500 up to the »resent day, which is the 10th indiction, the year from the creation of the vorld 6460, in the reign of Constantine and Romanus, Christ-loving emperors »f the Romans, born in the purple. The Christ-loving and glorious emperor Leo, born in the purple, tearing that the Saracens had arrived in the place called Phasiane and had nade the churches there into fortresses, sent the patrician Lalakon, military governor of the Armeniakoi, together with the military governor of Koloneia ind the military governor of Mesopotamia and the military governor of ^haldia, and they destroyed these fortresses and liberated the churches and •avaged all Phasiane, at that time in the possession of the Saracens. And »gain afterwards he sent the magister Katakalon, the commander-in-chief, vho arrived at the city of Theodosioupolis and ravaged the territory all »bout it, and gave up the country of Phasiane and the cities around it to the

like destruction, and returned after inflicting thereby a great blow upon the Saracens. And in the reign of the lord Romanus, the emperor, the magister John Kourkouas, marching against the city of Tibi, utterly devastated in his passage the whole country of Phasiane, since it was in the possession of the Saracens. Moreover, the patrician Theophilus also, brother of the aforesaid magister John, when he was for the first time military governor of Ghaldia, plundered this country of Phasiane, because then too it was controlled by the Saracens. For by the time that terms had been agreed with the Theodosioupolitans, no village had been left standing in the country of Phasiane, or about the city of Abnikon either. And the Iberians always maintained loving and friendly relations with the men of Theodosioupolis and Abnikon and Manzikiert and with all Persia, but in Phasiane they never acquired any territories. The lord Leo, the emperor, and the lord Romanus and our own imperial majesty several times asked for the city of Ketzeon, so that we might take it over and introduce garrisons, in order to stop Theodosioupolis from being revictualled thence, assuring the curopalate and his brothers that after Theodosioupolis had been taken, they should have this city back ; but the Iberians did not consent to do this, out of their love for the Theodosiou politans and in order that the city of Theodosioupolis might not be taken, and declared in answer to the lord Romanus and to our imperial majesty, saying : «If we do this, we shall become dishonoured in the eyes of our neighbours, such as the magister the ruler of Abasgia and the Basparakanite and the potentates of the Armenians, and they will say that 'the emperor holds the Iberians, the curopalate and his brothers, for faithless and does not trust them, and that is why he has taken over the city from them’ ; but let the emperor rather send a lieutenant-general or some imperial agent, and let him take up his quarters in the city of Ketzeon and let him watch.» And they were instructed by imperial mandate, to this effect: «What is the use of our sending either lieutenant-general or imperial agent? Even if he enters, whether he be lieutenant-general or imperial agent, he will enter with ten or a dozen men and will take up his quarters in the lodgings which you will provide for him ; and since the roads leading to the city of Theo dosioupolis are many, he cannot from the city see the caravans entering the city of Theodosioupolis ; and caravans may enter Theodosioupolis by night, and they none the wiser.» And so, then, because the Iberians did not wish that Theodosioupolis should be taken, but rather that it should be

krevictualled, for this reason they did not obey and give up the city of Ketzeon, although they received a sworn promise in writing that after the capture of Theodosioupolis this city should revert to them. The Iberians never consented to raid or take prisoners in the environs of the city of Theodosioupolis or in its territories, or in the city of Abnikion or the territories about it, or in the city of Manzikiert or the area controlled by it. Whereas regarding the territories of Phasiane the curopalate persists in his demand for all Phasiane and the city of Abnikon, and alleges that he has golden bulls of the emperor the lord Romanus, of blessed memory, and of our imperial majesty, copies of which he sent us by the hand of Zourbanelis the protospatharius, his 'azat’, we examined these and found that they gave him no help. For, first, the golden bull of our father-in-law embodies a promise of this same curopalate, as he assured him on his oath and in scribed it with his own hand, that he will abide in loyalty to our imperial majesty, and fight against our foes and protect our friends, and subdue the east to our imperial majesty, and reduce cities and do great works for our comfort; and on the part of our father-in-law a promise was made to him that, if he continues in this loyal servitude and gratitude, he shall remain unshaken, both he and those of his family, in his rule and dominion ; and the emperor will not move the boundaries of his territories, but will be content with the agreements made by former emperors and will not push beyond them ; nor will he stop the curopalate from destroying Theodosioupolis and the rest of the cities of the enemy, whether he lays siege to them with his own unaided strength or with the assistance of this our army. Such are the main points contained in the golden bulls, and from them the curo palate gets no help : for that of our father-in-law lays it down that we will not disturb him from the ancient boundaries of his country, and that, if he can, whether by himself or with our army, he shall lay siege to and destroy Theodosioupolis and the rest of the cities of the enemy, but not so as to hold them in absolute sovereignty and lordship ; while that of our own imperial majesty includes a provision that all the places of the Agarenes which both he and his nephew, the magister Adranase, may be able by their own power to reduce, or shall in future reduce, he shall hold as sovereign lord. And since by his own power he subdued neither Theodosioupolis nor

Abnikon nor Mastaton, he has no right to hold them, lying as they do on this side of the Erax or Phasis river ; because the city of Annikon, on the one hand, has hitherto been independent and self-governing, under its own emir, and several times the army of our imperial majesty has raided it, yes, and the protospatharius John Arrhabonitis, the military governor, and the patrician Theophilus, who is now military governor of Theodosioupolis, and the rest of the military governors have taken great plunder and many prisoners in it, and burnt its villages, while the curopalate has never raided it at all. And when these villages had been utterly devastated by our imperial majesty, the Iberians crept in and took possession of them, and tried thereafter to possess themselves of the city. But the emir, after being several times warned by the patrician and military governor Theophilus, and see ing that he had no hope of livelihood from any quarter, submitted him self and consented to become the servant of our imperial majesty, and gave his son as a hostage. Mastaton, on the other hand, belonged to the Theodosioupolitans ; and when the magister John had besieged Theodosioupolis 'seven months, because he was unable to take it he sent some men and took this same city of Mastaton and introduced into it the protospatharius Petronas Boilas, who was then captain-general of Nicopolis. And the magi ster Pankratios, who had joined the campaign of this same magister at Theodosioupolis, when the latter was about to retire, begged him to give him this city, and made him an oath in writing that he would retain it and never give it up to the Saracens. He, as the said Pankratios was a Christian and servant of our imperial majesty, trusted to his oath and gave it him, and he gave it back again to the Theodosioupolitans. And when Theo dosioupolis was taken, the Iberians crept in and took possession of Mastaton; for these reasons they have no authority to demand either this city of Mastaton or that of Abnikon. But since the curopalate is our faithful and upright servant and friend, at his request let the frontier of Phasiane be the river Erax or Phasis, and let the Iberians possess the parts on the left hand side towards Illyria, and all the parts on the right towards Theodosioupolis, whether cities or villages, be beneath our imperial majesty, the river, that is to say, forming the frontier between the two, just as in his lifetime John Kourkouas, of blessed memory, when asked about this, declared that it was best for the river to be the frontier. Strict justice does not allow the curopalate any authority to exercise control either on this side of the river or on the other, since all these villages of the Theodosioupolitans were enslaved and

burnt by the armies of our imperial majesty, and never without our army did the Iberians come out and raid Theodosioupolis, but always maintained friendship with them and traded with them ; and while they said they wished Theodosioupolis to be taken, in their hearts they by no means desired its capture. However, our imperial majesty, for our love of the curopalate, as has been said, has consented that the river Erax, or Phasis, shall be the frontier between the two, and they must be content with retaining this much, and demand nothing more.

Pankratios and David the Mampalis, which means 'all-holy’, were sons of the great Symbatios the Iberian. Ardanoutzi fell to the inheritance of Pankratios, and other country fell to David. Pankratios had three sons, Adranaser, Kourkenios and the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, and he divided his country among them, and Ardanoutzi fell to his son Kourkenios, who, dying childless, left it to his brother Asotios, called Kiskasis. The patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, married his daughter to the well-known magister Kourkenis, who, having grown great, revolted, and deprived his fat her-in-law Asotios of Ardanoutzi, and gave him in exchange Tyrokastron and the river region of Atzaras, which forms the frontier of Romania at Kolorin. Now, the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, had to wife the sister of the magister George, ruler of Abasgia. And when the magister Kourkenios and the magister George, ruler of Abasgia, fell out with one another, the patrician Asotios took the side of the ruler of Abasgia, and for that reason Kourkenios, gaining the upper hand, deprived him even of what he had given him in exchange for Ardanoutzi, and expelled him, and he departed to Abasgia. On the death of the magister Kourkenios, Ardanoutzi was left to his wife, the daughter of the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, as her father’s heiress. Now when Asotios the curopalate and the magister George, ruler of Abasgia, and the magister Pankratios, brother of the aforesaid curopalate, were dividing up the country of the magister Kourkenios by

force of arms, they came to an accommodation and each took what was next to him. And Ardanoutzi lay next to Symbatios, son of the aforesaid David. Then all of them seized of the widow of the magister Kourkenios, that is, the daughter of the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, and said to her : «You, as a woman, cannot possess the city.» Then Symbatios gave the widow territories in exchange for the city, and took the city of Ardanoutzin. These Iberians are related to one another in the following manner. The mother of David and the mother of Adranase the curopalate, father of the present curopalate Asotios, were the children of two brothers, that is to say, they were first cousins. Symbatios, the son of David, had to wife the daughter of the magister Pankratios, father of Adranasi who is now magister, and after her death Adranasi married the sister of Symbatios, son of David. The city of Ardanoutzin is very strongly defended, and has moreover a considerable suburban area like a provincial city, and the commerce of Trapezus and of Iberia and of Abasgia and from the whole country of Armenia and Syria comes to it, and it has an enormous customs revenue from this commerce. The country of the city of Ardanoutzin, the 'Arzyn’, is both extensive and fertile, and it is a key of Iberia and Abasgia and of the Mischians. The emperor the lord Romanus, of blessed memory, sent the patrician Constantine, the lord admiral, who war at that time protospatharius and lictor, with a tunic of the magistracy in order to make Kourkenios the Iberian a ma gister. When the patrician Constantine, the lord admiral, had reached Nicomedeia,the monk Agapios of Kyminas came on the scene, who had at that time been visiting the holy city to fulfil a vow. In his passage through Iberia he had come to the city of Ardanoutzin. The patrician Asotios, called Kis kasis, at feud with his son-in-law Kourkenios, had spoken thus to the monk Agapios : «I adjure you, by God and by the power of the honourable and life-giving Cross, to go to Constantinople and tell the emperor to send and take over my city, and have it beneath his dominion.» The monk Agapios came to Constantinople and related to the emperor all that the patrician

Asotios, called Kiskasis, had said to him. The aforesaid patrician Constantine, the lord admiral, who was at Nicomedeia on the aforesaid business of appoint ing Kourkenios the Iberian to be magister, received by command of the emperor a missive of the patrician Symeon, the chief of the imperial chan cellery, which said : «Our holy emperor commands that you leave all you are engaged upon and go in haste to the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, and take over his city of Ardanoutzin, since he has declared to our holy emperor, by the mouth of the monk Agapios, that a trustworthy and familiar servant should be sent to take over his city of Ardanoutzin ; go, then, to Chaldia and take some capable officers, whom you know to be brave and trustworthy, and enter and take possession of this city.» The patrician Constantine, the lord admiral, went to Chaldia and took capable lieutenantgenerals and officers and men to the number of 300, and entered Iberia and fell into the hands of David, of blessed memory, brother of Asotios who is now curopalate, who said to him : «Whither have you been sent by the emperor and what task are you to perform, that you bring so many men along with you?» For they suspected that, now Adranase the curopalate was dead, the emperor must be about to honour Kourkenios with the rank of curopalate ; because, in the mean time, the sons of the curopalate Adranase had, after their father’s death, had certain quarrels with their cousin. And since Kourkenios had dispatched his chief man with a large gift to the emperor, requesting that he might be made curopalate or magister, the four brothers, that is, the sons of Adranase the curopalate, assumed that the patrician Constantine came thither to create Kourkenios curopalate. But the patrician Constantine put them off by saying: «Because I am about to honour Kourkenios with the rank of magister I bring with me so many men.» And the patrician Constantine went off to the country of Kourkenios and honoured him with the rank of magister, and, bidding him farewell, said: «I am going to David the magister.» For this same patrician Constantine had for David also a mandate and presents from the emperor. And he entered Ardanoutzin, the city of the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, and gave him the imperial mandate addressed to him, which contained nothing about the city of Ardanoutzin, but was about other matters.

the patrician Constantine said to him : «Although the mandate contains nothing about the city of Ardanoutzin, none the less the monk Agapios came to the emperor and reported to him all that you had bidden him about the city of Ardanoutzin, and therefore the emperor has sent me, to take over the city and introduce into it the men I bring along with me.» And since, as has been said above, the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, was at feud with his son-in-law Kourkenios, he had made up his mind the rather to give his city to the emperor. The patrician Constantine had with him standards and he gave one to the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis. He put it upon a pike and gave it to the patrician Constantine, saying : «Set it up on top of the wall, that all may know that from this day this city belongs to the emperor.» The patrician Constantine did so and set the standard on top of the wall and made the customary salutations of the emperors of the Romans, so that it became known to all that the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, had made a present of the city of Ardanoutzin to the emperor. Now, the great David made no offer of his country to the emperor, not withstanding it marched with the county of Akampsis and with Mourgouli. So then the patrician Constantine reported to the emperor in two dispatches, the one containing the news of how he had honoured Kourkenios with the rank of magister, and of how Kourkenios had accepted the magistracy and saluted the emperor; and the other containing news about the city of Ardanoutzin, and of how he had taken it over from the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, and that the patrician Asotios and his son-in-law the ma gister Kourkenios had a great quarrel and feud with one another, and that the emperor should send succour for the garrisoning of this city, and that, should it be possible, the commander-in-chief should also come. When the Iberians, the magister Kourkenios and the magister David, brother of the curopalate Asotios, saw what was done, they wrote to the emperor : «If your imperial majesty approves this and enters our country, then we put off our servitude to your imperial majesty and make common cause with the Saracens, since we shall have fighting and hostilities with the Romans and shall, perforce, move an army against the city of Ardanoutzin and its country, and against Romania itself.» The emperor, having learnt

bf these things through the letters of the aforesaid princes and having heard them from their envoys, and being terrified lest perchance they might make common cause with the Saracens and lead out the armies of Persia against Romania, denied it, saying : «I did not write to the protospatharius Constantine, the lictor, about this city and its country, telling him to take it over, but out of his own folly, so to say, he has done this.» So spoke the emperor in his desire to treat them with all reverence ; and this same protospatharius Constantine, the lictor, received a mandate couched in terms of insult and menace : «Who instructed you to do this? Come you, the rather, out of the city and take Asotios, son of the late Adranase the curopalate, and conduct him hither, so that we may honour him with his father’s rank of curopalate.» On receipt of these orders, the patrician Constantine abandoned the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis, in his city of Ardanoutzin, and himself took leave and departed to the great David and gave him the mandate which he had for him, and returned and entered Iberia and found, met together in one place, the magister Kourkenios #and the magister David, brother of Asotios the curopalate. And they began to quarrel with and to heap abuse upon the patrician Constantine, saying : «You are a sly and evil fellow in not revealing to us, concerning the city of Ardanoutzin, that you were about to take possession of it», and, «It is not the emperor’s policy to possess himself of it, for we ourselves reported to the emperor on this affair and have received a reply that the emperor knows nothing whatsoever about this affair, but that you have done this out of love of the patrician Asotios, called Kiskasis.» The patrician Constan tine made a reasonable defence to these charges, and took Asotios, son of Adranase the curopalate, and conducted him to Constantinople, and he was honoured by the emperor with the dignity of curopalate.
But what of events which have taken place at various times between the Romans and different nations? For it is worth while, my dearest son, that record of these things also should not escape you, in order that, should the same things come about on similar occasions, you may by fore knowledge find a ready remedy.

Í7. Of t h e m i g r a t i o n of t h e C y p r i o t s t h e s t o r y is as f o l l o w s .
When the island was captured by the Saracens and remained unnhabited seven years, and the archbishop John came with his folk to the rnperial city, a dispensation was made by the emperor Justinian in the íoly sixth synod that he, with his bishops and the folk of the island, should -ake over Cyzicus and should make his appointments whenever a bishopric ihould fall vacant, to the end that the authority and rights of Cyprus might lot be interrupted (for the emperor Justinian himself also was a Cypriot, is from the Cypriots of olden days the tale has persisted unto this day); ind so it was ordained in the holy sixth synod that the archbishop of Cyprus should appoint the president of Cyzicus, as it is recorded in the 39th jhapter of the same holy sixth synod. But after seven years, by Gpd’s will the emperor was moved to populate lyprus again, and he sent to the commander of the faithful of Bagdad three if the illustrious Cypriots, natives of the same island, called Phangoumeis, together with an imperial agent both intelligent and illustrious, and wrote ,0 the commander of the faithful asking him to dismiss the folk of the island if Cyprus that were in Syria to their own place. The commander of the faithful obeyed the emperor’s epistle, and sent illustrious Saracens to all the parts of Syria and gathered together all the Cypriots and carried them aver to their own place. And the emperor, for his part, sent an imperial agent and carried over those who had settled in Romania, that is, at Cyzicus and in the Kibyrrhaiote and Thrakesian provinces, and the island was populated.

Nicephorus was holding the sceptre of the Romans, and these Slavs srho were in the province of Peloponnesus decided to revolt, and first proceded to sack the dwellings of their neighbours, the Greeks, and gave them ip to rapine, and next they moved against the inhabitants of the city of Patras nd ravaged the plains before its wall and laid siege to itself, having with hem African Saracens also. And when a considerable time had gone by nd there began to be dearth of necessaries, both water and foodstuffs, mong those within the wall, they took counsel among themselves to come o terms of composition and to obtain promises of immunity and then to urrender the city to their yoke. And so, as the then military governor was at he extremity of the province in the city of Corinth, and it had been expected .pat he would come and defeat the nation of the Slavenes, since he had eceived early intelligence of their assault from his officers, the inhabitants f the city resolved that a scout should first be sent to the eastern side if the mountains and spy out and discover if the military governor were a fact coming, and they instructed and gave a signal to their envoy, that f he were to see the military governor coming, he should on his way back lip the standard, so they might know of the coming of the military governor, iut if not, to hold the standard erect, so they might for the future not xpect the military governor to come. So the scout went off and found that he military governor was not coming, and began to come back, holding he standard erect. But, as it pleased God through the intercession of the loly apostle Andrew, the horse slipped and the rider fell off and dipped he standard, and the inhabitants of the city, seeing the signal given and lelieving that the military governor was coming undoubtedly, opened the ;ates of the city and sallied forth bravely against the Slavenes ; and they aw the first-called apostle, revealed to their eyes, mounted upon a horse md charging upon the barbarians, yea, and he totally routed them and cattered them and drave them far off from the city and made them to flee, ^.nd the barbarians saw and were amazed and confounded at the violent issault upon them of the invincible and unconquerable warrior and captain ind marshal, the triumphant and victorious first-called apostle Andrew,

ind were thrown into disorder and shaken, and trembling gat hold upon ,hem and they fled for refuge in his most sacred temple. Now when the military governor arrived on the third day after the •out and learnt of the victory of the apostle, he reported to the emperor Vicephorus upon the onset of the Slavenes and the foraging and enslaving md destroying and the plundering and all the other horrors which in their incursion they had inflicted on the regions of Achaea ; and also upon the hege of many days and the sustained assault on the inhabitants of the jity ; and in like manner upon the visitation and aid in battle and the rout md the total victory won by the apostle, and how he had been seen revealed to their eyes charging upon and pursuing the rear of the foe and routing them, so that the barbarians themselves were aware that the apostle had visited us and was aiding us in the battle, and therefore had fled for refuge to his hallowed temple. The emperor, learning of these things, gave orders to this effect: «Since the rout and total victory were achieved by the apostle, t is our duty to render to him the whole expeditionary force of the foe and the booty and the spoils.» And he ordained that the foemen themselves, with all their families and relations and all who belonged to them, and all their property as well, should be set apart for the temple of the apostle in the metropolis of Patras, where the first-called and disciple of Christ had performed this exploit in the contest; and he issued a bull concerning these matters in that same metropolis. These things the older and more ancient narrated, handing them down in unwritten tradition to them who lived in the after time, so that, as the prophet says, the coming generation might know the miracle wrought through the intercession of the apostle, and might rise up and declare it to their sons, that they might not forget the benefits done by God through the intercession of the apostle. And from that time the Slavenes who were set apart in the metropolis have maintained like hostages the military governors and the imperial agents and all the envoys sent from foreign nations, and they have their own waiters and cooks and servants of all kinds who prepare foods for the table ; and the metropolis interferes in none of these matters, for the Slavenes themselves collect the necessary funds by apportionment and subscription among their body. And Leo, too, the ever-memorable and most wise emperor, issued a bull containing a detailed

The Slave of the province of Peloponnesus revolted in the days of the emperor Theophilus and his son Michael, and became independent, and plundered and enslaved and pillaged and burnt and stole. And in the reign of Michael, the son of Theophilus, the protospatharius Theoctistus, surnamed Bryennius, was sent as military governor to the province of Peloponnesus with a great power and force, viz., of Thracians and Macedonians and the rest of the western provinces, to war upon and subdue them. He subdued and mastered all the Slavs and other insubordinates of the province of Peloponnesus, and only the Ezeritai and the Milingoi were left, towards Lacedaemonia and Helos. And since there is there a great and very high mountain called Pentadaktylos, which runs like a neck a long distance out into the sea, and because the place is difficult, they settled upon the flanks of this same mountain, the Milingoi in one part, and in the other part the Ezeritai. The aforesaid protospatharius Theoctistus, the military governor of Peloponnesus, having succeded in reducing these too, fixed a tribute of 60 nomismata for the Milingoi, and of 300 nomismata for the Ezeritai, and this they used to pay while he was military governor, as this report of it is preserved to this day by the local inhabitants. But in the reign of the lord Romanus the emperor, the protospatharius John Proteuon, military governor in this same province, reported to the same lord Romanus concerning both Milingoi and Ezeritai, that they neither obeyed the military governor nor regarded the imperial mandate, but were practically independent and self-governing, and neither accepted a head man at the hand of the military governor, nor heeded orders for military service under him, nor consented to perform other public services^

While his report was on its way, it happened that the protospatharius Krinitis Arotras was appointed military governor in Peloponnesus, and when the report of the protospatharius John Proteuon, military governor of Peloponnesus, arrived and was read in the presence of the emperor, the lord Romanus, and was found to contain news of the revolt of the aforesaid Slavs and of their reluctant obedience, or, more properly, their disobedience to the imperial commands, this same protospatharius Krinitis was instructed, since they had gone so far in revolt and disobedience, to march against them and defeat and subdue and exterminate them. And so, beginning his war upon them in the month of March and burning down their crops and plunder ing all their land, he kept them to defence and resistance until the month of November, and then, seeing that they were being exterminated, they begged to negotiate for their submission and pardon for their past misdoings. And so the aforesaid protospatharius Krinitis, he military governor, fixed upon them tributes greater than they had been paying: upon the Milingoi 540 nomismata on top of the 60 nomismata which they had paid before, so that their total tribute was 600 nomismata, and upon the Ezeritai another 300 nomismata on top of the 300 nomismata they had paid before, so that their total tribute was 600 nomismata, which this same protospatharius Krinitis exacted and conveyed to the Treasury of the Bedchamber guarded of God. But when the protospatharius Krinitis was transferred to the province of Hellas and the protospatharius Bardas Platypodis was appointed military governor in Peloponnesus, and disorder and strife were aroused by this same protospatharius Bardas Platypodis and by protospatharii and officers who took his part, and they expelled the protospatharius Leo Agelastos from the province, and straight away the Slavesians made an attack upon this same province, then these same Slavs, both Milingoi and Ezeritai, sent to the lord Romanus, the emperor, requesting and praying that the increments to their tribute should be forgiven them, and that they should pay what they had paid before. And since, as has been said above, the Slavesians had entered the province of Peloponnesus, the emperor, fearing lest they might join forces with the Slavs and bring about the total de struction of this same province, issued for the latter a golden bull providing that they should pay as before, the Milingoi 60 nomismata, and the Ezeritai 300 nomismata. Such, then, is the cause of the increase of the tribute of the Milingoi and Ezeritai, and of its remission.

The inhabitants of the city of Mama are not of the race of the aforesaid Slavs, but of the ancient Romans, and even to this day they are called '’Hellenes’ by the local inhabitants, because in the very ancient times they were idolaters and worshippers of images after the fashion of the ancient Hellenes ; and they were baptized and became Christians in the reign of the glorious Basil. The place where they live is waterless and inaccessible, but bears the olive, whence their comfort is. This place is situated in a corner of Malea, that is, beyond Ezeros towards the coast. Seeing that they are perfectly submissive and accept a head man from the military governor, and heed and obey the commands of the military governor, they have paid from very ancient times a tribute of 400 nomismata. The province of Cappadocia was of old a county of the province of the Anatolikoi. The province of Kephallenia, or the Islands, was of old a county of the province of Lombardy, but became a province in the time of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign. The province of Calabria was of old a duchy of the province of Sicily. The province of Charsianon was of old a county of the province of the Armeniakoi. In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign, the following hundreds were transferred from the province of the Boukellarioi to the province of the Cappadocians, viz., the garrison of Bareta, the garrison of Balbadona, the garrison of Aspona and the garrison of Akarkous; and from the province of the Anatolikoi to the province of the Cappadocians were transferred the following hundreds, viz., the garrison of Eudokias, the garrison of Haghios Agapitos, the garrison of Aphrazeia ; and these seven hundreds, that is, the four of the Boukellarioi and three of the Anatolikoi, became one county, now called the Kommata. In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign, the following hundreds were transferred from the province of the Boukellarioi to the province of Charsianon, viz., the garrison of Myriokephalon, the garrison of Timios Stauros and the garrison of Berinoupolis, and they became the county now called Saniana. And from the province of the Armeniakoi to the province of Charsianon were transferred the following hundreds, viz., the garrison of Komodromos, the garrison of Tabia* and were added to the said county of Charsianon. From the province of the Cappadocians to the province of Charsianon the following hundreds were transferred, viz., the county of Kasi in toto and the garrison of Nyssa with Caesareia.

In past times the province of Chozanon was beneath the Saracens and in like manner the province of Asmosaton also was beneath the Saracens. Chanzit and Romanopolis were frontier passes of the Melitenians. And from the mountain of Phatilanon all beyond belonged to the Saracens ; Tekis belonged to Manuel. Kamacha was the extreme county of Kolonia, and the county of Keltzini was under Chaldia. Mesopotamia was not a province at that time. But Leo, the Christ-loving and ever-memorable emperor, brought that well-known Manuel out of Tekis upon a promise of immunity, and brought him to Constantinople and made him protospatharius. This same Manuel has four sons, Pankratoukas, Iachnoukas, Moudaphar and John. Pankratoukas the emperor made commander of the Hicanati and thereafter military governor of the Boukellarioi, and Iachnoukas he made military governor of Nicopolis, and to Moudaphar and John he gave crown land at Trapezus, and he honoured them all with dignites and con ferred on them many benefits. And he made Mesopotamia a province and appointed the well-known Orestes, the Charsianite, to be military governor .of it, and then gave the county of Kamacha to be under the province of Mesopotamia, and thereafter put the county of Keltzini also beneath the province of Mesopotamia. All these being now beneath the dominion of the Romans, in the time of the sovereign Romanus Romanopolis and Chanzit were added to the province of Mesopotamia. In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign, Larissa was a county of Sebasteia, and Kymbalaios was a county of Charsianon, and Symposion was a desert adjacent to the region of Lykandos. And in the reign of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign, Eustathius Argyrus was recalled from banish ment and appointed military governor of Charsianon, while Melias was still a refugee at Melitene, as was Baasakios with his two brothers Krikorikios and Pazounis, and also the well-known Ismael the Armenian ; these wrote to the emperor and to the aforesaid Argyrus, asking that they might receive a promise of immunity in form of a golden bull and might come out, and that Baasakios and his brothers might have their seat at Larissa and Baasa kios be named frontier warden of Larissa, which was done ; and that Ismael should be frontier warden of Symposion, which was done ; and that Melias should be made lieutenant-general of Euphrateia, of the Trypia, and of the Desert, and that was done. But since the Melitenians came out and did away

vith that Ismael, Symposion remained deserted. And when Baasakios was accused of plotting treachery and exiled, Larissa became once more a county under Sebasteia, and Leo Argyrus, son of Eustathius, was appointed military governor there, he who afterwards became magister and commander-in chief. But Melias had his seat at Euphrateia, and when Constantine Dux had been appointed in Charsianon, this Melias aforesaid came down and took possession of the ancient city of Lykandos and built it up and fortified it and took his seat there, and it was named a frontier pass by Leo, the Christ-loving emperor. After this he crossed from Lykandos to the mountain of Tzamandos and there built the city which is there now, and similarly this too was designated a frontier pass. And he took possession of Symposion also and made it into a county. And in the first reign of Constantine the Christ-loving sovereign, when his mother Zoe was associated with him, Lykandos became a province, and the first military governor to be nominated was the patrician Melias, who was, of course, at that time frontier warden if Lykandos. And this same Melias, both for the loyalty that was in him toward the emperor of the Romans and for his many and infinite feats of daring against the Saracens, was afterwards honoured with the rank of magister. Abara used to be a county under the province of Sebasteia, but in the time of the sovereign Romanus it became a frontier pass. By old-established rule the captain-general of the Mardaites of Attalia was appointed of course by the emperor; and therefore by Leo, the emperor, of most blessed memory, Stauracius, surnamed Platys, was appointed captain-general, who gave splendid service for several years, but disposed things ill at his ending. For when the protospatharius Eustathius, of the imperial chancellery, was sent as deputy military governor to the province of the Kibyrrhaiotai, certain jealousies and broils arose between them ; and sometimes Stauracius Platys, who relied upon the patrician Himerius, the foreign minister, as one who had been his intermediary with the emperor, would fall foul of the deputy Eustathius and indeed flatly oppose him in matters where he saw him acting or giving orders beyond his competence ; and sometimes, on the other hand, the deputy Eustathius would be at odds with Stauracius and would devise many assaults and artful accusations against him. For this reason the aforesaid Eustathius reported unfavourably on Stauracius, saying : «The province of the Kibyrrhaiotai cannot have two military governors, me, that is, and Stauracius, captain-general of the

243 to rtardaltes ; for while I give one set of orders and try to administer them, the aptain-general of the Mardaites will do something different, and being his >wn master acts wildly as he sees fit.» He reported other false charges besides, tnd concocted many artful accusations against him, composing some that lad an air of probability and inventing others that were calumnious and vild. These things he wrote down, relying of course upon the patrician dimerius, the foreign minister. And at that time the patrician Himerius vas more friendly with Eustathius than with Stauracius, though afterwards he two fell out and became full of enmity and replete with fury. The emperor, -hen, received this report of Eustathius and, acceding to the request of the mtrician Himerius, gave the authority of this captain-general to the pro.ospatharius Eustathius, the deputy. But when the emperor, of blessed memory, ‘xchanged the things below for the things above, Alexander his brother took jossession of the rule over the empire, and as he superseded all who had Deen appointed to any commands by the emperor his brother, of blessed (lemory, beingthereto persuaded by malicious and foolish men, so he superseded ,he aforesaid Eustathius also, and made another in his stead. For the noto rious Chase, who sprang from the race of the Saracens and continued a true iaracen in thought and manners and religion, the slave of the patrician Damian, this protospatharius Chase had at that time great freedom of inter course with the lord Alexander the emperor, as had also the protospatharius Niketas, the brother of Chase, who was made military governor of the Kibyrrhaiotai by this lord Alexander the emperor. Now this Niketas, brother of the aforesaid Chase, made a request to the emperor, saying : (As I am your old friend, it is fitting you should do me a favour; and I have a thing to request of your imperial majesty, and it is right that you should grant it to me.» The emperor being taken by surprise and asking n his turn what this request might be and promising to grant it whatever t was, the aforesaid Niketas made his request, saying : «I request that your imperial majesty should make my son captain-general of the Mardaites jf Attalia»; and the emperor, acceding to his request, on the occasion of i procession introduced into the Chrysotriclinus the son of the protospatha:*iu8 Niketas, the spatharocandidate Abercius, and appointed him captaingeneral of the Mardaites of Attalia, just as Leo the emperor, of blessed memory, had previously appointed Stauracius, surnamed Platys. It is the old rule, established from the beginning, as was said at the start, that the captaingeneral of the Mardaites is appointed by the emperor.

In the time of the emperor Theophilus, Scholasticius the door-keeper was chamberlain, and in the time of Michael, son of Theophilus, the patrician Damian was chamberlain and after him, in the same reign, Basil, the Christloving emperor, was chamberlain. In the time of Basil, the Christ-loving sovereign, there was no chamberlain during all his reign. In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving sovereign, the patrician Samonas was chamberlain, ind after him, in the time of the same emperor, the patrician Constantine. In the time of Alexander the emperor, the patrician Barbatus was cham berlain; and in the time of Constantine, the Christ-loving sovereign, the patrician Constantine, mentioned before in the time of the sovereign Leo, was chamberlain again; and in the time of the sovereign Romanus, the patrician Theophanes; and in the second reign of Constantine, the patrician Basil. In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving and ever-memorable emperor, lived the well-known Ktenas, an aged cleric of great wealth, who was preentor of the New Church and was skilled in singing as was no other at ihat time. This same Ktenas besought the patrician Samonas, who was at that time chamberlain, to intercede for him with the emperor so that he might be made protospatharius and wrear the mantle and go in procession to the Lausiacus and take his seat as protospatharius and receive a stipend of a pound, and in respect of this remuneration might give the emperor forty pounds. But the emperor could not bring himself to do this, saying that it was out of his power, and «to the great disgrace of my imperial majesty if a cleric becomes protospatharius». On hearing this from the patrician Samonas, this same Ktenas added to the forty pounds a pair of ear-rings valued at ten pounds, and a silver table with animals on it in gold relief, also valued at ten pounds. And the emperor, besought by the request of the patrician Samonas, the chamberlain, took the forty pounds of gold and the pair of ear-rings and the table with its gold on silver relief work, so that the total gift of the same Ktenas amounted to sixty pounds. Then the emperor made him protospatharius, and he received a stipend on that occasion of one pound. After being honoured with the rank of protospatharius this same Ktenas lived two years and then died ; and he received a stipend of one pound tor each of the two years.

Until the reign of Leo, the glorious and most wise emperor, there was no imperial galley for the emperor to embark in, but he used to embark in a scarlet barge ; except that, in the time of the Christ-loving sovereign Basil, when this same emperor visited the hot baths of Prousa, and again when he went to inspect the bridge of Rhegion that was, of course, being built by his mandate and providence, he embarked in a galley, and another galley followed behind. And the rowers who embarked in it were taken from the imperial barge and from the sailors of the Stenon. For of old the Stenon too had up to ten ships of war of the imperial navy. But since the emperor, of blessed memory, on most of his progresses always went to Pegai because of the palace he had built there, and in like manner to Hebdomon and to Hiereia and to Bryas, he used to embark in a barge, according to 'the old rule. But when he was going on a longer progress, to the hot baths of Prousa, for example, and to inspect the bridge of Rhegion, he would embark, as was said above, in a galley, and another galley would follow, because a larger number of nobles embarked with the emperor, and the rest in the second galley. But the glorious and most wise Leo, the emperor, who was rather more hospitably inclined towards magisters and patri cians and familiar friends of senatorial rank, and who always wished them to share his pleasure in this, reckoned that the barge was inadequate for the reception of a larger number of nobles, and constructed a galley, and would invariably embark in it wherever he desired to go. And there would go with him whomsoever he might desire of the nobles, both of magisters and patricians. For in the barge it used to be the rule that none other embar ked with the emperor except the colonel of the watch and the lord admiral and the foreign minister and the commander of the company and the private secretary and the secretary of the pleas and, when he was present in Constantinople, the commander-in-chief also, and the chamberlain and the master of the wardrobe and of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber whom soever the emperor commanded. For this reason, then, Leo, the glorious and most wise emperor, constructed the galley, and, some while after, he constructed another galley as well, which was known as the 'second’ and christened'Attaché’. Forthisemperor, of blessed memory, would go on distant

progresses, to Nicomedeia, for instance, to Olympus, to Pythia, and therefore he had the two galleys specially made for the service and recreation of himself and his nobles. For when he went out on a short progress, he used often to leave one of the complements behind in the hippodrome to guard the palace; because the brigade of the Arithmos, according to the old rule which has grown into force, goes out on active service under the commanderin-chief and they, this complement, stay behind in the hippodrome and do not go out on progress with the emperors in the ordinary way. From time immemorial the protospatharius of the basin has been an imperial appointment; and this protospatharius of the basin used to control and have beneath him all the oarsmen of the imperial barges, both scarlet and black, except for the barges of the Augusta : for the barges of the Augusta, both scarlet and black, were controlled by and under the authority of the master of the Augusta’s table. In the reign of Leo, the glorious and most wise emperor, when the new galleys were constructed by imperial mandate, ".his same protospatharius of the basin had beneath his authority the oarsmen bf these galleys also. Now, the aforesaid protospatharius of the basin would by ancient rule go down every day in the afternoon and take his seat in the basin (for which reason he was called the protospatharius of the basin), and would judge cases arising between the oarsmen, both of the barges and of the galleys, over whom he had authority, and would give sentence and administer according to the law. And whenever he found anyone acting beyond his competence or wronging another or remiss in his own work, he would punish him with a sound cudgelling. And, as has been said, all the oarsmen of the galleys and of the emperor’s barges, both scarlet and black, were beneath the hand and the supervision of the protospatharius of the basin. But the barges of the Augusta, both scarlet and black, were beneath the hand and the supervision of the master of the Augusta’s table, though of course the master of the table accounted for these barges not to the Augusta, but to the emperor. In the time of Leo, the glorious and most wise emperor, the protospatharius John, surnamed Thalasson, was protos patharius of the basin, and after him the protospatharius Podaron, and after him the protospatharius Leo Armenius, father of the protospatharius Arsenius, the lictor. These, the protospatharius Podaron and the protospa tharius Leo Armenius, had been chief oarsmen of the patrician Nasar, the lord admiral, and in the time of Basil, the Christ-loving sovereign, were

promoted from the navy and became chief oarsmen of the barge of the emperor ; and in the reign of Leo, the glorious and most wise emperor, when he constructed the galleys, he made them steersmen for their bravery and seamanship. And when a crisis arose, the emperor seconded the oarsmen of the two galleys, together with the steersmen of the first galley, to ships of war of the navy, giving them much needful equipment, such as shields, leather targes, very fine coats of mail and everything else that naval person nel require to take with them ; and the patrician Eustathius, the lord admiral, took them with the imperial fleet and went off against the enemy. All this the emperor did because the patrician Eustathius, the lord admiral, was intending to engage the enemy. And in their stead the imperial galley was steered by old Michael and that intelligent * * *, who were at that time chief oarsmen. And pending the return of the imperial oarsmen, those who rowed the galleys were Stenites from the complements of the Stenon. But when they returned from the campaign, they resumed the same employ ment that they had been in before. Then the emperor, to reward, as it were, the protospatharius Podaron because of the bravery he had shown and because he had approved himself above all others in the battle and had received a personal testimonial from the patrician Eustathius, the lord admiral, that there was in the navy none other like him for bravery and energy and the other virtues, and particularly for affection and upright loyalty toward the emperor, gave to him the authority of the protospatharius of the basin. But because he was illiterate, by order of the emperor a judge from the hippodrome used to go down and take his seat with him in the basin and judge the oarsmen. But the barges of the Augusta, as has been said before, were in the control of the master of the Augusta’s table. After this, the emperor appointed Podaron and Leo Armenius to be vice-admirals of the imperial navy, and as steersmen of his galley he appointed that old Michael, who was at that time chief oarsman of the galley, and had been second oarsman of the barge of Basil, the Christ-loving sovereign, and the other Michael, surnamed Barkalas, who had previously served in the navy as chief oarsman of the lord admiral, the patrician Eustathius, when he carried the Turks across and defeated Symeon, prince of Bulgaria. Now this Symeon, prince of Bulgaria, on learning that the navy had arrived in the river, and that the navy was about to carry over the Turks against him, constructed mantlets or wicker fencing, very strong and tough, so that the Turks might not be able to cross over, and by this device the Turks were

at first prevented from crossing. So the aforesaid Michael Barkalas and two other sailors took up their shields and swords and, leaping down from the warship with a brave and powerful rush, cut down the mantlets or wicker fences and opened the passage for the Turks. The Turks, who watched this Barkalas and exceedingly admired his bravery because he, by himself, advancing in front of the two sailors, was first to cut down the fencing, said in their admiration that this man ought to be named patrician and be head of the navy. So the emperor, on hearing of the bravery of Barkalas, made hirn second oarsman in the imperial galley. Thereafter, when Podaron and Leo became vice-admirals, old Michael and this Barkalas were appointed steersmen of the galley. The aforesaid Leo Armenius, father of the late protospatharius Arsenius, the lictor, died a vice-admiral of the navy ; but the protospatharius Podaron was after some years appointed military governor in the province of the Kibyrrhaiotai. When Podaron became vice-admiral, the protospatharius Theophyiact Bimbilidis was appointed protospatharius of the basin, who was nephew of the protospatharius John, surnamed Thalasson, and he lasted during a few years of the first reign of Constantine the Porphyrogenitus, the Christ-loving sovereign. On his death, since old Michael aforesaid was grown very old indeed and had given many long years of service as steersman, he was honoured with the rank of protospatharius and was also appointed protospatharius of the basin. And when the emperor embarked on the galley in the basin and set out either upon a progress or somewhere else, that good old man, ever memorable for his seamanship, would take his stand amidships of the galley, inspiring and urging the oarsmen of the galley to pull and row more bravely and manfully, and at the same time instructing the steersmen of the day how to manage the rudders and steer the imperial vessel when the winds were blowing distemperately. Well, he died ; and, owing to the infancy of the emperor and the indiscretion of the patrician and chamberlain Constantine, the well-known Theodotus, at that time chief oarsman, was made steersman, and was at sundry times honoured with the ranks of candidate, strator, spatharius, spatharocandidate, and afterwards protospatharius and protospatharius of the basin ; he was son-in-law of the old Michael aforesaid. For by ancient rule a steersman of the emperor had never been made, or honoured with the

4mk of protospatharius, or even of spatharocandidate, but was either a :andidate or a strator or, at the most, a spatharius. And in the time of ^eo, the glorious and most wise emperor, this Michael alone was honoured vith the rank of spatharius and subsequently of spatharocandidate. But »wing, as has been said, to the infancy of the emperor and to the indisxetion of the patrician Constantine, the chamberlain, steersmen became patharocandidates, and this Michael a protospatharius. But when the unperor lord Romanus ascended into the palace and, somehow or other, »ossessed himself of the throne, he superseded Theodotus because of his iffection for Constantine, the Christ-loving sovereign and emperor, and tot only that but he punished him with flogging and tonsuring and dismised him to perpetual banishment, in which he came to the end of his life ; »ut his colleague in the steersmanship, the notorious Constantine Loricatus, he emperor lord Romanus let be, because Loricatus was affectionately dispoed towards him through fear and had renounced, by an oath written in is own hand, his affection and love toward the emperor Constantine ; him he emperor lord Romanus first honoured with the rank of spatharocandidate, ind, after making him first steersman and appointing him protospatharius d the basin, honoured him shortly afterwards with the rank of protos»atharius. Now, this man, by means of a memorial to the cleric John, whom Jod had allowed to become rector, put before the emperor, of blessed memory, he lord Romanus, this suggestion: «The protospatharius Theophylact, naster of the Augusta’s table, since he is an appointment and a support f the mother of the emperor and of the emperor himself, must necessarily ie in sympathy with his own masters and benefactors. Besides, what need is here for the men of the barges of the basin to be divided between two uthorities? For the master of the Augusta’s table, governed by his affection owards the emperor and the Augusta, may mislead the sailors of the barges >f the Augusta, who are under his control, and perhaps even the oarsmen f the galleys, and they will plan a rising against your imperial majesty.» Vith these words he won over that evil and crooked rector, and through dm the emperor. For it is easy for a light head and indiscreet heart to be educed and fall towards every malicious word and hint. He spoke and won hem over, and, having won them over, was given the authority over the »arges of the Augusta also. And since then it has become the rule for the teersman of the imperial galley to have charge of and exercise authority

In the time of Leo, the Christ-loving and ever-memorable emperor, a emand was made from the provinces of the west, through the protosatharius Leo Tzikanes, the military governor, for ready money from those rho opted against military service. And again, in the time of the same Christ-loving and ever-memorable .eo, ready money was demanded from the provinces of the west, through fie magister John Eladas, who was then patrician. And again in the time of the sovereign Romanus, who desired the eloponnesians to do military service in Lombardy, the protospatharius ohn Proteuon being then military governor in Peloponnesus, these same eloponnesians opted against military service, but to give instead a thousand orses, with saddles and bridles, and one hundred pounds in ready money, nd these they supplied with great readiness.

When Diocletian was emperor in Rome, and Themistus, son of Themiis, was chief magistrate and primate in the country of the Chersonites, aromatus the Bosporian, son of Criscoronus, gathered together the rmatians who dwelt on the Maeotie lake and marched against the Romans, d, having occupied the country of the Lazi and defeated those 0 were there, arrived as far as the Halys river. The emperor Diocletian, rning this, that the country of the Lazi and the Pontic land were being 1 waste, sent thither an army with intent to oppose the Sarmatians. The nmander of the army was Constans the tribune, and Constans, having ched the Halys with the army, sat down there and prevented the Samia ns from crossing the Halys. And being unable himself to oppose ;m, Constans resolved in his own mind that in no other wav could he oel the Sarmatians except perhaps if some of the neighbours of the Bospois and of the Maeotie lake were sent out to make war upon them and Yider their families, in order that Sauromatus might hear of it and retire m the war ; and to communicate this in a message to the emperor, so it the emperor should send to the Chersonites and rouse them against the •matians, their neighbours, and to attack their families, so that SauroTus, when he heard of it, might speedily retire from the war. Hearing s, the emperor Diocletian at once sent to the Chersonites bidding them join him in the war and to go and plunder the country of the Bosporians 1 Sarmatians and take their families captive. The chief magistrate and mate of the country of the Chersonites was at that time Chrestus, son Papias, and the Chersonites willingly obeyed the words of the emperor 1 therefore set about devising in what manner they might be able to »ture the city of Sauromatus, Bosporus, and the forts of the Maeotis, ey gathered together the men of the neighbouring forts and constructed litary waggons and placed in them the so-called arbalests, and they ived at the city of the Bosporians and, after laying an ambush while vas night, a handful of them joined battle at the city; and having fought the wall from dawn till the third hour, they made a show of flight, not

But the Chersonites, it appears, retiring gradually, destroyed the pursuing Bosporians th the arbalests, and the Chersonites besides who lay in ambush started and surrounded the Bosporians and put them all to the sword, and, .urning, captured Bosporus and in like manner also the forts on the leotic lake and all the families of the Sarmatians ; and they took up their arters in Bosporus, putting none to the sword thereafter save those 10 had fought, and they held on to Bosporus and guarded it. After some ys interval, Chrestus, son of Papias, said to the women of the Sarmatians : Je ourselves had no need to make war upon you, but since Sauromatus s gone off to ravage the country of the Romans, we, being for this reason Iden by the emperor of the Romans, whose subjects we are, have made r on you. So now, if you would live in your city, come, let us send envoys your lord Sauromatus, so that he may conclude peace with the Romans sight of our envoys and withdraw from those parts, and we will leave u and go off to our city ; but only when Sauromatus so escorts our envoys ther and sends us with his own men the news of the peace, then so will i leave you and withdraw ; but if Sauromatus so much as tries to proceed any trickery, believing he may cut us off here and attack us, and we get know of it through our scouts, we will put all of you, both small and great, the sword and so withdraw hence. And what good will Sauromatus get it hereafter, if all his family and the city are destroyed?» Hearing this, e women of Sauromatus made preparations to carry it out with alacrity, id with the Bosporians the Chersonites sent to Sauromatus five envoys their own, to inform him of what had been done and said. Well, íen the envoys reached Sauromatus, in the region of the Halys river, ey reported to him all that had been done against the Bosporians by the lersonites. He was in great perturbation, and, pretending to desire, as appears, that the envoys of the Chersonites should take rest after eir journey, said to them : «Since you are fatigued, I desire you to rest lurselves a few days and then I will do all that you have said ; *** go

On hearing this, Constans was quite cast down, and said to the Chersonites : «And what good, then, is your alliance to me, now that I have made agreements to give them so much gold?» The Chersonites said to him : «Be not cast down, my lord : if you wish, we will dissolve the agreement for your payment.» Constans said to them: «How is it possible?» The Chersonites said to him : «Do you, for your part, thus declare to Sauromatus : 'The agreements already made between us hold good ; and now, since on your account I too have incurred expenses and great losses on my way hither from Rome with the army, do you, for your part, pay me these, and I will give you back all your families md your city’.»Constans was overjoyed and sent this message to Sauromatus. Sauromatus, when he heard it, was exceedingly downcast, and sent to Constans a message saying : «I will neither pay nor take anything at all; do you but send me the Chersonites, that I may withdraw hence.» The Chersonites said to Constans : «Do not dismiss us until you get back all the prisoners.» Then Constans sent a message to Sauromatus saying : ((Send me all whom you hold prisoners, and I will dismiss the Chersonites.» Sauro matus, when he heard it, unwillingly and against his desire dismissed all the prisoners whom he held, to the last one of them. So then Constans, having got back all those who had been taken in the forays, kept with him two envoys of the Chersonites and sent the others to Sauromatus, and Sauromatus received them and sent them on ahead out of the country of the Lazi, together with one of his own men, to whom might be handed over Bosporus and their families. Sauromatus himself put his march with his nation in train, so that the Chersonites might honestly hand over the families and withdraw. The Chersonites, having received their own envoys in Bosporus and having learnt all that had been done by Constans and Sauromatus, handed over to Sauromatus’ agent both Bosporus and the forts of the Maeotis and all the families, unharmed, and came in peace to the country

«f the Chersonites. Constans, too, on the withdrawal of Sauromatus from the Roman territories, himself set out for Rome, and reported to the emperor all that had been done by the Chersonites; and he brought their two envoys also, whom the emperor saw and bounteously entertained and thanked most gratefully, and then said to them : «What will you that I should grant to you and your city in return for this affection and alliance?» They said to the emperor : «We, my lord, wish for nothing else, but request this one thing only, that your state should grant us pledges of freedom and immunity from tribute.» The emperor gladly acceded to their request and ungrudgingly granted them these pledges of freedom and of immunity from tribute, and sent them to the country of the Chersonites with very many gifts besides, as true subjects of the empire of the Romans. Constans too was grandly entertained by the emperor Diocletian for his brave resist ance in the war of the Sarmatians, and became noble and illustrious and after a short while was proclaimed emperor of the Romans, when Diocletian had retired to Nicomedeia. On the death of Constans, his son Constantine became emperor at Rome, and when he came to Byzantium, and certain of those in Scythia revolted against him, he called to mind what had been said by his father Constans concerning the affection of the Chersonites and their alliance, and he sent envoys to the country of the Chersonites, with instructions that they should go to the country of the Scythians and fight those who had revolted against him. The chief magistrate and primate of the Chersonites was at that time Diogenes, son of Diogenes, and the Chersonites gladly obeyed the imperial mandate and with all zeal constructed the military waggons and the arbalests and arrived at the Ister river and, having crossed it, arrayed hemselves against the rebels and routed them. The emperor, learning of the victory won by them, bade them go back to their country, but their primates he invited to the city of Byzantium and, after thanking them most gratefully, he said to them : «Since now too you have acted affectionately an our behalf, as in the time of the pious forbears of our divine majesty, see, we too do ratify the pledges of freedom and immunity from tribute already granted to you in the city of the Romans by our imperial government; and for our part we give you besides a golden statue with imperial cloak and clasp and a golden crown, for the beautifying of your city, and thereto our charter of freedom and immunity from tribute for you and for your sailors ; and, for the purity of your affection, we give you also golden

Diogenes and those with him were then honoured with a multitude of supplies and gifts by Constantine, the emperor beloved of God, and came to the country of the Chersonites, bringing back the gifts conferred by his divine majesty. Some years after these events had taken place, Sauromatus, grandson of Sauromatus the son of Criscoronus who had attacked Lazike, gathered together a warlike power from the Maeotie lake and rose against the Chersonites, desiring, it appears, to avenge the insult of the captivity done to his grandfather by them in the time of Diocletian the emperor. The Chersonites, Byscus, son of Supolichus, being at that time chief magistrate and primate of Cherson, learnt of this and on their side arrayed themselves in opposition and met Sauromatus outside, in the region of Kapha, so-called, and they fought with him, and, God aiding the Chersoni tes, defeated Sauromatus and drove him off; and they set up boundarystones in that same Kapha by name, in the place where they had fought and defeated Sauromatus, and there this same Sauromatus and those that were left with him swore oaths in due form that theyr would never more pass for purposes of war beyond the boundary-stones set up between them, but that each of them should keep to his own places on his side of the boundarystones set up. And so they withdrew, Sauromatus to Bosporus, and the Chersonites to their own homes. When this had been done, once more after some years another Sauromatus rose up and with him a multitude of men from the Maeotie lake, and they drew up their force against the Chersonites, and, crossing over the boundary-stones set up in Kapha by the first Sauromatus with an oath that

aone of the Bosporians should ever attempt to pass beyond them for purposes of war, this Sauromatus passed beyond them, as desiring to avenge and re cover the land forcibly taken from him. In those times the chief magistrate and primate of the country of the Chersonites was Pharnacus, son of Pharna us, and the Chersonites on their side arrayed themselves against Sauromatus, and they met one another in the region of the aforesaid Kapha, and each side took up position on the mountains. Sauromatus, being of huge stature, had confidence in himself and boasted insolently over the Chersonites, confiding also at the same time in the infinite multitude that was with him. But Pharnacus was of small stature compared to Sauromatus, and, seeing the multitude of Sauromatus, resolved with his own army that he should fight in single combat with Sauromatus, to avoid the destruction of an infinite multitude. This resolution having been made, Pharnacus made a declaration to the multitude of Sauromatus, saying : «What need is there of the destruction of so great a throng ? For you have not resorted to war of your own choice, but Sauromatus has bidden you to it. Do you, then, urge him to fight in single combat with me, and if by God’s aid I overpower him, do you withdraw unharmed to your own homes, and he and his city shall have fallen beneath me ; but if he overpowers me, in this case also you withdraw to your own homes, and he shall have become master over mine.» The throng of the Sarmatians accepted this with joy, and told Sauromatus to fight in single combat with Pharnacus. So Sauromatus, learning that Pharnacus was quite small in stature, while he himself was gigantic, was delighted at this, for he trusted in his own strength and in his armour, by which he was completely protected. This being so resolved upon, Pharnacus said to his army : «When I go down with God’s aid to the single combat, and you see that Sauromatus has his back towards you and his face towards his own men, while I have my face towards you and my back towards the enemy, do you all raise one shout, saying simply 'Ah! Ah!’, and after the shout, do not repeat it.» And so, when both had gone down to the plain for the single combat, and were manoeuvring about one another, and Pharnacus had taken the ground of Sauromatus and Sauromatus that of Pharnacus, the army of Pharnacus gave one shout, 'Ah! Ah!’. Sauromatus, hearing this shout, turned about in the action to see what cry was raised in the army of

harnacus. And as Sauromatus turned his face to the rear, the plating of his elmet opened a crack, and at once Pharnacus charged upon him and smote auromatus with his lance and slew him. When Saurornatus had fallen, 'harnacus got down from his horse and cut off his head, and, having won he battle, dismissed the multitude of the Maeotis, but took prisoner them f Bosporus and took away their land and set up boundary-stones in Lybernikon, beyond the country of the Chersonites, leaving to the Bosporians md up to forty miles only, and these boundary-stones remain to this day, nd the said first boundary-stones in Kapha are laid aside. Pharnacus, keeping y him some few of the Bosporians to do agricultural work, in pity dismissed 11 the rest, to go to the country of the Bosporians, and they, dismissed by ’harnacus, erected a column to him in Bosporus for the beneficence and aercy which he had shown towards them. From that time, then, the rule f the Sauromati in Bosporus was ended. These events, then, fell out so; but when Lamachus was chief magistrate nd primate of the country of the Chersonites and Asander was king of the ountry of the Bosporians, the Bosporians, being replete with much malice igainst the Chersonites and wholly unable to rest from wickedness, were till eager how they might pay back the recompense of the captivities upon he Chersonites. And so, learning that Lamachus had an only daughter, jykia, while Asander had sons, they set about contriving the conclusion >f a marriage alliance, in order that thereby they might safely gain a footing n the country of the Chersonites and take vengeance on it. And so they :ent envoys to the country of the Chersonites, with this request: «If we mow that sincere love exists between us, and if our relations one toward mother are without guile, let us make for ourselves a marriage alliance, md do you give us the daughter of Lamachus, your first man, to be bride )f the son of Asander our lord, or else receive him on your side as son-in-law, md we shall know that we have faith one toward another when the king’s ion is among you.» The Chersonites said to them : «We cannot consent to jiving our daughter to you ; but if from among the sons of Asander your ring you would like to give us a son-in-law, we accept, but on such terms ihat the son of Asander who comes to us to be allied in marriage shall no onger have in his power ever at any time or season to attempt to return :o the country of the Bosporians for the purpose of visiting or greeting his

|ther, and if he shall resolve to do this, surely he dies that hour,» The nvoys were dismissed and reached the country of the Bosporians and eported this, and Asander once more sent envoys, saying to the Chersonites : If you speak truly, and assure me that Lamachus consents to yoke his laughter with my eldest son, that same son will I send there to you, to be oined in marriage.» Lamachus in those days, as it appears, prided dmself upon much wealth, in gold and silver, male and female slaves, and attle of various kinds and many estates, and his mansion occupied ground ar and wide in four wards, as far as to below the so-called Sosae, in which t had its own gate in the wall and four main gate-ways for ingress and gress, together with other small side-entrances, so that when his cattle ntered the city, each herd of beasts, stallions and mares, cows and heifers, heep and asses, came in through its own gate, and went to its own stabling. The Chersonites, therefore, begged Lamachus that this son of Asander night be his son-in-law. Lamachus granted their request, and the son of Asander came to Cherson and married Gykia. And after the short space of wo years, Lamachus died ; the mother of Gykia had died before him. So, fter the lapse of a year, when the anniversary of her father’s burial was »ear, Gykia, wishing to keep bright the memory of her father, begged he leading men of the city, the chief magistrate and primate of Cherson >eing Zethus, son of Zethon, that they would kindly consent, together with til the populace, to receive from her wine and loaves of bread and oil, flesh ind game and fish, and anything else needed to make merry, to the end hat upon this day of the commemoration of Lamachus all the citizens, vith their wives and children and all their families, should feast and rejoice, ach in his own ward, and dance in the streets and completely abstain from iny work ; and she promised the citizens upon oath that each year of her ife she would in the same way give them the means of merry-making at his same commemoration of Lamachus. This being so arranged and conirmed by her upon oath, her husband, the son of Asander, who was plotting n secret and looking for an occasion of treachery, when he heard what jykia had said and confirmed on oath, admired and congratulated Gykia ipon the sworn convenant, as one showing a truly filial spirit towards her >arents, and consented himself also, as it appears, to rejoice and pour

a libation on this covenanted occasion. Afterwards, when the commemora tion and merry-making had gone by, he made a declaration to those in Bosporus, through his confidential slave, and said to them : «I have found a means whereby we shall take Cherson without trouble ; do you, there fore, send to me at intervals ten or twelve serviceable young fellows, in addition to the rowers of the ship, on the pretext that you are sending me presents, and let your ships that come hither put in at Symbolon and wait there, and I will escort and convey on horseback to the city the youths who come and the presents that are sent.» And so, in this manner, over a period of two years the Bosporians came, a few at a time, bringing the presents in order that the plot might not become known to the city, and the son of Asander conveyed them on foot from Symbolon, and then again a few days later, in sight of all, towards evening he would, as it appears, send them off outside the city, of course at as late an hour as he could. They would go out of the city a distance of three miles, and then, when it was pitch dark, would turn about and come to the so-called Limon, and thence he would convey them by boat to Sosae, and, through the side-gate which he had in the wall, would introduce them into his mansion; none being privy save three Bosporian slaves of his, who were his only confidants, one of whom used to go to Symbolon and give the word for the ships to depart, another would turn the Bosporians about and convey them to Limon, and the other would carry them by boat from Limon to Sosae and return them to the mansion of Lamachus ; and by the agency of these three slaves he maintained them in his magazines, without even Gykia’s being aware of the plot; and he expected, as has been said, on the anniversary of the commemoration of Lamachus, while all the city was making merry or had gone to sleep, to start up in the night with the Bosporians and his own tlaves, and burn the city and put everyone to the sword. Now when, during she space of two years, as many as two hundred Bosporians had been collected in Gykia’s mansion, and the commemoration of Lamachus was then already approaching, it fell out that a girl slave of Gykia, a chamber-maid, of whom she was exceedingly fond, committed some fault and was banished from her company and shut up. The room in which the girl slave was shut up had beneath it the Bosporians who were being maintained. It happened that, while the girl slave was sitting and spinning flax, the weight fell off her

spindle and rolled and dropped into a very deep crevice by the wall. Getting up to recover it, she saw it lying in a very deep crevice, and, being unable owing to the depth to pluck it out, she was forced to pluck up a brick from the floor by the wall in order to recover it, and she saw through the crevice down below in the basement room the multitude of men who were there. When she had seen, she deftly put the brick back again in its place in order not to reveal herself to those below, and sent in secret one of the ser vants and invited her mistress to come to her, for there was something need ful for her to hear and see. Gykia, pricked on by God, went to the slave girl, and when she entered the room alone and closed the door, the girl slave fell at her feet and said : «Lady, yours is the power over your unworthy slave : but I would show to my mistress a matter strange and unlooked-for.» Gykia said to her : «Fear n o t: speak and show what this is.» The girl slave led her to the wall and, deftly raising the brick, said to her : «Do you see, lady, through the crevice the throng of Bosporians in hiding below?» Gykia looked and was astonished at the affair, and said : «This is a serious plot!» And she said to the girl slave : «How did you find out this matter?» The girl slave said : «Surely, lady, by the will of God, the weight fell off my spindle and rolled and dropped into this crevice, and as I was unable to recover it I was forced to pluck up the brick, and then I saw them.» She bade the girl slave put the brick back deftly in its place, and then she caught her in her arms and embraced her and kissed her in earnest, and said to her: «Fear nothing, child ; your fault is forgiven you, for God willed you to err, so that He might reveal the plot to us ; see, now, that you do all you can to keep the matter close, and do not venture to entrust it to anybody at all.» And for the future she kept her wholly with herself as her confidante, even more than at first. Then Gykia summoned two of her relations, who were very much in her confidence, and said to them in private : «Go and collect together on their own in secret the primates and nobles of the city, and let them choose out three men in whom they confide, men who can keep a secret and do a deed, and let them all upon oath be surety for these men that they will satisfy me in what I am about to ask of them, and let them send them to me in secret, and I will entrust to them a thing necessary and advantageous for the city ; only do with speed what I tell you.» Her relations went off and told this in secret to the

These men went in secret to Gykia, who received them and said ,o them : «Are you able to satisfy me on oath concerning these things that i am about to ask of you, that you will do them?» They said to her: «Yes, ady, we will readily satisfy you concerning what you are about to require if us, that your words shall be carried out to the end.» Then Gykia said ,o them : «Satisfy me that if I die, you will bury me in the middle of the lity, and I will tell you my secret; see, I do not require anything at all burdensome of you.» The men, on hearing this, with all readiness satisfied ler upon oath, saying : «If you die, we will bury you in the middle of the lity and will not carry you outside the walls.» Gykia believed their oaths, ind said to them : «In view of the satisfaction you have given me, I on my art will now discover my secret to you ; see now, I would have you know :hat my husband, who has the congenital vice of his city, that of plotting and envy against us, has introduced secretly into my mansion a throng of Bosporians, a few at a time, as many as two hundred souls, armed, and maintains them, I being in ignorance of the affair ; but now God has found an occasion to reveal it to me. This, then, is his plan, that, so it appears, when at the commemoration of my father I provide the merrymaking to the city and you have made merry and are gone to sleep, he will start up in the night with the Bosporians that are with him, and with his own slaves, and will set fire to your houses and put you all to the sword. See, now, my father’s commemoration approaches, and I must, in accordance with my oath, give you as usual the means of merry-making, for I have all ready therefor. Do you, then, all run up joyfully and ask for and take everything eagerly, so that he may not yet realise that we have got to know of the affair, and a civil war suddenly break out. Resolve, therefore, to make merry publicly as usual, though moderately, and to dance in the squares, but let each make ready in his house timber and faggots and dry torches, so that when you are tired of the merrymakings and dances you may appear to go off to take your rest, and 1 for my part will get tired of them rather early and order my doors to be made fast, and then you, very quietly, with your male and female slaves and all your households, must at once bring along the timber and faggots and torches and pile them

Go now, and tell this secret, and make ready all that I have told you.» When they heard these things from the three men, the citizens hastily did all in accordance with the word of Gykia. When the commemoration day was upon them, Gykia, with an appearance of enjoyment, sent for the men of the city and told them to take the means of merry-making. And her husband, too, helped in this and begged that more wine should be given them for the merry-making. The citizens gladly took everything and began to make merry, as they had been ordered, and danced all the day; but when evening had come the citizens began to get tired of it, and to go off to their houses to take their rest. And they made merry with all their households. Gykia in her house urged all her people to drink freely in order that they might get drunk and sleep the sooner, only enjoining upon her chambermaids to be sober, and she herself abstained from wine. For she had found a purple goblet and gave it to her chamber-maid, who was in the secret, and instructed her to pour water into it for her. Her husband, seeing the purple goblet, did not suspect that she was drinking water out of it. When evening had come, and the citizens, as I have already said, had got tired of the merry making, Gykia said to her husband : «We have made merry ; come, now let us too take our rest.» Hearing this, her husband was only too glad, and hastened to go to sleep ; for he could not have said this himself, in case he might give his wife a hint of the plot he was hatching. So Gykia ordered the doors to be made fast and all the windows, and the keys to be brought to her as usual. When this was done, she said aside to her confidential chamber-maid, the one who knew of the plot: «You, with the rest of the chamber-maids, are deftly to remove all my jewelry and gold, and anything else of use that you can carry in your bosoms, and make yourselves ready, so that when I give you the word, you may follow me.» They did as she bade them, and were ready. Her husband was of course lying down in order to take a hasty nap and to get up again in a short while for his treachery against the city ; but Gykia avoided going to sleep until all their house

tl was sleeping, and her husband was soundly off after his deep potations. Ida, seeing him asleep, deftly made fast the bed-chamber with the key, utting her husband in, came down from the house with her chamberlids, went quietly out of the side-gates and locked them, and at once ve the word to them of the city to light the fire quickly all round the use. The fire was lit and the house caught, and if any of those within inaged to jump or throw himself out, he was slain by the citizens. The tole house, with its contents, was gutted to the foundation, and God ^served the city of the Chersonites from the treacherous Bosporians. hen the citizens wished to dig into her gutted house and to clear the e for building, Gvkia would not allow it, but rather bade all the city ing, each one of them, and empty out on that spot all their ordures, that her whole dwelling might be buried deep in them, inasmuch as it had wed for treachery against the city; and so unto this day the place has en called the Spy-tower of Lamachus. All these things having so fallen out, the Chersonites, seeing the infinite aefits that Gykia had, under God, conferred upon them, and that she d not spared anything of her own at all, but had put first the salvation the city, erected in payment for this service she had done them two onze statues to her honour in the city square, representing her as young years, as then, at that time, she was, and therein showing her ineffable nefits and affection toward the citizens, in that at her tender age she Ld shown such wisdom for the preservation, under God, of her own fatherad. For upon one column they set her soberly adorned and discovering the citizens the tale of her husband’s treachery, and upon the other they presented her in action and fighting against the betrayers of the city; id thereto, upon the base of her statue, they also inscribed all the benefits lieh she had, under God, conferred upon the citizens. And if any would ! a lover of virtue, he regularly scours from time to time the base of the me, so that what is there written may be read and there may be a reminir of what she did, and a refutation of the treacherous Bosporians. And after some years, when the chief magistrate and primate of the mntry of the Chersonites was Stratophilus, son of Philomusus, Gykia, ho had most excellent wit, desired to put the Chersonites to the proof

t to know whether in fact they would fulfil the sworn promise and bury
in the middle of the city ; and having concerted with her girl slaves, 3 made herseF as one who was weary of life and had died. Her girl slaves d her out on the bier and sent a message to the citizens, saying : «Our ly has died, and do you point out to us in what place she is to be buried.» ie Chersonites, when they heard that Gykia was dead, turned the matter er in their minds and were no longer eager to fulfil the oath that she ould be buried in the middle of the city, and they took her up and bore r outside the city to bury her. But when the bier was set down at the mb, Gykia sat up and looked about on all the citizens and said : «Is this ur sworn promise? Is this your truth in all your dealings? Woe to him, en, who puts faith in a Chersonite citizen !» The Chersonites, seeing the ock she had made of them, were greatly ashamed of their conduct in eaking their word, and earnestly besought her to be appeased and to irdon their transgression and to rail upon them no more. And so they ve their word to her with a renewal of their oaths that thereafter they mid not bury her outside the city, but in the middle of the city, and .they did. And while she was still alive, they set up her coffin in the spot at she chose, and erected yet another bronze statue and gilded it and t it upon her tomb for greater assurance. Outside the city of Tamatarcha are many wells yielding naphtha. In Zichia, near the place called Pagi, which is in the region of Papagia id is inhabited by Zichians, are nine wells yielding naphtha, but the oils the wells are not of the same colour, some of them being red, some yellow, id some blackish. In Zichia, in the place called Papagi, near which is a village called ipaxi, which means 'dust’, there is a spring yielding naphtha. There is there yet another spring yielding naphtha, in the village died Chamouch. Chamouch is the name of the man of olden times who tündéd the village : for this reason that village was called Chamouch. hese places are distant from the sea a journey of one day without changing orses. In the province of Derzene, near the village of Sapikion and the village ailed Episkopion, is a well yielding naphtha.

If ever the men of the city of Cherson revolt or decide to act contrary o the imperial mandates, then all Chersonite ships at Constantinople must >e impounded with their cargoes, and Chersonite sailors and passengers nust be arrested and confined in the gaols; and then three imperial agents nust be sent: one to the coast of the province of the Armeniakoi, another o the coast of the province of Paphlagonia, and another to the coast of he province of the Boukellarioi, in order to take possession of all Chersonite ihips, and to impound the cargo and the ships, and to arrest the men and confine them in public prisons, and to report upon these matters and as ,hey may be instructed. Moreover, these imperial agents must forbid the 3aphlagonian and Boukellarian merchant-ships and coastal vessels of 3ontus to cross to Cherson with grain or wine or any other needful commoiity or merchandise. Then, the military governor too must be instructed ,o sequestrate the ten pouds granted by the treasury to the city of Cherson md also the two pounds of tribute, and then the military governor must withdraw from Cherson and go to another city and take up residence there. If the Chersonites do not journey to Romania and sell the hides and wax that they get by trade from the Pechenegs, they cannot live. If grain does not pass across from Aminsos and from Paphlagonia and the Boukellarioi and the flanks of the Armeniakoi, the Chersonites cannot live.
