The Huns
This volume is a concise introduction to the history and culture of the Huns. This ancient people had a famous reputation in Eurasian Late Antiquity. However, their history has often been evaluated as a footnote in the histories of the later Roman Empire and early Germanic peoples. Kim addresses this imbalance and challenges the commonly held assumption that the Huns were a savage people who contributed little to world history, examining striking geopolitical changes brought about by the Hunnic expansion over much of continental Eurasia and revealing the Huns’ contribution to European, Iranian, Chinese and Indian civilization and statecraft. By examining Hunnic culture as a Eurasian whole, The
Huns provides a full picture of their society which demonstrates that this was a complex group with a wide variety of ethnic and linguistic identities. Making available critical information from both primary and secondary sources regarding the Huns’ Inner Asian origins, which would otherwise be largely unavailable to most English speaking students and Classical scholars, this is a crucial tool for those interested in the study of Eurasian Late Antiquity.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I dedicate this work to my parents and to other members of my family whose support and encouragement have been the bedrock of my academic career. I would also like to thank in particular Professor Peter B. Golden, the Khagan of Inner Asian Studies, whose superb research, insightful comments and excellent scholarship have informed every aspect of my own comparatively deficient inquiry. We really need another Peter Golden to write a definitive and authoritative history of the Huns in the future. Sadly that possibility seems remote, for who could replicate such great scholarship? Naturally all assertions and possible errors in this book are my own. I would like to thank Professor Samuel Lieu, from whose great scholarship I have likewise benefited. I would also like to express my gratitude to my old friend and supervisor Dr Timothy Rood, whose guidance and scholarship on ethnicity have informed many aspects of my research. Special thanks to my dear friend and brother Dr Selim Adali for his extremely helpful comments, suggestions and proofreading of this book. I would like to thank Professor Etienne de la Vaissiere for his comments on the White Huns and also the helpful critique of Professor Richard Payne. Although I do not know him personally, I would like to thank Professor Peter Heather for his generous comments regarding my previous work on the Huns and at the same time acknowledge my debts to his pioneering research on various aspects of Late Antiquity from which I have learned greatly. I would like to thank the various reviewers of my previous book on the Huns, for their critique and comments, some of which I agree with, some I disagree with strongly, but nevertheless they have all been instructive. I would like to thank Dr. Tibor Schäfer for our interesting debates and comments on each other’s works. I would like to thank Dr Michelle Negus Cleary for helping me with making the maps for this book. Thanks also to Professor Ursula Brosseder for the images of Xiongnu artefacts. I would like to thank Dr Susan Walker and Dr Shailendra Bhandare of the Ashmolean museum for supplying me with the images of Kushan coins. My thanks to Mr Peter Mayall for the images of Hunnic deformed skulls. I would like to thank the academic staff at the Central European University in Hungary for hosting me while I was in Hungary, one of the most beautiful countries I have had the privilege of visiting. I would also like to thank many of the Hungarian readership for their encouragement and kind emails. Last, but not least I would like to thank my academic colleagues here at the University of Melbourne for their support, friendship and collegiality. This has been crucial to producing another book on the Huns in the space of two years.

INTRODUCTION
The Huns! The name of this ancient people triggers a multiplicity of responses and evokes a number of images (nearly all of them negative). Traditionally in Western Europe the Huns were identified with unspeakable savagery, destruction and barbarism. The name Hun in Western European parlance was a term of abuse, a derogatory epithet that one would use to defame a foreign enemy, such as imperial Germany in World War I which was labelled ‘the Huns’ by the hostile British and American press. The Huns have attained almost legendary status as the quintessential ‘savage’ nation, ‘a parasitic mob’ according to one modern historian, ‘running a vast protection racket’. Such is their reputation that even in academia there is still today a residue of this image of the ‘cruel savage’. In the not so distant past some scholars even argued without hesitation that the Huns contributed nothing to European civilization. All the Huns did was destroy and plunder, so it was claimed. However, as more evidence on the Huns and their empires came to light via the spectacular research of Inner Asian Studies experts, more recent scholarship on the Huns has begun to adopt a more balanced approach. It acknowledges that the ‘notorious’ Huns and other associated Inner Asian peoples were certainly not the simple ‘savages’ of lore, but a significant historical force not just in ‘Europe’, but also in ‘Asia’. The geographical division between Asia and Europe is hardly realistic when discussing a truly pan-Eurasian phenomenon such as the Huns and a pan-Eurasian phenomenon requires an Eurasian approach, which treats ‘Asian’ and ‘European’ history holistically, not as separate disciplines. Only then can one do justice to the striking geopolitical changes brought about by the Hunnic expansion over much of continental Eurasia. We, therefore, need to approach the socio-political, historical and geographical background of the Huns with this understanding in mind.
INNER ASIA: THE HOMELAND OF THE HUNS
In order to understand the real Huns, it is first necessary to discuss the region from which they originate, Inner Asia. Inner Asia is a term coined by modern historians to denote primarily (though not exclusively) the historical geography of peoples whom we commonly label ‘steppe nomads’. It would be a great mistake, however, to consider Inner Asia to consist of purely grass steppeland or think Inner Asians were solely ‘nomads’. Inner Asia, as defined by eminent historians such as Denis Sinor and Peter Golden, is a vast region encompassing all of what is today called Central Asia (the five Central Asian republics and Afghanistan), almost all of what is now southern Russia from western Siberia to the Pacific Ocean in the Far East, all of modern Mongolia and large portions of northern and western China. In this vast area there are extremes of climate, diverse ecosystems and varied topography. Inner Asia contains both regions with near arctic weather conditions and also some of the world’s hottest and most inhospitable deserts. Oases, deserts, many of the world’s highest mountain ranges, temperate forests,



taiga, as well as the steppes constitute the physical geography of Inner Asia. The peoples who historically called Inner Asia home were likewise equally diverse in their way of life. Inner Asia was home to pastoralists (whom we often mistakenly label as nomads), agriculturalists (farmers), hunter-gatherers and urban-dwellers. In many cases all four categories of peoples were to be found living in the same or adjacent regions in a complicated symbiotic system. A person belonging to one category could just as easily experience the lifestyle of the other categories during his or her lifetime. Many of these peoples also spoke multiple languages belonging to at least three, different, major language families: Altaic (thought to consist of Turkic, Mongolic and Tugusic languages: all mutually unintelligible); Indo-European (mainly Iranian and Tocharian languages); Yeniseian (now largely extinct languages spoken by indigenous peoples such as the Kets in central Siberia). The speakers of these three language families were also in frequent contact with other groups bordering Inner Asia who all spoke different languages. To the southeast of Inner Asia there were the Sino-Tibetan language groups (most prominently Chinese). To the southwest, Inner Asians interacted with Iranian and Semitic language speakers of the Middle East and also at times with the Indo-Iranian languages of South Asia (the Indian sub-continent). To the northwest they met the Indo-European and Uralic languages of Europe and western Siberia. All these groups and languages influenced Inner Asians and were in turn influenced by Inner Asians. In this complex world language did not always automatically lead to ethnic identity. Many Inner Asians had multiple identities. For instance a pastoralist in the fifth century AD living in what is now modern day Uzbekistan on the fringes of the steppe zone near the great urban centres of Samarkand and Bukhara may have spoken primarily a Turkic language when with other pastoralists, but when he frequented the cities to trade his livestock and acquire other much needed commodities he would have conversed just as easily in Sogdian (an East Iranian language). He may have at some stage in his life decided to settle as a city merchant or perhaps chosen the path of a mercenary soldier in the service of the local urban ruler, who may himself have come from the steppes. Equally frequent would have been the journey in the opposite direction. A Sogdian merchant from Bukhara or Samarkand could frequent the patoralist communities in the neighbourhood, maybe intermarry with his trade-partners and speak with equal proficiency the Turkic language of his in-laws as his native Sogdian. Neither the pastoralist who settled in the city nor the city-dweller who made his home in the steppes would have been regarded as particularly alien by the hosts. In fact during the fifth century AD both men would have belonged to the same political community and have been categorized as ‘Huns’, who were then ruling the region, while preserving also their multiple ethnic/sub-ethnic and linguistic identities. Their transition from one identity to another or conflation of multiple identities would have seemed distinctly normal. Furthermore, our pastoralist turned urban-dweller and urban merchant turned pastoralist may in their lifetimes have been exposed to various belief systems: to Turko-Mongol shamanism and Iranian Zoroastrianism from their native regions; Buddhism making inroads from India in the south; Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism being imported from the Middle East and the Mediterranean; even some doses of Chinese esoteric ideas (e.g. Daoism) from the east. They could have been practitioners of one or several of these different belief systems, quite



remarkably without the bloodshed and agonizing conflict that usually accompanied contacts between multiple belief systems in other parts of the world. Even more astonishingly perhaps, they could do what no other Eurasians could do with ease, that is physically travel to the places of origin of all these belief systems and ideas, since their native Inner Asia bordered all the other regions of Eurasia. What this demonstrates is the pluralism that was inherent to Inner Asian societies during the time of the Huns and also the geographical centrality of Inner Asia. Inner Asia was the critical link that connected all the great civilizations of Eurasia to each other: India, China, Iran and the Mediterranean world. Whatever happened in Inner Asia, therefore, had the potential to affect all the above mentioned adjacent regions of Eurasia. While the complexity and importance of Inner Asia described above applies equally to Inner Asia of all time periods, the period we shall be focusing on in this book is obviously the Hunnic period, roughly from the third century BC to the end of the sixth century A D , but also extending into later centuries via the brief coverage of the history of the successors to the legacy of the Huns. The history and impact of the Huns on both Inner Asia and the regions adjacent to Inner Asia during these centuries will be examined throughout this book.
NOMADS? THE HUNS, A HETEROGENEOUS AGRO-PASTORALIST SOCIETY
So, the Huns were from Inner Asia and therefore they were Inner Asians. However, what does that mean in practice? When one evokes the image of the Huns, one often imagines a fur-clad, primitive-looking race of nomads (usually of mongoloid extraction) emerging out of the ‘backward’ steppes of Inner Asia. Indeed the original Huns in Inner Asia were mostly pastoralists, partially or predominantly of Mongoloid extraction (at least initially). However, the term ‘nomad’, if it denotes a wandering group of people with no clear sense of territory, cannot be applied wholesale to the Huns. All the so-called ‘nomads’ of Eurasian steppe history were peoples whose territory/territories were usually clearly defined, who as pastoralists moved about in search of pasture, but within a fixed territorial space. One should not imagine that ‘nomads’ of the Eurasian steppe region lived in a political and geographical void with no territory and political control. Far from it, the ‘nomads’ such as the Huns operated under tight political organization and like other Inner Asian peoples described briefly above they were in fact hardly homogeneous either in lifestyle or in ethnic composition. Most steppe confederacies and ‘nomadic’ state or proto-state entities in Eurasian history possessed both pastoralist and sedentary populations and the Huns were certainly no exception to this general rule. These Inner Asian peoples, as already pointed out, were also highly heterogeneous both ethnically/racially and linguistically. The Huns themselves when they first entered Europe from Inner Asia were in all probability multi-ethnic and multi-lingual, consisting of a mix of a variety of Turkic and Iranian speaking peoples and ethnicities. Therefore, when one talks of the Huns, one should not necessarily assume that they constitute an ethnic group or racial group. Rather what one encounters is a complex political entity that consists of a wide variety of ethnic, racial and religious sub-categories, all in the process of fusion or acculturation, accommodating a great diversity of lifestyles and customs. In other words we are



dealing with a state or proto-state entity of imperial dimensions with a distinct Inner Asian flavour, rather than a simple, primitive ethnic, tribal or clan grouping. In fact the so-called ‘backward’ steppes of Eurasia was far from ‘primitive’ or ‘backward’ and modern archaeology has done wonders in revealing the astonishing sophistication of Inner Asian civilizations prior to the rise of the Huns. The history of Huns is as intriguing and complex as that of any other ‘great’ ‘civilized’ peoples of the ancient world, be they the Romans or the Greeks. What we encounter in the Huns of Inner Asia is a civilization that has been comparatively neglected by historians, whose contribution to world history has been consistently overlooked and under-estimated. This book has the aim of introducing the history and culture of the historical and archaeological (not the mythical, legendary and imaginary) Huns to the wider reading public and in particular to undergraduate students who are learning about the Huns for the first time and who may not be well acquainted with the history of either Inner Asia or Late Antique and Early Medieval Europe. As such it cannot systematically address all the complex issues and debates pertaining to the Huns. Notes have been reduced to a minimum to facilitate an easy read for the beginner and where greater discussion and extensive citations might be desired by the more academic readers, directions will be given to other major academic publications either by the author or by other experts on the subject. However, the book will nonetheless attempt to present some new innovative perspectives and where necessary will provide essential references and notes to support and illustrate the contention or argument being made for that purpose.
THE QUEST FOR ETHNICITY AND ORIGINS: WHO ARE THE HUNS?
Part of the difficulty with writing a history of a people like the Huns is the perplexing and seemingly endless debate about who they actually were. Where did they come from and with which historically attested group(s) of people or state entities should they be identified or associated with? These are big questions that have often frustrated the attempts at explanation by numerous scholars in the past. Fortunately for us new literary and archaeological evidence that has accumulated over the past six decades has completely revolutionized our understanding of the Huns, of who they were and has made the entire question regarding their origin and affiliation (ethnic and political) easier to answer. In the eighteenth century the remarkable Jesuit priest Deguignes in his now almost legendary work, Histoire generale des Huns, des Turcs, des Mogols et des
autres Tartares occidentaux ( 1 7 5 6 - 1 8 2 4 ) , made quite a spectacular conjecture based on his intuition. He equated the European Huns of the fourth and fifth centuries AD with the earlier powerful and sophisticated Xiongnu people (in what is now Mongolia) who appear in Chinese historical records of the Han dynasty (2 0 6 B C - 2 2 0 A D ). This conjecture then triggered a lively debate that has continued unabated for centuries. Historians and experts on the Huns and Inner Asia (most notably the great scholars Maenchen-Helfen and Sinor) tended to voice scepticism about the Hun-Xiongnu connection. They suggested that if any connections existed between the Huns and the Xiongnu, they are only likely to have been cultural affinities of some sort rather than blood connections. However, this very debate regarding the Hun-Xiongnu connection was often based on the erroneous



assumption that the Huns and Xiongnu constituted a specific race or a particular ethnic category. As explained above, the Huns and other Inner Asian steppe peoples like the Xiongnu must be viewed as heterogeneous political categories rather than homogenous ethnic groups. The key to understanding the links between the Xiongnu and the Huns is to recognize that the transmission of cultural and political heritage matters far more than potential ‘genetic’ links between the two groups. Due to the excellent research of La Vaissiere and others we are now more than ever before certain that the name Hun denoted the ancient Xiongnu. The first indication to that effect came in 1 9 4 8 when Henning published a letter written by a Sogdian merchant named Nanaivande dating to the year 3 1 3 A D . It was a letter sent from the Gansu region of western China relating the fall of the imperial Chinese capital Luoyang to the Southern Xiongnu in 3 1 1 AD . In it Nanaivande without any ambiguity calls the Xiongnu Huns. More recent evidence collected by La Vaissiere, the translations of ancient Buddhist sutras Tathagataguhya-sutra
and Lalitavistara by Zhu Fahu, a Buddhist monk from the western Chinese city of Dunhuang, who was of Central Asian Bactrian descent, reaffirmed this identification. Zhu Fahu, whose translations are dated to 2 8 0 AD and 3 0 8 AD respectively (so roughly contemporaneous with Nanaivande’s letter), identifies again without any ambiguity or generalization the Huna (appellation of the Huns in Indian sources) with the Xiongnu, as a specific political entity adjacent to
China.1 Therefore, it is now perfectly clear that the imperial Xiongnu of Mongolia
and China and the European-Central Asian Huns had exactly the same name.2 The archaeological evidence is more difficult to interpret, since the old practice of identifying archaeological cultures with ethnic groups cannot be seen as completely valid. The evidence available does, nonetheless, support the existence of strong cultural links between the European-Central Asian Huns and the old territory ruled by the Xiongnu. Most Inner Asian scholars now agree that Hunnic cauldrons, one of the key archaeological markers of Hunnic presence, ultimately
derive from Xiongnu cauldrons in the Ordos region in Inner Mongolia.3 These cauldrons, which clearly had a religious function, were used in the same way in both earlier Xiongnu and later Hunnic contexts, their placement being on the banks of rivers. Cultural and religious continuity can therefore be argued for between the Xiongnu of Mongolia and the Huns in Central Asia and Europe. Naturally the fact that the Huns and Xiongnu had the same ethnic or rather political name and shared very similar religious and cultural practices does not prove conclusively that the Huns and Xiongnu were genetically related, though it does make the case quite likely. However, the very fixation with identifying genetic/racial affinity is quite absurd when one takes into consideration the nature of the population groups that constituted the Xiongnu and the Huns. The old territory of the Xiongnu was home to a great variety of ethnic groups and also language groups. Our Chinese sources indicate that the Xiongnu Empire absorbed numerous nations of North Asia including the Mongolic speaking Donghu people to the east and the Indo-European speaking Yuezhi people (possibly Tocharians in what is now western China) to the west. There was doubtlessly also a large population of Turkic and Iranian language speakers among the Xiongnu. One of our extant sources furthermore indicates that some of



the Xiongnu, in particular the Jie tribe of the wider Xiongnu confederation, spoke a Yeniseian language. The Chinese source Jin Shu (9 5 .2 4 8 6 ), compiled in the seventh century AD, gives us a rare transliteration of a Xiongnu Jie song composed in a language most likely related to Yeniseian languages. This fact has led scholars such as Pulleyblank and Vovin to argue that the Xiongnu had a Yeniseian core
tribal elite,4 which ruled over various Tocharian-Iranian and Altaic (TurcoMongol) groups. However, whether the Jie tribe and the language they spoke is representative of the core ruling elite of the Xiongnu Empire remains uncertain
and other scholars strongly argue in favour of a Turkic,5 Mongolic or even Iranian ruling elite. It seems rather likely that the core language of the Xiongnu was either Turkic or Yeniseian (or maybe even both). However, no definitive conclusions can as yet be made about which linguistic group constituted the upper elite of their empire. The attempt itself may in fact be irrelevant since the Xiongnu were quite clearly a multi-lingual and multi-ethnic hybrid entity. To suggest otherwise would render simply incomprehensible the complexity and heterogeneity of the Xiongnu Empire. The European Huns were equally as heterogeneous as the Xiongnu of Mongolia. Their core language was very likely to have been Oghuric Turkic given the names of their kings and princes, which are for the most part Oghuric Turkic in origin as the list below shows:
1. Mundzuk (Attila the Hun’s father, from Turkic Muncuq = pearl/jewel) 2. Oktar/Uptar (Attila’s uncle, öktär = brave/powerful) 3. Oebarsius (another of Attila’s paternal uncles, Aibärs = leopard of the moon) 4 . Karaton (Hunnic supreme king before Ruga, Qaräton = black-cloak) 5. Basik (Hunnic noble of royal blood early fifth century, Bärsig = governor) 6. Kursik (Hunnic noble of royal blood, from either Kürsig, meaning brave or
noble, or Qursiq meaning belt-bearer).6
Furthermore, all three of Attila’s known sons have probable Turkic names: Ellac, Dengizich, Ernakh/Hernak, and Attila’s principal wife, the mother of the first son
Ellac, has the Turkic name Herekan, as does another wife named Eskam.7 The heavy concentration of Turkic peoples in the areas from which the Huns derived before their major expansion into Europe and Central Asia is likely to have led to the consolidation of a Turkic language as the dominant language among the
European Huns. A Chinese historical source the Weilue (=Sanguozhi 3 0 . 8 6 3 - 4 ) ,8 for instance, tells us that the Dingling (an ancient Turkic people) were the main inhabitants of what is now the Kazakh steppes, north of the Kangju people (a group who were situated around the city of Tashkent in what is now modern Uzbekistan) and west of the Wusun people (then situated in eastern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) by the third century AD. However, this does not mean that the ethnic composition of the Huns in Central Asia before their entry into Europe in the mid fourth century AD was exclusively Turkic. There was also an important Iranian element within their ethnic mix and this is borne out by the fact that the Central Asian Huns and the Iranian speaking Alans (the first recorded opponents of the Huns during the



Hunnic expansion west into Europe in the mid fourth century A D ) shared a very similar material culture. Both groups also practised the custom of cranial deformation (the origin of which is obscure). Archaeologically it is often very difficult to make a clear distinction between a Hun, an Alan and later even a Germanic Goth due to the intensity of cultural mixing and acculturation between all the major ethnic groups that comprised the population of the Hun Empire: Oghuric Turkic, Iranian, Germanic, etc. Just as the Xiongnu accommodated Chinese defectors into their empire, the later Huns also provided refuge for GrecoRoman defectors and also forcibly settled Roman prisoners of war in their territory. Priscus, a Roman historian and career diplomat, who visited the court of Attila the Hun as part of a Roman diplomatic mission to the Huns, leaves us with a vivid image of the heterogeneity of Hunnic society. He tells us that at the Hunnic court Hunnic (presumably Oghuric Turkic), Gothic and Latin were all spoken and all three languages were understood by most of the elite to some
degree,9 so much so that Zercon the Moor, the court jester, could provoke laughter by jumbling all three languages together at a Hunnic banquet in the presence of
Attila.10 Interestingly the Hunnic Kidarite Empire in Central Asia, which was contemporaneous with Attila’s Hunnic Empire in Europe, also used multiple languages. We know for instance that Sogdian, Bactrian, Middle Persian and
Brahmi on different occasions were all used for administrative purposes.11 In other words, any attempt to prove a genetic continuity between the Xiongnu and the Huns and any other political successor group to both empires is bound to produce mixed results, since every level of Xiongnu-Hun society was heterogeneous and most likely also multi-lingual. What matters more is the fact that the Huns of Europe and Central Asia chose to use the name of the imperial Xiongnu as their own ethnonym or state name, which is clearly an indication that they regarded this link with the old steppe, Inner Asian tradition of imperial power and grandeur invaluable and very significant. The preservation of Xiongnu cultural identity (as the preservation of Xiongnu type cauldrons all the way from the eastern steppes to the Danube represents) among the European Huns suggests that the political and cultural heritage of the Xiongnu is the key to understanding the true significance of the connections between the Xiongnu and the Huns, not the supposed racial/genetic connections. From this point onwards the book will observe consecutively the various Hunnic political groups that changed the history of Eurasia in China, Central Asia, India and Europe. Until now most histories on the Huns have tended to focus almost exclusively on the history of the European Huns alone. However, such an approach fails to illuminate sufficiently the Eurasia-wide geopolitical revolution that was the Hunnic expansion of the fourth and fifth centuries AD. Only by examining all these various Hun groups together can we truly appreciate the enormous changes brought about by the Huns to the Ancient World and by extension to the political and cultural future of the Eurasian World as a whole. These various Hunnic groups were not identical to each other culturally and politically. However, all of them could ultimately claim some form of political lineage from the great Xiongnu/Hun Empire of Inner Asia. They shared an ecumenical Inner Asian political tradition and it was primarily this political tradition that they bequeathed to their respective conquests. Due to the lack of space available it is not possible to give a detailed summary



of all the relevant primary and secondary sources used and consulted in this book. However, where necessary short explanations will be given to explain the provenance and importance of the most significant primary sources pertaining to the Huns in the individual chapters that follow. Map 0.1 also provides the geographical location of the various regions and peoples affected by the history described in this book. Because of the vast geographical extent of Hunnic Empires in Eurasia the reader will unfortunately encounter a veritable tsunami of unfamiliar proper names associated with the Huns and their conquests throughout this book. As in this introduction, where relevant in the individual chapters, short descriptions of these unfamiliar names will be provided to help the reader navigate his or her way through the deluge.

1 LaVaissiere (2005), 11-15. 2 Pulleyblank (2000a), 6 0 -1 , upon examination of phonetic evidence concludes that there is no alternative but to accept that the European Huns had the same name as the Xiongnu. De Crespigny (1984), 174, agrees. See also Atwood (2012), 27-52, who via a slightly different interpretation of the available phonetic evidence arrives at the same conclusion, that the Huns are the Xiongnu. See also

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE XIONGNU HUNS
Any discussion on the Huns must first begin with the story of the mighty Xiongnu, the original Huns of Inner Asia. The Xiongnu Empire is in many cases called a ‘nomadic’ empire or confederacy. Actually, as we will see later on in this chapter, in the discussion on Xiongnu archaeology, it was in reality an agro
pastoralist society, not purely nomadic.1 It is hotly debated among scholars whether this ‘nomadic’ Xiongnu constituted a state or simply a super-complex
tribal confederacy with imperial dimensions.2 Underlying this debate is the assumption among some scholars that ‘nomadism’ is an insurmountable barrier to organized statehood. However, as explained earlier in the introduction, ‘nomadism’ or rather pastoralism by no means implies a lack of fixed boundaries or less organizational capacity. The existence of well-defined territories and regular movements under an authoritative leader was essential for the survival of
the ‘nomadic’ tribal community in a very fragile ecological environment.3 Therefore, we must first of all dismiss the erroneous preconception that ‘nomadism’ means political anarchy. What is not at all in dispute is the fact that the political organization of the Xiongnu provided an excellent model on which
all subsequent steppe political entities built their ‘confederacies’ or ‘states’.4 Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine in some detail the political organization of the Xiongnu, which in all likelihood influenced also the later Hunnic political systems in Central Asia and Europe. Much of the dispute regarding the nature of Xiongnu political organization arises from the differing understanding among scholars of what actually constitutes a ‘state’ and an ‘empire’. The Russian scholar Kradin has argued that a state should have the following characteristics:
1. access to managerial positions by a form of merit-based, extra-clan and nonkin-based selection; 2. regular taxation to pay wages to officials; 3. a special judicial power separate from political power; 4. a ‘class’ of state functionaries engaged in running a state machinery consisting of services for the administration of the whole political community.
Each of these criteria is obviously debatable and it is to be wondered whether this definition of the state is too modernist and not nearly as relevant to or appropriate in defining pre-early-modern states. However that may be, Kradin assumes that based on these criteria the Xiongnu achieved ‘statehood’, at best, merely at an
‘embryonic’ level and therefore should not be categorized as a state.5 A much



looser and perhaps more appropriate definition of the state is provided by Kräder,
who argues that all steppe empires of Eurasia were actually state-level polities.6 However, for the sake of clarity it will be examined henceforth whether the Xiongnu by Kradin’s definition constituted a state or simply a complex chiefdom. According to the Chinese source Shiji by the renowned historian Sima Qian (a historian of the Chinese Han dynasty (2 0 6 B C - 2 2 0 A D )) the Xiongnu political system was a highly centralized ‘autocracy’, a complex hierarchy descending from the emperor (called Shanyu/Chanyu) to lesser kings and sub-kings. It was a
structure that has been described as essentially ‘quasi-feudal’.7 Sima Qian writes:
Under the Shan-yii8 are the Wise Kings of the Left and Right, the left and right Lu-li kings, left and right generals, left and right commandants, left and right household administrators, and left and right Ku-tu marquises. The Hsiung-nu word for ‘wise’ is ‘t ’u-ch’i’, so that the heir of the Shan-yii is customarily called the ‘T ’u-ch’i King of the Left’. Among the other leaders, from the wise kings on down to the household administrators, the more important ones command ten thousand horsemen and the lesser ones several thousand, numbering twenty-four leaders in all, though all are known by the title ‘Ten Thousand Horsemen’. The high ministerial offices are hereditary, being filled from generation to generation by the members of the Hu-yen and Lan families, and in more recent times by the Hsü-pu family. These three families constitute the aristocracy of the nation. The kings and other leaders of the left live in the eastern sector, the region from Shang-ku east to the land of the Hui-mo and the Ch’aohsien peoples. The kings and leaders of the right live in the west, the area from Shang province west to the territories of the Yüeh-chi and Ch’iang tribes. The Shan-yii has his court in the region of Tai and Yün-chung. Each group has its own area, within which it moves about from place to place looking for water and pasture. The Left and Right Wise Kings and the Lu-li kings are the most powerful, while the Ku-tu marquises assist the Shan-yii in the administration of the nation. Each of the twenty-four leaders in turn appoint his own ‘chiefs of a thousand’, ‘chiefs of a hundred’, and ‘chiefs of ten’, as well as his subordinate kings, prime ministers, chief commandants, household administrators, chii-ch’U officials and so forth.
(Shiji 110: 9b -10b )9
What this record shows is that the Xiongnu constructed their administrative system in the following way. The supreme power within the system lay with the emperor, the Shanyu ( I p T -, also sometimes transliterated as Chanyu, but likely to have been pronounced dan-wa, representing the Xiongnu word darywa in Early Middle Chinese (ancient Chinese used during the Han dynasty and Late
Antiquity)).10 The Shanyu was the recognized head of the central government. The actual administrative tasks within the central government, however, were handled by the so-called gu-du marquesses who also coordinated the affairs of the empire as a whole and managed communications with governors and vassals on behalf of the emperor. Under the control of this central government were four principal, regional governorships in the east and west (also called the ‘horns’): the Worthy King of the Left and the Luli King of the Left in the east, and the Worthy King of the Right and the Luli King of the Right in the west. Each of these four governorships in
turn had its own government bureaucracy11 and the kings, who were usually the sons or brothers of the reigning Shanyu/Chanyu (emperor), were the highest ranking aristocrats in the Xiongnu Empire. Incidentally the practice of four pre eminent sub-kings ruling under a supreme king is also found among the later Volga Bulgars (Hunnic descendants who established a state in what is now roughly the Tatarstan Republic of the Russian Federation) and also among the
Göktürks who succeed the Huns and the Rouran12 as masters of the eastern



steppes. When we combine Sima Qian’s information with the information we find in a later source the Hou Hanshu (recording the history of the second half of the Han dynasty; Sima Qian himself was active in the first half during the first century B C ), we learn a little bit more about the upper tier of Xiongnu administrative hierarchy, that there was apparently also a supreme aristocratic council of six top ranking nobles. This council included the so-called ‘Rizhu kings’ of the Left and Right, which were titles originally only given to the sons and younger brothers of the Shanyu (Hou Hanshu 79. 2944). However, later as the Xiongnu political system evolved, these titles were transferred to the aristocratic Huyan clan, which was related to the royal family by marriage. The other four nobles making up the council were the Wenyuti kings of the Left and Right, and the Zhanjiang Kings of the Left and Right. The Hou Hanshu calls these Lords the six corners or horns. It has been suggested that this hierarchy and the political ranks of aristocratic and ruling clans may have changed somewhat between the time of Sima Qian (earlier Han period) and the later Han period (first-third century A D ). By the time of the later Han dynasty the empire of the Xiongnu had splintered into two separate entities, the Northern and Southern Xiongnu. What the Hou Hanshu describes therefore (about the six horn nobles, etc.) may be a reference to political innovation among the Southern Xiongnu (who were allied to the Chinese) rather than the exact old Xiongnu system of governance. However, it is clear that these later developments, if they were of any significance, in any case derived from the political traditions of the original Xiongnu Empire or it may simply be that the Han Chinese had a better understanding of the Xiongnu political system by this time and elaborated on the original description of Xiongnu political organization
left in the Shiji by Sima Qian.13 Below these ten top-ranking nobles (or including these ten) there were the 24 imperial leaders/ministers (each titled Ten Thousand Horsemen), who seem to have been the imperial governors of the key, major provinces of the Xiongnu Empire. These lords again consisted of the close relatives of the Shanyu/Chanyu or members of the Xiongnu aristocracy that were related to the royal house. These senior nobles were divided into eastern and western groups in a dual system and the designated successor to the Xiongnu imperial throne was usually appointed the Wise King of the Left, who was the titular ruler of the eastern half of the political unit. All political appointments were tightly controlled by the reigning emperor (the Shanyu) in order to strengthen the power of the central government vis-a-vis the provinces and the periphery. At the bottom of this complex administrative hierarchy was a large group of subordinate or vassal tribal leaders (labelled in the Shiji sub-kings, prime
ministers, chief commandants, household administrators, chü-cWü officials etc.). These officials were under the control of the 24 imperial governors, but at times
enjoyed a level of local autonomy.14 Some former rulers of conquered peoples were also allowed to remain sub-kings/chiefs under appropriate Xiongnu oversight and over-kings. For the government of the more distant western parts of their territory the Xiongnu created the office curiously titled the ‘Commandant in charge of Slaves’, which under the overlordship of a Xiongnu sub-king had the power to tax minor states such as Karashar and Kalmagan (in what is now



Xinjiang province in western China) and to conscript corvee labour. In addition certain Chinese defectors were also appointed sub-kings, e.g. Wei Lu as king of the Ding Ling people and Lu Wan as king of the Donghu people. However, the upper echelons of power and positions of political, administrative and military importance close to the Shanyu/Chanyu and key strategic areas were almost exclusively reserved for members of the imperial clan and a few select Xiongnu aristocratic families. A non-decimal system of ranks was used for the political administration of tribes and territory within the empire during peacetime and these included groups of many different sizes. However, a tighter system of decimal ranks (thousands, hundreds, tens, etc.) was used in wartime when large-scale armies were formed from troops conscripted from different parts of the empire under a single
command structure.15 A census was also taken to determine the empire’s reserve
of manpower and livestock.16 Chinese sources report that Modu, the first pre eminent Shanyu/Chanyu, had annexed some 26 states north and west of China and had reduced them all to complete obedience as constituent parts of the Xiongnu nation. In war the Shanyu could reputedly mobilize an army of 140,000
men from among his subjects.17 What all this shows is that Kradin’s reluctance to define the Xiongnu as a state is quite unwarranted. As Di Cosmo points out the Xiongnu Empire even by Kradin’s rigid definition was much more similar to a well-organized state than a loosely controlled chiefdom. The Xiongnu administration possessed distinct military and civilian apparatuses separate from kin-based hierarchies. Top commanders and functionaries received their wages (in various forms) from a political centre headed by the Xiongnu emperor (Shanyu/Chanyu), who was also in charge of ceremonies and rituals that were meant to include the entire political community, not just his kin group. The incredibly complex organization of Xiongnu armies, its imperial rituals, government structure and politically centralized functions of trade and diplomacy all bear witness to what Di Cosmo
calls a political machinery and supratribal, imperial ideology.18 Kradin himself concedes that special judicial manpower (i.e. judges) was also available in the Xiongnu Empire and that there were special state functionaries (gu-du marquesses) who assisted the emperor in the overall administration of the
empire.19 Therefore, the Xiongnu Empire can in all probability be defined as a
state or an ‘early state’ entity.20 Also, there can be absolutely no doubt at all that the Xiongnu constituted an empire,
a political formation that extended far beyond its original territorial or ethnic confines and embraced, by direct conquest or by the imposition of its political authority, a variety of peoples and lands that may have had different types of relations with the imperial center, constituted by an imperial clan and by its charismatic leader.21
On this point the vast majority of Xiongnu experts, including Kradin are in full agreement. Another important aspect of Xiongnu political organization is the degree to which the Xiongnu absorbed and adapted neighbouring Chinese practices with regard to their state organization and administration. The putative Chinese



influence on the Xiongnu is rejected by some scholars who see the resemblances and similarities between Xiongnu and Chinese administrative and cultural practices to be largely the result of a shared set of associations that may go back to
a more ancient cultural stratum.22 However, the essentially quasi-feudal character of the Xiongnu Empire with its complex hierarchy of kings and marquesses, the highest ranks of which were reserved exclusively for members of the royal clan and the lesser ranks for leaders of other leading clans that intermarried with the
royal clan,23 shows striking similarities to the distribution of kingdoms and marquisates within the Han imperial system, but with obviously clear differences in functions. The Xiongnu territorial divisions which favoured the left, i.e. the east (when viewed with orientation towards the south in the Chinese manner or right when viewed with orientation towards the north in the steppe manner) over the west may conceivably reflect the influence of Chinese ideas which identified the left (east) with the yang (as in yinyang) forces of generation and growth. The use of colours as symbolism for territory, blue for east, white for west, black for north and red for south, also correspond to the symbolism of Chinese cosmology
(Wuxing, five elements theory).24 One last factor which we must take note of before we leave behind the question of Xiongnu political organization is its connections with earlier forms of political organization in the Eurasian steppes. There have long been suggestions that the Scythians/Saka in the western steppes, an Iranian speaking people who flourished between the eighth and fourth centuries BC, had a cultural impact on the
Xiongnu.25 There is also some evidence of similarities/affinities between the political systems of the two groups as well. The fifth century Greek historian Herodotus recounts a Scythian legend in which the principal components of the Scythian polity are divided into three parts (Hdt. 4.7). This is strikingly similar to the tripartite division of power among the leading tribes/clans, which characterized the Xiongnu form of government. The Xiongnu system featured three aristocratic clans linked via family/marriage ties to the Shanyu/Chanyu: the Huyan, Lan and Xubu (the imperial clan was the Xulianti/Luanti clan which descended from the early Shanyus Touman and Modu), which constituted the ruling, upper class of Xiongnu society. These ruling clans, along with the royal
family, led separate sub-divisions of steppe peoples26 in ways reminiscent of the three Scythian divisions. Just as the Xiongnu had a ruling Xulianti clan, the Scythians were also headed by the so-called Royal Scythians who held supremacy over all other groups of Scythians. The taking of the census by the Scythian king Ariantes, reported by Herodotus (4.81), also shows that there were already steppe models of taxation and labour exploitation available for the Xiongnu to adapt to their purposes without even needing to seek out Chinese alternatives. The proximity of these Scythians/Saka to the Xiongnu is also worth considering. According to archaeological excavations from Arzhan in Tuva, northwest of Mongolia (the core territory of the Xiongnu), remains dating from the Scythian period (eighth century B C ) have revealed the existence of highly organized steppe polities in Central Asia that corroborate Herodotus’ observations. A large-scale Scythian/Saka type tomb that consisted of 70 chambers and contained 160 saddle horses buried together with a Saka king demonstrates the existence of a well-organized steppe



confederacy under the rule of a powerful monarch, long before the rise of the Xiongnu Empire. That this Saka king ruled over a more or less typical steppe hierarchical state or quasi-state entity is confirmed by the fact that subordinate princes or nobles were buried to the north, south and west of the king and his
wife.27 The roots of complex political organization in the steppes are therefore revealed to have been truly ancient. The Xiongnu and the later Huns did not arise out of nothing. In the western parts of the Eurasian steppes (today’s Ukraine and southern Russia), after the demise of the Scythians, the Scythian political tradition was continued by the largely Iranian language speaking Sarmatians and Alans
(considered a sub-branch of the Sarmatians).28 In comparison with the contemporaneous Xiongnu however, these western counterparts of the Xiongnu were somewhat more fragmented and poorly organized. According to Strabo (a Greco-Roman geographer from the late first century BC to early first century A D ), before they became fragmented, the Sarmatians possessed a more centralized organization. He reports the existence of a ruling royal tribe which was situated in the centre of the Sarmatian tribal confederacy/empire that had around it a protective ring of vassal tribes (Iazyges to the south, Urgi to the north and the
Roxolani to the east).29 The Alans further to the east, like the more westerly Sarmatians in the second century BC, also possessed a royal clan and regiments of professional warriors in
the Scythian manner (presumably in the usual decimal system).30 In their heydays Strabo would report that King Spadinus of the Aorsi (probably the Alans or a group later linked to the Alans) could marshal an army of 200,000 men (Strabo 11.5.8). A gross exaggeration without doubt, but nonetheless highlighting the power of these steppe peoples. The kings of the Alans, like the Scythian king Ariantes of old, carried out a general census of male warriors. An inscription discovered at Olbia also bears witness to their observance of the steppe custom of collective or joint rule among brothers who are referred to as the ‘greatest kings of
Aorsia’.31 Furthermore, the Alans seem to have possessed a ranking system in much the same way as the earlier Scythians and the contemporaneous Xiongnu. The Alans also used colour to designate segments of their tribal confederation in much the same way as the Xiongnu. Thus we find Ptolemy (3.15.3, Alemany (2000), 8) referring to the white (hapax) Alans. What all this shows is that the political system of the early Xiongnu evolved out of a milieu rather than in isolation and that other steppe polities also possessed a capacity for political organization that resembled the organization that we find among the Xiongnu. This fact will be of particular importance when we later discuss the political organization and nature of the Hunnic Empires in Central Asia and Europe.

POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE XIONGNU HUNS
The Xiongnu according to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, mentioned above,
originated in the Ordos region in what is now Inner Mongolia.32 After making the usual spurious claim that the Xiongnu like other foreign peoples around China were descended from a Chinese cultural hero in the mythical past, Sima Qian in the opening section of the Xiongnu liezhuan (the chapter on the Xiongnu in the
Shiji) lists the names by which the Xiongnu were known to the Chinese before the unification of China in the third century BC. Before the third century BC the Xiongnu Huns were called Chunwei, Shanrong, Xianyun and Xunyu (the last ethnonym probably pronounced Hün-yü), he tells us. Scholars had earlier identified the names Chunwei and Xunyu with the later name Hun with good reason and their excellent conjectures seem increasingly more likely to be correct given the new evidence on the identification of the name Xiongnu with Hun outlined above. Sima Qian equates the later Xiongnu of his time (first century BC ) with these earlier enemies of China, who are collectively called the Rongdi (western and northern ‘barbarians’). A group called the Quanrong (literally ‘dog martial people’) in particular, who Sima Qian seems to identify with the early Xiongnu, are said to have been responsible for the capture of the Chinese Western Zhou (ca. 1046-771 BC, the then ruling dynasty of the Zhongyuan (the central plains that later became the core of the Chinese Empire)) capital of Haojing around 770 BC. This catastrophe forced the Chinese to abandon their western territories and flee east.



The forebears of the Xiongnu Huns, according to Sima Qian, continued to menace China for centuries until the Chinese eventually got the better of them. The Xiongnu Huns were expelled from their homeland in the Ordos region (modern Inner Mongolia in northern China) by the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi, the infamously cruel tyrant who unified China in 221 BC. Qin Shi Huangdi erected the famous Great Wall in order to ward off Hu (nomadic barbarian) invaders from the north and to secure his own territories. Tens of thousands of labourers are said to have perished in order to build the wall. However, the glory of Qin (the state-name from which the modern name China is thought to derive) turned out to be short-lived. The dynasty collapsed in the midst of chaotic rebellion and China descended into a period of anarchy. The Xiongnu under their king Touman (the first Xiongnu ruler whose name appears in the historical record) were able to capitalize on this disorder to make a comeback and reoccupy the Ordos region. At this stage the Xiongnu Huns were only one among many steppe confederacies competing with each other for dominance in the eastern steppes. They were sandwiched between two more powerful Inner Asian steppe peoples: the proto-Mongolic Donghu to the east and the Indo-European Yuezhi to the west. It is in this historical context that the first great conqueror of steppe history emerged onto the annals of Inner Asian history. Modu Chanyu (Shanyu), whose name according to the Early Middle Chinese reading would have approximated the common Turco-Mongol name or title Bagatur (hero), was born as the eldest son of the Xiongnu Shanyu/Chanyu Touman. According to the legend of his rise to power related in Sima Qian’s Shiji, Modu was the unwanted son of a former wife whom Touman, the Xiongnu king, wished to dispose of in order to secure the succession for his favourite son by another wife. The evil father (or maybe uncle given the possibility of collateral succession to the throne among the Xiongnu and other Inner Asian peoples) is said to have plotted the death of the young hero, sending him as a hostage to the neighbouring Yuezhi and then starting a war with the Yuezhi in order to provoke the Yuezhi to slay the unwanted son. However, Modu’s destiny was to survive and become the first ruler of a unified Inner Asian world. He escaped the trap set by his sinister father by stealing a horse from the Yuezhi and made his way back to the Xiongnu. Touman was forced to recognize his son’s bravery and he appointed Modu the general of 10,000 horsemen. Modu immediately proceeded to secure his position by gaining the absolute obedience of his men. He instructed his men to all shoot their arrows at targets he would set for them and executed anyone who dared to disobey. The targets progressively became more provocative: Modu’s favourite horse, his favourite wife, then the horse of his father, the reigning Chanyu. After securing the absolute fidelity of his men through drastic measures, Modu carried out a merciless coup and assassinated his father by subjecting him to a hail of arrows from his disciplined troops. This was only the beginning of Modu’s reign of terror. He then ordered the execution of his half-brothers, step-mother and any members of the Xiongnu aristocracy who opposed him. The brutal purge was then followed by an encounter with the formidable Donghu confederacy to the east. The Donghu in order to test the ability of the new Chanyu sent an ambassador to Modu demanding that the Xiongnu hand over the late Touman’s great warhorse. All the



Xiongnu nobles begged Modu to reject the impertinent request, but to everyone’s surprise the indomitable Modu gave up the horse described as the ‘treasure’ of the Xiongnu to the Donghu without a second thought. The Donghu became even more insolent and demanded that Modu surrender one of his wives to them. Again Modu complied against the protests of his nobles who wanted to resist. The Donghu were by now contemptuous of the Xiongnu Chanyu and without organizing any proper defences they went on to demand from the Xiongnu the barren wasteland between them and the Xiongnu nation. The Xiongnu nobles who had earlier seen their king give up the great horse and favourite woman without resistance thought that giving up some useless land would not be a big deal and advised Modu to comply with the Donghu request as before. At this Modu suddenly flew into a rage. Horses and women can be sacrificed for peace, but land is the foundation of the state he declared. He immediately ordered the execution of all the officials who had advised the surrender of territory and swiftly launched an all-out war against the unsuspecting Donghu. The Donghu who had been fooled by Modu’s deception were overwhelmed and incorporated into the Xiongnu Empire. Modu followed up this victory by defeating also the powerful Yuezhi to the west. Victory followed victory and the Xiongnu Huns went on to recover all the territory in the south that they had lost to the Chinese under the Qin dynasty. In the north Modu campaigned successfully against tribes such as the Hunyu and the Dingling. For the first time in history all of eastern Inner Asia was united under the banner of a single imperial state. Sima Qian notes that the Xiongnu lords and officials realized that Modu was wise and capable and rendered him complete obedience. The standing army of the Xiongnu also expanded to 300,000 men, a match for the mighty armies of Han China. Modu then achieved his greatest triumph in 200 BC at Ping Cheng where he defeated and surrounded the army of Emperor Gaozu of the recently established Han dynasty of China. Gaozu had to buy his freedom by submitting to humiliating terms. He was forced to surrender one of his daughters as the concubine of the Xiongnu Chanyu (Gaozu sent a relative instead after lying to the Xiongnu that the girl was indeed his daughter). The Han Chinese agreed to pay an annual tribute consisting of silk, wine, grain and other foodstuffs to the Chanyu as well to placate this powerful northern adversary. Han China had in effect become a tributary state dependent on the good will of the Xiongnu Empire. When Gaozu died Modu sent an insulting letter to the empress dowager of Han China, suggesting that she become one of his wives. The Empress reacted with anger and asked her officials if a punitive expedition could be launched against the Xiongnu. To this belligerent talk Han officials replied that not even the wise and martial Gaozu could defeat the Xiongnu, but suffered the humiliating debacle at Ping Cheng. The empress relented and sent a humble letter to the Chanyu asking for the latter’s indulgence, explaining to him that she was unfit to be the wife of the Chanyu due to old age and deteriorating physical condition. To wrap up she reminded the Chanyu that her country had done nothing wrong and begged the
Xiongnu emperor to spare it (Han Shu, 94A: 5a).33 During the early years of the subsequent reign of China’s Han Wendi (179-57 BC) Modu again scored a decisive victory over the Yuezhi and conquered the Tarim basin (modern Xinjiang) and a total of 26 nations to the west including the



powerful Wusun nation (eastern Kazakhstan). Wendi decided that the Xiongnu were too formidable to provoke and renewed the payment of tribute paid during the times of Emperor Gaozu and Empress Dowager Lu. The tribute was in fact increased to 1,000 pieces of gold a year (Han Shu, 94B:12b). Modu died in 174 BC and was able to pass on the imperial throne to his son Laoshang without any political disturbance. Such was his influence and authority over the Xiongnu. In a remarkable reign that lasted 35 years the great Modu Chanyu founded the Xiongnu Empire, reorganized the system of governance of the Xiongnu and greatly expanded the boundaries of the state so that it was now larger than the famous empire of Alexander the Great. Modu had also subjected an equally large empire of China to the payment of tribute. Modu was in many ways Alexander’s equal, maybe even superior when it comes to the extent of his conquests. The two rulers were also similar in that they were both suspected of having assassinated their fathers (Touman and Philip) in order to seize the throne. Modu, however, was clearly the more competent politican and administrator of the two. While Alexander’s empire collapsed and splintered right after his death, Modu’s Hunnic Xiongnu Empire would last a further 400 years under the rule of Modu’s direct descendants. Alexander’s death not only led to the end of his empire, but also the extinction of his royal house. After Modu’s death his legacy was inherited by his chosen heir the new Chanyu Laoshang. Under Laoshang the Xiongnu defeated the Yuezhi once again in 162 BC and turned the skull of the defeated Yuezhi king into a drinking cup (Shiji 123.3162). The Yuezhi who had already been pushed as far west as the Zhetysu region (in modern eastern Kazakhstan) now had to flee even further west into Greco-Bactrian territory. The Greco-Bactrians were the successors of Alexander’s Greeks and Macedonians in modern Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. The newly conquered lands in modern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were awarded by the Xiongnu emperor to the Wusun people who had rendered valuable service to the Xiongnu in the latest war against the Yuezhi. The Chinese to the south of the Xiongnu Empire remained in awe of the power of the Xiongnu and for nearly 70 years until 134 BC the Han Chinese paid regular tribute to first Modu, then Laoshang and finally to Gunchen Chanyu. However, the accession of the more militant Emperor Wu (the ‘martial’ emperor) to the Han throne in 141 AD brought about a revision of the so-called heqin (appeasement) policy towards the Xiongnu by the Chinese. Emperor Wu authorized a plan in 134 BC to lure Gunchen Chanyu and the Xiongnu army into a Han ambush. The plan failed, however, and five years later in 129 BC full-scale war erupted between the Xiongnu and the Han Empire. Somewhat remarkably during this war the Han Chinese forces for the first time held their own against the powerful Xiongnu mobile armies and even managed to inflict defeats (usually pyrrhic and costly) on individual Xiongnu armies. The Han Chinese endeavour to take back lost territory from the Xiongnu and also to expand west was aided by the first major political disturbance since Modu within the Xiongnu system. Gunchen Chanyu died in 126 BC in the early stages of the war between the Xiongnu Huns and Han China. After Gunchen’s death, his brother Ichise usurped the throne from Gunchen’s heir, the wise king of the left Yui Bi. Yui Bi, facing defeat at the hands of Ichise, surrendered to the Han and Wudi took full advantage of this civil strife among the Xiongnu by reoccupying the



Ordos region which Touman Chanyu almost a century earlier had reconquered for the Xiongnu. The usurpation of Ichise Chanyu had other repercussions. Xiongnu sub-kings in the Gansu region (part of western China) after being defeated by invading Han armies chose to defect to Han China rather than face punishment at the hands of the vengeful Ichise Chanyu. The defection of key Xiongnu lords shows that there were rifts among the Xiongnu aristocracy, the cause of which was clearly Ichise’s illegal usurpation of the throne. The two empires continued to battle one another for the next half a century until 60 BC when the Han routed the Xiongnu and secured complete, albeit temporary, control over all of the Tarim basin (modern day Xinjiang). The defeats suffered by the Xiongnu during the long war also triggered rebellion against the Xiongnu by former vassal peoples such as the Wusun. In 72 BC the Wusun mounted a devastatingly successful raid against the Xiongnu from the west. In the following year in 71 BC formerly vassal peoples to the north the Dingling and the Wuhuan to the east joined together with the Wusun in assaulting the Xiongnu from all sides. The breakdown of Xiongnu control over vassal peoples was also partly due to a leadership crisis in the central Xiongnu government and the growth of regionalism within the empire. Between 114 BC and 58 BC the Xiongnu enthroned a total of eight short-lived Chanyus, of which only two reigned for more than ten years. Factional conflict at court, sometimes triggered by regional power struggles, undermined the ability of the Xiongnu central government to effectively quell internal rebellions and beat off Han invasions from the south. The principle of primogeniture among the early Xiongnu Chanyus which saw the imperial throne pass from father to son, an indication of the overwhelming authority held by the reigning Chanyu and a distinct oddity in steppe societies, increasingly became incompatible with the usual steppe practice of tanistry and collateral succession to the throne. By 57 BC the strife over the imperial succession produced five regional contenders, all vying for the title of Chanyu. By 54 BC just two of the five contenders were left in place, Zhizhi in the north and Huhanye in the south. Huhanye was hard pressed by Zhizhi and in order to improve his chances of success, he decided to do the unthinkable: submit to the Han Empire and agree to become a vassal of the Chinese emperor. Thus, in a full reversal of the situation earlier in history where the Han emperor was a virtual vassal of the Xiongnu Chanyu, the Xiongnu ruler now accepted secondary status below that of the Han emperor. Huhanye paid homage to the Han emperor in Changan, the Chinese capital, and for this act of subservience he was given Han money and military support against the defiant Zhizhi. By 36 BC Huhanye with a combined force of Xiongnu and Han troops managed to defeat Zhizhi completely. Zhizhi’s supporters followed their defeated lord all the way to Uzbekistan (the land of the Kangju people) in the west where Zhizhi met his tragic end. The humiliation of the Xiongnu Huns, however, would not last indefinitely. Just 40 years after the humiliating reign of Huhanye the Han dynasty was displaced by the short-lived Xin dynasty of the usurper Wang Mang. A Han restoration movement began almost immediately and China descended into civil war. The Xiongnu took full advantage and restored their rule over rebellious vassal peoples such as the Wuhuan in the east and recaptured lost territories in the west, most notably the Tarim basin. The resurgent Xiongnu demanded from the Han treatment that they had enjoyed under Modu and declared triumphantly that



the tributary relationship between the Han and Xiongnu should now be reversed again with the Chanyu as the superior of the Han Chinese emperor. Unfortunately for the Xiongnu Huns, at this juncture in their long history, frictions within the Xiongnu elite were reaching levels that soon tore apart the empire into two halves. In 46 AD Punu was declared the Chanyu of the empire in the north, but in the south eight breakaway tribes and their nobility proclaimed another pretender Bi as the Chanyu, who like Huhanye before him sought Chinese aid to counter his northern rival. This time the division of the Xiongnu into northern and southern groups would be permanent. In 50 AD Bi sent his son to Luoyang, the new Chinese capital of the restored Han dynasty, as a sign of Xiongnu submission to the Han Empire. His group of Southern Xiongnu actually entered Chinese territory and became federates of the Chinese along the imperial border between Han China and the Xiongnu, much like the Germanic Franks along the borders of the Western Roman Empire in the early years of the fifth century AD, whom we will encounter later on in the book. The Southern Xiongnu descendants within China, who tenaciously held on to their Xiongnu identity, would have a glorious future ahead of them. However, their cousins the Northern Xiongnu in the traditional centre of the Xiongnu Empire in Mongolia proper were facing insurmountable problems. Inner Mongolia to the south was permanently lost to the Southern Xiongnu who had Chinese support. In 73-4 AD the Chinese snatched the Tarim basin and other western territories away from the Northern Xiongnu as well. The Dingling in the north again rose up in rebellion. The rise of the Mongolic Xianbei to the east, however, proved to be the greatest threat. The Xianbei (in Early Middle Chinese pronounced Serbi) were former vassals of the Xiongnu, but now they allied themselves with the Chinese against their former masters. In 87 AD the Xianbei inflicted a massive defeat on the Northern Xiongnu, killed the reigning Chanyu and flayed his body. Fifty-eight Xiongnu tribes then deserted to the Han Empire. Further disasters then befell the beleaguered Northern Xiongnu in 89 AD when the Chinese general Dou Xian defeated the Chanyu in Mongolia and killed 13,000 Xiongnu soldiers along with many high-ranking nobles. Some 81 Xiongnu tribes consisting of 200,000 people are said to have surrendered to the Han on that occasion. Just two years later in 91 AD another crippling defeat in the southern range of the Altai mountains virtually ended the Xiongnu Empire and its control over Mongolia and the Tarim basin. The last known Chanyu of the Northern Xiongnu in Chinese records is said to have retreated in the direction of the Ili basin in eastern Kazakhstan. This was by no means the end of the Xiongnu in Inner Asia and the Xiongnu would remain in the Altai region (an area in the very heart of Inner Asia, currently divided between Mongolia, China, Kazakhstan and Russia) until the middle of the third century AD when they are again mentioned by a Chinese source, the Weilue. However, their hegemony over Mongolia and the eastern steppes was now taken over by the Xianbei. For two centuries the Xiongnu Huns of the Altai would remain in a state of virtual siege with the Turkic Dingling to the northeast and northwest, Kangju to the west, Xianbei to the east and Wusun to the southwest. Only after this long period of relative obscurity would they re-emerge as the mighty Huns in the annals of history.



MAP 1.1 Xiongnu Hun Empire
SOUTHERN XIONGNU AND XIANBEI CONQUEST OF CHINA
After the collapse of the Xiongnu Empire in 91 AD the paramount position of the Xiongnu Huns in the eastern steppes was taken over by the Xianbei. These Xianbei, however, in large part failed to replicate the success of the Xiongnu in
unifying all the tribes of the eastern steppes into a supratribal proto-state entity.34 Only briefly under the charismatic leadership of the remarkable Tanshihuai (14181 AD) did the Xianbei achieve the imperial scope of the Xiongnu. Tanshihuai defeated the Dingling to the north, Buyeo to the east, the Wusun to the west and checked the Han Chinese to the south, thereby almost recreating the Xiongnu Empire at its height. After his death the Xianbei Empire again fragmented into lesser hordes, but these Xianbei remained strong enough to prevent any comeback by either the Southern or Northern Xiongnu and presented a persistent menace to China’s northern borders.

The Xiongnu Empire disintegrates, Northern Xiongnu reside mainly in the Altai region until the fourth century AD, Southern Xiongnu dwell in the Ordos region in Chinese territory
The Southern Xiongnu, hemmed in between the Xianbei-Wuhuan tribes to the north and east and the Chinese Empire to the south, could do little to expand their influence in the second century AD. However, the situation started to change in the third century AD. In the first half of the third century AD the Han Empire splintered into three warring kingdoms and general anarchy prevailed in much of the northern outlying provinces of China. The Southern Xiongnu were growing in size and influence and this drew the attention of Cao Cao, the military dictator who founded the new Wei dynasty in northern China. In order to keep the Xiongnu in line Cao Cao in 216 AD had the Southern Xiongnu Chanyu remain in the Chinese capital as a hostage while the Chanyu’s brother the Wise King of the Right was given the task of ruling the Xiongnu in the Chanyu’s absence. The Southern Xiongnu were furthermore split into five divisions, each with its own leader and a corresponding Chinese overseer. The fact that the imperial organization of the Southern Xiongnu remained intact and was still functioning despite the Xiongnu’s long sojourne in Chinese border territory was troubling to the Chinese authorities. The measures mentioned above were taken to suppress the Xiongnu’s capacity for independent action and also to easily tap into Xiongnu manpower for Cao Wei’s wars within China. The Wei dynasty of the Cao family was soon replaced by the Jin dynasty of the Sima clan that proceeded to reunify all of China by the middle of the third century AD. However, the policy of keeping the Xiongnu Chanyu as hostage in Luoyang proved to be ineffective and the humiliating treatment given to the Xiongnu by the Chinese antagonized the Xiongnu Huns beyond endurance and set the stage for a terrible revenge in the early years of the following fourth century AD. A series of internal civil wars seriously weakened the cohesion of the Jin Chinese Empire from 292 AD onwards and the Xiongnu took this opportunity to finally throw off the Chinese yoke and take charge. In 304 AD the Southern Xiongnu under Liu Yuan, a direct descendant of Modu Chanyu, declared their independence from the Chinese and the new Great Chanyu, who in his early years had lived as a hostage at the Jin Chinese court and was familiar with Chinese practices, declared that he was not only the ruler of the Xiongnu, but also the legitimate successor of the old Han dynasty of China (by virtue of his descent from imperial Han princesses, hence his use of the surname Liu, the surname of Han emperors). In 308 AD with over 50,000 Xiongnu troops behind him Liu Yuan declared himself emperor of China and thus began the



period of the ‘sixteen kingdoms’ of the Wuhu (the five barbarian peoples) when a unique synthesis of steppe, Inner Asian political traditions and Chinese administrative practices occurred to produce what later became the imperial system of the medieval Sui-Tang Empires of China. Liu Yuan through his military and political talents gradually gained the support of not just his core Xiongnu, but also ‘barbarian’ lords such as Shi Le of the Jie (a tribe so closely connected with the Xiongnu that they were often considered to be Xiongnu) and Chinese renegade warlords such as Wang Mi. Through these vassals and his nephew and eventual successor Liu Cong, Liu Yuan gained control of much of modern day Shanxi province and launched repeated attacks on the Jin Chinese capital of Luoyang. He died just a year before the final triumph of the Southern Xiongnu over Jin China. Upon his death in 310 AD his son Liu He ascended the throne for just a week before being toppled by Liu Cong. Liu Cong, after seizing the Xiongnu throne by force of arms, continued the assault on Luoyang, which finally fell to the Xiongnu in 311 AD. The Jin Emperor Huai was taken prisoner, the Chinese capital burnt to the ground and Liu Cong granted the defeated Chinese ruler the title of Duke of Kuaiji. The fall of the Chinese Empire was complete and the Xiongnu took revenge for nearly two centuries of humiliation at the hands of the Chinese. Five years after the fall of Luoyang the Xiongnu took Changan, the second capital of the Jin dynasty, in 316 AD and captured a second Jin Chinese emperor who was given the insulting rank of marquess before being disposed of like the former Jin emperor captured in 311 AD. Both Jin emperors were subjected to the indignity of having to serve the Xiongnu emperor as butlers before their eventual execution. Jin remnants fled south to the Yangtze region and established there the so-called Eastern Jin state in exile. With the exception of Gansu province in the west controlled by the state of Liang and the Xianbei controlled areas in the northeast, all of northern China from eastern Gansu to Shandong province was now under the rule of the Xiongnu. Liu Cong died in 318 AD having achieved what no other Xiongnu Chanyu had achieved before him, the actual conquest of China. The Xiongnu Empire in northern China was however highly unstable, mainly because of the bitter internal feuds within the Xiongnu ruling elite. Liu Cong was succeeded by his son Liu Can. Liu Can, however, was almost immediately assassinated by his own father-in-law the general Jin Zhun, who also massacred most members of the imperial clan. Liu Yao, a cousin of the assasinated Xiongnu emperor, recovered the throne for the imperial clan with the support of the Jie warlord Shi Le in the same year. The clan of Jin Zhun and its supporters who had committed the treason were put to the sword. Order was then restored. However, the Xiongnu state began to falter after this internal bloodbath. Liu Yao moved the Xiongnu capital south to Changan and in 319 AD also changed the Chinese name of the state from Han to Zhao, presumably in some way to stress the Xiongnu origins of the dynasty rather than its connections to the Han dynasty of China. However, the recent purges at the Xiongnu court had weakened the control of the Xiongnu central government. Shi Le of the Jie tribe began to carve out a separate Xiongnu-Jie state in the east and soon declared himself the independent ruler of the Later Zhao state. In 329 AD Shi Le and Liu Yao engaged each other in a decisive battle for control of northern China. Liu Yao



was defeated and the Jie tribe of the Shi Clan, probably a former western subject tribe of the Xiongnu confederation (whose physical features were notably more Caucasian in contrast to the presumably Mongoloid core Xiongnu Hun and Chinese inhabitants of the Southern Xiongnu Empire), took charge. Shi Le and his Jie tribe were noticeably different from other Xiongnu both in their outward appearance and also in their approach to governing the conquered Chinese population. The Xiongnu Liu clan understood Chinese ways and sought to preserve the native population relatively intact. Shi Le and the Jie, if we are to believe the hostile records left about them, were notorious for their arbitrary rule, neglect of administrative concerns and most of all cruelty. The name of Shi Le’s distant nephew Shi Hu (who reigned from 334-49 AD) became a byword for barbarian brutality and sadistic behaviour. Reading the records of his reign (if they are even remotely accurate) resembles reading through a grotesque horror novel with the deeds of Vlad Dracula seeming mild in comparison. Such atrocious tyranny could not last indefinitely and a Chinese counter-reaction came in the person of Ran Min, somewhat ironically a native Chinese adopted into the Shi ruling clan. Upon seizing power in 349 AD he organized a genocide against all Hu (barbarians) living in China, especially those of Jie ethnicity. It is alleged that nearly 200,000 barbarians (i.e. non-Chinese) were massacred regardless of sex, age or nationality. In particular people with high noses and full beards were singled out for massacre because those features were regarded to be the indicator of Jie ethnicity. Many native Chinese with those features were also consequently butchered together with the real Jie. In 350 AD Ran Min declared himself the ruler of the new Wei state and ended
the half a century of Xiongnu rule in northern China.35 Shi Zhi the last ruler of the Later Zhao resisted Ran Min until the following year, but Shi Zhi was assassinated by his general Liu Xian in 351 AD. The former lands of the Xiongnu in northern China were then rapidly absorbed by the Xianbei state of Former Yan
headed by the Murong clan and the Di state of Former Qin.36 The Xiongnu who survived the massacres of Ran Min fled north back to their original homeland in Inner Mongolia or submitted to the Xianbei and Di. However, the story of the Huns in China does not end here. Liu Weichen, the leader of the remaining Xiongnu in northern China, became an important vassal of the Di emperor Fu Jian and when the Former Qin Empire of Fu Jian, who had temporarily unified northern China, fell into ruin in the 380s AD Liu Weichen became ruler of a de facto independent Xiongnu kingdom in Inner Mongolia south of the Yellow River. His nascent state, however, was attacked and vanquished by King Tuoba Gui of the Xianbei. Only his son Liu Bobo (381-425 AD) escaped the general massacre of the Xiongnu ruling house carried out by Tuoba Gui. Opportunity for redemption came to Liu Bobo in 407 AD when he was given a military command by the Qiang ruler Yao Xing of Later Qin (a Sino-Tibetan dynasty centred around Changan). When Later Qin made peace with the Tuoba Xianbei who had killed his father, Liu Bobo broke with Later Qin and set up his own state called Xia in the Ningxia region (near Ordos, the traditional homeland of the Huns), declaring himself Tian Wang, the heavenly king. Liu Bobo, who subsequently changed his surname to the more Xiongnu sounding Helian, was noted for being an extremely cruel and vicious ruler who betrayed all the people who had ever done him any favours. However, this



negative representation could in some way be explained by the anti-Helian and anti-Xiongnu propaganda of his arch-enemies the Tuoba Xianbei who eventually came to rule northern China after Helian Bobo’s death. In 415 AD Helian Bobo became allies with the Juqu clan who ruled the state of Northern Liang in Gansu province to the west. The Juqu clan, like Helian Bobo, were Xiongnu in origin and the alliance between the two Xiongnu states in northern China was perhaps only natural. In 417 AD Helian Bobo seized the imperial city of Changan from the Chinese Eastern Jin dynasty, thereby repeating the feat of his ancestors a hundred years earlier in 316 AD. Having captured Changan, Helian Bobo, now master of nearly half of northern China, declared himself emperor. The revived Xiongnu Empire in China would however prove to be as short lived as the Han-Zhao Xiongnu Empire of the preceding fourth century AD. In 431 AD Helian Bobo’s Xiongnu Xia Empire was extinguished by the Tuoba Xianbei. Eight years later in 439 AD the last Xiongnu Hun state in East Asia, the Northern Liang kingdom of the Xiongnu Juqu clan, fell to the Tuoba Xianbei as well. The Xianbei now ruled all of northern China and founded the long-lived Northern Wei Empire. The Juqu clan of the Northern Liang fled west to Gaochang in eastern Xinjiang where they continued Xiongnu rule until 460 AD. This rump Xiongnu statelet was finally annexed by the powerful Rouran Khaganate of Mongolia which was itself created by the fusion of Xiongnu Hun remnants with the Xianbei and perhaps also the Wuhuan. The Southern Xiongnu did not simply disappear as a people after the dissolution of the Xiongnu Empire in the late first century AD, or even after the destruction of the Han-Zhao Xiongnu state in the mid fourth century AD. The Xiongnu as political entities lasted until the middle of the fifth century AD in East Asia, displaying a longevity and tenacity rarely seen in the annals of history. Even after living for nearly 300 years in close proximity with the Chinese, the Xiongnu of the east maintained their distinctive Hunnic identity. As we shall see later in the book, the Huns of Europe likewise did not simply vanish after the death of Attila the Hun. The Xiongnu Huns in traditional Chinese historiography almost uniformly are treated as cruel and arrogant barbarians, whose rule over China was illegitimate and purely destructive. Their representation in Chinese sources is strikingly similar to the equally hostile representation found in our Greco-Roman sources and even some modern historiography on the Huns. Were they simply an aberration, a disastrous calamity that slowed down the progress of civilization in both the east and west? Such a simplistic representation has obvious deficiencies. When the Tuoba Xianbei who had also originated out of the old Xiongnu Empire unified China and established the Northern Wei Empire (386-534 AD), these Inner Asian conquerors of the Chinese introduced into China some of the characteristic features of the old Xiongnu political system. The quasi-feudal tradition of the steppes was applied to a Chinese context and helped create a system in which a ‘barbarian’, military aristocracy ruled over the majority Chinese with the assistance of native bureaucrats. We will see a mirror image of this phenomenon later on in Ostrogothic Italy and Frankish Gaul, which were controlled by political groups also originating out of another Hunnic Empire, that of Attila and the European Huns. Over a period of some 150 years the Inner Asian Northern Wei emperors in the typical steppe manner distributed nearly 850 appanages to the military aristocracy and royal princes. Well over three-quarters



of these fiefs were granted to ethnically Tuoba nobles, thus ensuring the
preservation of elite Xianbei aristocratic ascendency.37 A very similar quasi-feudal system will be observed later on in the book in Europe and also in Central and South Asia where the western cousins of these eastern Inner Asians established their own Inner Asian Empires under the name Hun. The Northern Wei would later split into eastern and western halves and the largely Inner Asian ruling elite of the western half produced the Northern Zhou and Sui dynasties that eventually reunified China. The Li imperial clan of the succeeding Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) was also heavily influenced by Inner Asian precedents and as a matter of fact was related by marriage to the old Inner Asian ruling elite. Inner Asian Turkish cavalry was utilized to unify China after the
collapse of the previous, short-lived Sui dynasty (581-618 AD)38 and many of the powerful aristocrats at the Tang court (including in some cases the emperors themselves) could speak Turkish or were Turks commanding Turkish troops in imperial service. The impact of the Inner Asian Huns and their successors on imperial China was therefore quite profound. An in-depth scholarly research and analysis of this early Inner Asian influence on China remains to be seen.
THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE XIONGNU
A full exposition of the archaeology of the Xiongnu is not within the parameters of this book, but it can be noted that the recent progress in Xiongnu archaeology has veritably revolutionized our understanding of Xiongnu society. Four fully excavated Xiongnu cemeteries (Ivolga, Dyrestui, Burkhan Tolgoi and Daodunzi) and thousands of other recorded tombs in Transbaikalia and Mongolia are gradually reshaping our perception of Xiongnu culture, political organization and economy. For the best collection of the most recent research on Xiongnu archaeology one should consult Brosseder and Miller’s Xiongnu Archaeology:
Multidisciplinary Perspectives of the First Steppe Empire in Inner Asia, 2011a.39
What the archaeological record shows is that the Xiongnu were not the aimlessly ‘wandering nomads’ of lore, but in reality an empire that ‘encompassed
vast territories and varied regions’.40 The dominant element within this empire was steppe pastoralists affiliated with the ruling dynasty and the high aristocracy. However, pastoralism was only one aspect of the Xiongnu economy, which was much more diverse. Agriculture played a significant role and there is archaeological evidence of walled enclosures that have yielded agricultural tools within Xiongnu territory which had previously been thought to be primarily, if not exclusively, pastoralist. In fact, up to 20 fortified settlements have so far been documented in Xiongnu territory. These settlements were permanent sites with
buildings of various types, some of which boast an impressive size.41 The Xiongnu were also extremely active in trade, and grave goods found in Xiongnu cemeteries have yielded both Chinese metal and lacquer vessels and textiles from the southeast and also items originating from the far west from the Greco-Bactrian
areas in Central Asia.42

New research is at the same time breaking the old preconception that the Xiongnu comprised a homogeneous racial or ethnic category. What we are encountering is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, polyglot and multi-tiered society
with a diversified agro-pastoral economy43 and highly stratified political order. The name Xiongnu was clearly a socio-political designation denoting a unified imperial political entity and it cannot be interpreted as the designation of a culturally or genetically homogeneous group. It is a collective label of an imperial entity that encompassed a great variety of ethnic groups and archaeological cultures.

2 THE SO-CALLED ‘TW O-HUNDRED
YEARS INTERLUDE’
In the previous chapter we have seen how the once mighty Xiongnu Hun Empire in Inner Asia split into two halves, the Northern Xiongnu and the Southern Xiongnu. We have also observed how the Southern Xiongnu gravitated south to the Ordos region and eventually became the first non-Chinese ‘barbarian’ people to rule northern China. The political strife between various factions of the Southern Xiongu was also discussed and how in the end the whole of northern China was unified by the Tuoba Xianbei. The Northern Xiongnu for their part were driven out of Mongolia by their erstwhile subjects the Xianbei. Some 100,000 Xiongnu house-holds were incorporated into the new Xianbei confederation, which incidentally simply meant the transfer of political authority from one group of elite to another within pretty much the same political community, rather than the extinction of the Xiongnu as a ‘people’. After all the Xianbei were a constituent part of the Xiongnu state/proto-state. The Xiongnu as explained earlier denoted primarily a political body and its governing elite rather than an ethnic or racial category, although it is clear that the ruling elite of the Xianbei were primarily Mongolic language speakers while the Xiongnu elite seem to have been more akin to Turkic and Yeniseian languages. By the mid second century AD pockets of Xiongnu elite rule existed in the eastern steppes under Xianbei overlordship and tiny Xiongnu statelets were to be found in the Tarim basin. However, the main bulk of the Northern Xiongnu nation was thought to be ‘lost’ somewhere in the west by many historians. Between the mid second century AD and the appearance of the Huns in GrecoRoman historical sources in the mid fourth century AD it was often thought that there is a gap of about two-hundred years during which we know next to nothing about the Huns. It was assumed by many that the Chinese had little to say about the Northern Xiongu during this time and it is therefore impossible to establish a firm connection between these Xiongnu and the later Huns. Fortunately, more recent research on Chinese sources has allowed us to establish a clearer picture of this ‘two-hundred years’ interlude’. Were the Northern Xiongnu extinguished as a political entity? Did they simply vanish during these two-hundred years? Were they completely absorbed by other polities like the Xianbei? The answer is none of the above. The Weilue (=Sanguozhi 30.863-864), a mid third century AD source, which we have already met before, gives us a clear indication that the Xiongnu still existed at the time as a political entity in the Altai region, just west of their original power centre in Mongolia, a hundred years after the mid second century AD which supposedly initiated the two-hundred years’ ‘gap’ in our sources. The Wei



Shu (103.2290), the history of the Tuoba Xianbei state of Northern Wei in China, adds that towards the beginning of the fifth century to the northwest of the Rouran (then the ruling power in Mongolia) there were still in the vicinity of the Altai the remaining descendants of the Xiongnu. The Weilue also provides us with a clear sense of the geographical context in which these Xiongnu Huns were situated in the third century AD. The Weilue notes that the Zhetysu region (modern eastern Kazakhstan) directly to the southwest of the Altai (where the Xiongnu were located) was still occupied by the Wusun people, and the area to the west of this area and north of the Kangju people (centred around the city of Tashkent in what is now modern Uzbekistan) was the territory of the Turkic Dingling tribes. The Wusun and the Kangju are said to have neither expanded nor shrunk since Han times. By the fifth century however, our Chinese sources indicate that this geographical situation had been radically altered. The Wei Shu (102.2268) indicates that a people called the Yueban Xiongnu were now occupying the territory of the Wusun and further makes the observation that these Yueban were a horde of the Chanyu of the Northern Xiongnu. It tells us that when the Northern Xiongnu were defeated by the Han imperial armies they fled westwards. The weak elements among them were left behind in the area north of the city of Qiuci (now in central Xinjiang). Afterwards this weak group of Xiongnu is said to have subjected the land of the Wusun to form the new state of Yueban. The stronger group of Xiongnu/Huns are reported to have headed further west. The Wei Shu
(102, 9b, 5 -6 =Bei Shi 97, 14b, 7-8) shows that the remnants of the defeated Wusun were to be found in the fifth century AD in the Pamirs. Archaeology in addition to the written evidence shows that the main group of Huns/Xiongnu in the Altai region (i.e. the strong Xiongnu as opposed to the weak Xiongnu Yueban) had already started to absorb the Dingling Turkic tribes to their west, an area corresponding to modern northern/northeastern Kazakhstan, and the Irtysh and
Middle Ob regions (western Siberia) in the third century AD.1 This corresponds exactly with the areas from which the Huns of Europe and the Huns of Central Asia would later start their trek to Europe and Sogdia respectively. The Wei Shu (102.2278-9) confirms that the Central Asian White Huns originated from the
Altai region and moved into Central Asia ca. 360 AD,2 at exactly the same time the European Huns were moving into Europe at the expense of the Alans and later the Goths. The defeat suffered by the Xiongnu Huns at the hands of the Xianbei under their inspired leader Tian Shi-huai had not finished off the Northern Xiongnu. Far from it, our sources clearly show that the Xiongnu Huns survived in the Altai region and then later expanded into Central Asia. The Wei Shu specifically states that the fifth century rulers of Sogdia, that is the White Huns, were of Xiongnu origin (102.2270). It also calls the country wen-na-sha, pronounced Huna sha in
Early Middle Chinese, i.e. king of the Huns.3 A fifth century Chinese geographical source called the Shi-san zhou ji by Gan
Yin (preserved in the historical source Sung Shu 98), on the basis of information derived in all probability from Sogdian merchants, notes that the Alans of Europe and the Sogdians (whom the Chinese of the Tuoba Wei court recently learned had



been conquered by the Xiongnu Huns three generations earlier) were under the control of different rulers. As Pulleyblank points out, the need to clarify this implies the common misapprehension among contemporaries that both peoples were ruled by the same ruler, which is quite understandable when we consider the fact that both peoples had been conquered within the space of some ten years by
similar political groups both called Huns.4 Therefore, the literary evidence now strongly supports the political (maybe even ethnic) identification of the European and Central Asian Huns with the Xiongnu of Mongolia. However, while the Huns were languishing in relative obscurity in the Altai region other peoples of Inner Asia were flourishing in the territories that the Huns would later absorb in their trek towards Europe, Persia and India in the fourth century AD. The political and cultural sophistication of these Inner Asian peoples whom the Huns absorbed into their empires further serves to emphasize the complexity and sophistication of the Xiongnu/Hun political model, which facilitated the absorption of such sophisticated political entities. It furthermore contradicts the erroneous picture of a ‘primitive’ Hunnic horde emerging from the ‘backward’ steppes. Inner Asia between the second and fourth centuries AD was far from primitive or backward. In fact the area was arguably the centre of Eurasian civilizational exchange and trade. During the second and third centuries AD Central Asia was dominated by another formidable empire, that of the Kushans whose territory extended from the Tarim basin (to the south of the Altai region where the Xiongnu Huns were situated at this time) to northern India. This formidable empire was founded by the Five Da Yuezhi of Bactria (modern northern Afghanistan), who as we have seen in the previous chapter were originally a steppe people of Tocharian or Iranian extraction driven out of Xinjiang and Gansu by the Xiongnu Empire ca. 162 BC. The Chinese source Han Shu (61 4B) provides us with a brief account of their migration west. After their defeat at the hands of the Xiongnu the Yuezhi
apparently forced their way into the territory of the Sai (Saka)5 in modern eastern Kazakhstan. The displaced Saka then poured into the Greco-Bactrian kingdom founded by Alexander the Great’s successors (Strabo 11.8.4) in modern Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. The Saka were then driven further into Parthia, Sistan (=Sakastan in eastern Iran that is named after them) and even into Pakistan and India by the advancing Yuezhi. The last Yuezhi push against the Saka was the consequence of further Xiongnu Hun activity to the east. The Wusun, as vassals of the Xiongnu, managed to inflict yet another crippling defeat on the Yuezhi and the despondent Yuezhi were forced to move again this time into Bactria at the expense of the Saka. The Yuezhi, when they settled in Bactria, were at first governed by five rulers.
However, among these five ‘Yabghus’6 (kings) the Lord of the Guishuang/Kushan tribe would eventually emerge as the supreme ruler. Under this Kushan dynasty the Yuezhi state came to dominate most of southern Central Asia and parts of South Asia. This is not the place to relate the detailed history of the Kushans, but it is necessary to point out here very briefly the similarities between the Kushan and Xiongnu-Hunnic political practices. Many historians have dismissed the possibility of political sophistication of the Huns due to the belief (erroneous) that, even if the Huns were the Xiongnu, the two-hundred years between the mid second century AD and the fourth century AD would somehow have made it



difficult for the Huns to replicate former Xiongnu imperial political models. Such assumptions are odd to begin with, however, and when we observe the political systems of steppe peoples between the second and fourth centuries AD in Central Asia from which the Huns later emerged, those positions become simply untenable. The above mentioned Kushans possessed political institutions that closely resemble the old Xiongnu and later Hunnic models. Like the Xiongnu the Yuezhi possesed a political and ceremonial centre even when they were ruled by the five yabghus and not yet united under a single dynasty. We can also see the overlapping of military and civilian administration so typical of the Xiongnu system of government in the Kushan system. Kushan inscriptions show that officials called dandanayaka and m ahadandanayaka performed both civil and military functions throughout India. Even more strikingly we learn that among the Kushans collateral succession to the imperial throne and some form of joint rulership and association of sub-kings in the imperial administration were persistently practised right up to the end of
their empire in the third century AD.7 A very similar system of government is also found among the contemporary Sakas (also from Inner Asia) and the Pahlavas (Indo-Parthians) in India. Among the Saka rulers of Mathura in western India a senior king was assisted in his duties by a junior king in a highly developed system of joint rule and this is made clear in the concept of dvairajya (double kingship) among them. Thus, as among the Xiongnu and later steppe empires the Yuezhi/Kushans and even the Saka in India seem to have practised dualism/collective rule and possessed an elaborate hierarchy of sub-kings and officials. Interestingly the Kushans like the Hephthalite and European Huns and also the Alans practised the widespread western steppe custom of artificial cranial deformation which would later be introduced into Europe by the Huns and
Alans.8

The great Kushans were later defeated by the Sassanian Persians in the mid third century AD and Shapur I of Persia (r. 240-70 AD) turned the Kushan



territories into a subsidiary of the wider Persian Empire. The Kushan remnants would survive as the so-called Kushanshahs under Sassanian overlordship until the Hunnic conquest in the fourth century AD. The Yuezhi Kushans, whom the White Huns under the Kidarite dynasty later absorbed (more on this later), were however far from unique. Other steppe polities situated even closer to the Xiongnu Hun power centre in the Altai also possessed matching political sophistication in those ‘two-hundred years’.
FIGURE 2.2 Kushans-Kujula-Kadphises coins

The Kangju state of northern Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan was an equally well-organised state entity that became a power to be reckoned with in the first century A D . Their power was such that they managed to subjugate the warlike Yancai (later the Alans) in western Kazakhstan and keep them in that
state of subservience until at least the second century A D .9 These Kangju were ruled by a yabgu like the Yuezhi Kushans with whom they were dynastically linked by marriage. They also possessed a system of five ‘lesser kings’, indicating that they too had very similar political institutions to their southern and eastern neighbours. Just like the Xiongnu/Huns to the east the Kangju would impose their own ruling elite upon the conquered Alans. Signs of Kangju-Xiongnu contacts can also be seen archaeologically in the discovery of a Xiongnu (Hunnic) style silver belt plaque at Kultobe in Kazakhstan, a site identified as belonging to the
Kangju.10 Many of the sophisticated inhabitants of the Kangju were also actually urban dwellers and only partially pastoralist.
The Wusun, the direct neighbours of the Huns to the southwest in the Ili basin, whose territory the Xiongnu/Huns would later absorb in their expansion west and south in the fourth century AD, also show signs of highly developed political institutions that are reminiscent of the Xiongnu Hun models. Among the Wusun there was a hereditary monarch who was assisted in his duties by a council of elders, a body of aristocrats that could function as a restraint on the powers of the sovereign. There was likewise a fairly complex administrative apparatus consisting of 16 graded officials, who were recruited from the ruling nobility. The officials and nobles of the realm collected taxes/tribute from subordinate tribes



and supplemented their income via war booty and profits from trading activities (much the same as the Hunnic elite later in Europe). The Kunmo, the Wusun Great king and his two sons, the rulers of the left and right domains (in exactly the same way as the Xiongnu), with each wing-ruler commanding a personal force of 10,000 horsemen, ruled over a sophisticated political entity. Both the Kangju and the Wusun were absorbed by the Huns before the Huns advanced on the Alans and Goths in Europe and the Persians and Kushanshahs in eastern Iran and Afghanistan. It is therefore no longer possible to argue that during the ‘two-hundred years interlude’ the Huns lacked political organization, since they were stuck in a politically ‘backward’ region. The observation of the political organization of surrounding peoples who were later conquered by the Huns before their entry into Europe reveals that political organization on a par with the earlier described Xiongnu model in Mongolia and Turkestan existed all throughout the twohundred years in Inner Asia. These states of Inner Asia did not lack political organization and neither did the Huns who emerged from this region. In the first and second centuries AD the Xiongnu Huns were in desperate straits. They were for all intents and purposes surrounded by hostile powers around their core base in the Altai region. To the west and south the Dingling, Kangju and Wusun exerted pressure. To the east the powerful Xianbei and the Han Empire were driving them out completely from their eastern territories. However, respite came to them after the third century AD when each of these menaces disappeared in quick succession. To the east the Han Empire descended into civil war, split into three kingdoms and could no longer exert any influence west. The Xianbei who had earlier inflicted monumental defeats on the Huns during the second century AD were fragmented into feuding tribes. To the west and southwest the Kangju and Kushan Empires were slowly dissolving. It is this favourable geopolitical situation that allowed the Xiongnu to expand into Central Asia and Europe. Archaeological evidence from the Ural region seems to point to the
expansion of the Huns into that area by the early fourth century AD at the latest.11 This suggests that all the states and tribes between the Altai and the Urals had succumbed to Hunnic conquest by the early fourth century. In the next chapter we will discuss the conquest of Central Asia, Persia and India by the Huns.

3 THE HUNS OF CENTRAL ASIA AND
SOUTH ASIA: THE KIDARITE AND
HEPHTHALITE W HITE HUNS
While their cousins who had entered Europe were earning for themselves immortal fame or infamy for their exploits against the Romans and various Germanic peoples, an equally formidable group of Huns left their mark on the history of Central Asia, Iran and India. Their story is not as well known as the story of the European Huns. However, any history of the Huns that leaves out these Central Asian cousins of the European Huns would be incomplete. Only when we view them together can we begin to grasp the full significance of Hunnic expansion across Eurasia. This does not imply of course that the Huns of Central Asia and those of Europe were part of the same political body or had some sort of loose political allegiance to each other. In all likelihood, if such ties existed at the beginning, they rapidly disappeared after the power centres of the Central Asian and European Huns went their separate ways and vast distances began to separate them. The reconstruction of the history of the Huns in Europe has suffered from the fragmentary nature of the sources relating their history (mainly Greco-Roman). The story of the Central Asian Huns is even more difficult to reconstruct because they were for extended periods largely beyond the geopolitical area of interest of both the Greco-Roman historians and Chinese historical sources, while Persian and Indian records provide only limited information. Records about them when they do appear are often contradictory and difficult to interpret. Recent research has allowed us to at least resolve some of the vexing issues surrounding their history, although a full reconstruction of that history still eludes experts.



MAP 3.1 White Hunnic Empire
WHO WERE THE WHITE HUNS?
Much of the research on the Central Asian Huns has been focused on identifying who exactly they were. Debates have raged over their ethnic and racial provenance in particular, much of it fuelled by the contradictory information we find in our Chinese sources about the origin of the rulers of the White Hun Empire. The designation White Hun (Sveta (white) Huna in Indian sources) is found in both our Roman and Indian sources and was most likely the self designation of the overarching political entity chosen by the Huns of Central Asia and there can be no dispute that in this political entity the Huns existed as a political grouping. However, questions have been asked as to whether these White Huns were the same as the Huns who entered Europe and whether the White Huns were governed by Huns or by some other ethnic group. Who were their ancestors and what kind of culture did they possess? These were all perplexing questions and we are now finally able to provide some cautious and limited answers to these vexing questions. As to whether the Central Asian Huns were the same ethnic group as the Huns who entered Europe, the question itself is a self-defeating one, since the Huns were not primarily an ethnic group, but a political category. What seems certain is



that the Central Asian Huns derived from the Xiongnu Empire. Our Chinese sources are unequivocal that the White Hunnic conquerors of Central Asia were originally Xiongnu. As explained earlier, the Wei Shu specifically states that the
fifth century rulers of Sogdia,1 i.e. the White Huns, are Xiongnu in origin (102.2270), thereby confirming the link between Central Asian Huns and the Xiongnu of the Mongolia-Altai region, and calls the country wen-na-sha,
pronounced Huna sha in Early Middle Chinese, i.e. king of the Huns.2 Archaeological evidence may also be mentioned in support of the XiongnuCentral Asian Hun connection. A Hunnic-Xiongnu type cauldron was found near the Amu Darya valley in the Khiva area (northwestern Uzbekistan) and two Hunnic funerary cauldrons made of clay were discovered in the delta of the Syr Darya river, which point to the Xiongnu political and cultural identity of the White Huns. Related artefacts have also been found in the areas controlled by the European Huns as well, which all point to the same tentative conclusion that both
the European and Central Asian Huns were Xiongnu in origin.3 As also noted earlier, the Wei Shu (103.2290) tells us that towards the beginning of the fifth century to the northwest of the Rouran Khaganate (Mongolia) there was still in the vicinity of the Altai the remaining descendants of the old
Xiongnu.4 Wei Shu (102.2278-9) gives more details and relates how the Yeda (i.e. Hephthalites, who are confusingly described as being either of the race of the Yuezhi (Indo-European) or a branch of the Gaoche (Dingling Turks)) ruling clan of the White Huns originated from the Altai mountains (where the Weilue places the Xiongnu in the third century A D ), whence they migrated to the southwest into
Central Asia ca. 3 6 0 A D .5 Therefore, although it is not possible to confirm or deny the common ethnicity of the Central Asian Huns and the European Huns, we can now be reasonably certain that the Central Asian Huns were like the European Huns, a political group that originated out of the old Xiongnu Empire and that they used the same name ‘Hun’ as their state appellation. What is less certain is the identity of the ruling family of this Hunnic Empire in Central Asia. While the Huns were building their empires in Europe and Central Asia in the eastern steppes new confederations began to accumulate power. One of them was called the Rouran, a formidable power group which eventually came to dominate all of Mongolia and who were possibly the so-called Avars of later steppe history. Another less powerful group called the Hua, who according to Chinese sources were originally the vassals of the Rouran, also emerged out of obscurity. This latter group commands our attention because the Chinese source Liangshu (54.812) may provide evidence that would link this steppe confederation (Hua) to the ‘Hephthalite’ clan which in the fifth century AD ruled the White Hun Empire. It has been speculated that the Hephthalites were the ruling dynasty of the Hua, who were originally under Rouran overlordship, but later broke free from the Rouran to assume the leadership of the White Hunnic state in the fifth century
A D .6 Scholars have furthermore asserted that the Chinese glyph for Hua was actually read Var in Early Middle Chinese. Pulleyblank has argued that these Var are in fact identical with the famous Wuhuan of earlier centuries, who were a branch of the Mongolic Donghu confederation (the other branch of which was the



now familair Xianbei). The argument is that Wuhuan in Early Middle Chinese was pronounced something like ‘Agwan’, which due to the absence of the sound r
in Early Middle Chinese was the contemporary rendering of Agwar or Avar.7 This could conceivably make the Hephthalites and the Hua the later Avars who erupted into Europe in the sixth century AD. However La Vaissiere, another notable expert, suggests an alternative reading, which would make Hua the Early Middle Chinese for Ghor, a region of Afghanistan inhabited by the Hephthalites, rather than Var. As of today there is no consensus on the transliteration of Hua. Were the Hephthalites of the fifth century AD new arrivals who hijacked the White Hunnic Empire from its previous Hunnic dynastic rulers or were they simply part of the original Hunnic (Oghuric Turkic) invasion of Central Asia that rose to prominence later within the White Hunnic confederation (La Vaissiere’s argument)? So far there is no clear answer to
this perplexing question. Theophylact Simocatta,8 a late East Roman source from the seventh century AD, provides us with some interesting hints by indicating that the two leading tribes of the Ogur confederation (most probably to be located in modern Kazakhstan) were the Var (possibly Hua-Hephthalites) and Khunni (presumably Huns). Menander (a sixth century AD East Roman source) also refers
to the Varkunites,9 as does Pseudo-Moses of Chorene (an Armenian source) who calls them Walxon (again Var and Hun). This allows us to infer that a mixing of Vars and Huns had taken place some time in the fifth century AD in territory adjacent to the White Hun realm in the north. However, the Var mentioned here may simply be a reference to members of the contemporary Tiele (Chile) Turkic tribal confederacy in the region and may not be linked to the Hua (possibly Var)
tribe associated with the Hephthalites.10
WHITE HUNNIC EXPANSION AND THE KIDARITE DYNASTY
The scholar Czegledy in the mid twentieth century had speculated that the Hua, whom he assumed to be Vars (Avars), may have expanded into Western Turkestan (Central Asia) in the middle of the fourth century AD and that this may have been the trigger that ignited the great Hunnic migration west in the same
century.11 He associated this Hua (Var) activity in Western Turkestan with the rise of the more powerful Rouran (probably in origin the Wuhuan (Avars?) already mentioned above) further to the east. These Rouran, who were originally located in the vicinity of the city of Dunhuang, in close proximity to Turpan (eastern Xinjiang), began their extraordinary rise under Shelun Khagan in the late fourth century. However, there is as yet no firm evidence that would indicate that the Rouran expanded further west before Shelun’s rise in the late fourth century AD, i.e. they appear too late on the scene to have been responsible for putting pressure on the Hua and Huns in the mid fourth century AD. The Hua or the Hephthalites, if our Chinese sources are correct, became the vassals of the Rouran presumably some time in the late fourth century AD or early fifth century AD. The first Rouran movement into what is now modern Kazakhstan (the original territory of the European Huns in the fourth century A D ) should probably be dated to the time of the Tuoba Wei alliance with the Yueban Huns in the fifth century against the Rouran, which is obviously too late to have affected the



original Hunnic expansion into Europe and Central Asia. More recently it has been proposed that the Huns started moving west out of the Altai in the fourth century AD, not because of renewed military pressure from the east (for instance from the Rouran), but because of radical climate deterioration in the Altai region
in that century.12 Neither the military pressure theory nor the climate change explanation are satisfactory, since the Hunnic expansion west of the Altai region may well have commenced long before the fourth century. Erdy, on the basis of archaeological evidence provided by Hunnic cauldrons, has argued for a Hunnic
presence in the Tobol, Irtysh, Middle Ob region already in the third century A D .13 However, the drastic change in climate in the fourth century may have had an impact on the sudden thrust of the Huns remaining in the Altai region in a southwesterly direction into Central Asia. As La Vaissiere shows in his excellent analysis of the Chinese sources on the early migration of the White Huns, the
Huns from the Altai suddenly moved south in the 350s A D .14 The invasion of these Huns rapidly swallowed up what was left of the Kangju state, and put immense pressure on the eastern borders of the Sassanians and Kushan remnants in southern Central Asia. The so-called Kidarite (possibly a term referring to western Huns, deriving from
the old Turkic runic term kidirti meaning west)15 Huns figure prominently in this initial Hunnic intrusion into southern Central Asia and we find them in firm
possession of Bactria ca. 3 6 0 A D .16 An Armenian source, P’awstos Buzandac’i, tells us that the Hon (Huns) under the Kidarite dynasty conquered the region some time before 3 6 7 AD . The question of whether this Kidarite dynasty was ethnically ‘Mongoloid’ Huns (a preconception based on the premise that the Huns were Turkic, and Turks = Mongoloid) or ‘Caucasian’ Iranians has provoked a fruitless discussion among scholars and became, somewhat discouragingly, the dominant focus of research. Tremblay (2001) believed that they and the later Hephthalites, who overthrew them, were both Iranian in origin. Grenet (2002) thought likewise. The whole debate was to a certain degree influenced by the confused account left by the Roman historian Procopius (sixth century A D ) about the name of the Hunnic state in Central Asia: White Huns. Both Procopius and our Indian sources call the Central Asian Huns White Huns or Sveta Huna (White Huns). Procopius (1.3.2-7) noted that the White Huns were ruled by a king and were guided by a lawful constitution, i.e. that they had a sophisticated state structure comparable to those of the Sassanian Persians, with whom they were often in conflict, and also to those of the Romans. But he then misinterpreted the appellation ‘white’ to mean that the White Huns were white and not swarthy like the European Huns supposedly were. As Pulleyblank points out, the colour white was simply symbolic of west among steppe nomads. Black signified north and red the south, hence the existence also of Red Huns (Kermichiones or Alkhon from the Turkic Al-for scarlet+ Hun, meaning Red Huns), who were the southern wing of the White
Huns.17 As Pritsak points out, in steppe societies the colour black signifying north and the colour blue signifying east, both of which carried connotations of
greatness and supremacy,18 almost always had precedence over white (west) and red (south). Thus whichever group constituted the Black or Blue Huns (if they existed, or are identifiable with known Hunnic groups such as Attila’s Huns in Europe or the Yueban Huns in Kazakhstan) probably possessed seniority over the



White Huns, at least initially. The fact that the colour black, kara in Turkish, suggested elevated status among the European Huns also as it did among other Inner Asian Turkic peoples, seems to be confirmed by the report in Olympiodorus (a fifth century AD Roman historian) that the supreme king of the Huns was called
Karaton.19 The Kidarite usage of earlier Kushan symbolism in their coins led some scholars to attribute to them a native Iranian identity. However, it is now becoming increasingly evident that the Kidarites (whose name, as mentioned above, may simply indicate that they are the western Huns) were Hunnic invaders who occupied eastern Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and who gradually became Iranized in culture after their conquest. This has been confirmed recently by the discovery of a seal inscription which calls a certain Lord Ularg as firstly king of
the Huns and then Kushan-shah.20 The Kidarite appropriation of Kushan symbolism and claims to be the heirs to the Kushan legacy should be seen in the light of a long process of acculturation and the White Hunnic Kidarite adaptation
to their new environment. Priscus (fir. 33 and fir. 41),21 a contemporary fifth century Roman source, calls them without any hint of ambiguity or generalization Huns and names the contemporary Kidarite king Khunkas. Tremblay notes that the etymology for this name is most likely to be X(y)on-qan, i.e. Hun Khan (Khan
of the Huns).22 The Chinese source the Bei Shi tells us that a king called Kidara (either a personal name or more likely the attribution of the name of the dynasty to an individual king) conquered the territory north and south of the Hindu Kush (i.e. Afghanistan) some time before 410 AD and had subjected the Gandhara region
(northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan) to Hunnic rule.23 From there the Kidarites became a threat to the Gupta Empire of India (ca. 3 2 0 - 5 5 0 A D ). During the reign of the Indian Gupta king Kumaragupta I ( 4 1 3 - 4 5 5 A D ) the Kidarites pushed into the Punjab (northwestern India). These Kidarites, who were the first major dynasty to rule the White Hun state in Central Asia, were by this stage under increasing pressure from another dynasty, the above mentioned Hephthalites, and were gradually ejected from their northern territories in Sogdia (Uzbekistan) and Bactria (northern Afghanistan) some time in the fifth century AD. They were finally destroyed in the Gandhara region by the Hephthalites towards the end of the fifth century, sometime between 4 7 7 AD (the date of their last embassy to the Tuoba Wei) and 5 2 0 AD (when Gandhara is definitely under Hephthalite control according to a Chinese pilgrim). Before that dramatic ending the Kidarites invaded India repeatedly during the time of the Gupta monarch Skandagupta ( 4 5 5 - 6 7 A D ). The Bhitari pillar inscription dating from the end of the reign of Skandagupta tells of how during the preceding reign of Kumaragupta I, the Hunas (Kidarites) almost destroyed the Gupta state. The hapless Kumaragupta passed over control of the defeated Gupta army to his more competent son Skandagupta. However, even he had troubles coping with the Hunnic invasion. The inscriptions describe how Skandagupta had to reestablish his lineage ‘that had been made to totter’, encounter many dangers
and hardships that forced him even to ‘spend a night sleeping on the bare earth’.24 Skandagupta claims that he vanquished the Hunas and conquered the whole world, but even after this alleged Gupta triumph the Huns remained in control of



much of the Punjab and the Guptas permanently lost control of much of their western territories, leading one to wonder how real and decisive these Gupta claims to victory over the Huns actually were. It was most probably the intrusion of the Hephthalites into Kidarite territory that allowed the Guptas a brief respite from Hunnic invasions, not any decisive Indian military triumph over the Huns. As mentioned earlier, the scholarly research on the Hephthalites who replaced the Kidarites as the ruling clan of the White Hun state was equally preoccupied with the question of the origins of this second Hunnic dynasty. We have already discussed the contentious issue of whether they were new arrivals or part of the initial wave of Hunnic migration into southern Central Asia. Another vexing question for many was again the issue of race. Were the Hephthalites mainly Turco-Mongol (Mongoloid) or Iranian (Caucasoid) in ethnic-racial composition? In the first half of the twentieth century Marquart (1903) and Grousset thought they were Mongols. McGovern also in the early twentieth century and La Vaissiere (2007) argued for a Turkic identity, which is likely to be correct, while Enoki (1959) argued for an Iranian origin. Given the heterogeneous nature of steppe political entities and dynasties, all of the above mentioned ethnicities and ‘racial’ groups were probably represented in some way in the White Hun Hephthalite state. They themselves of course claimed to be Huns and that is how they were also known to their immediate neighbours. The Hunnic origin or self-identification of the Hephthalite dynasty is reflected in the form OIONO or HIONO, which appears
in their coinage.25 The confusion concerning their identity results largely from the multiple and conflicting origin theories provided by our Chinese sources mentioned briefly above. The Wei Shu (102.2278-9), for instance, suggests both an Iranian origin via the Yuezhi and a Turkish alternative via Gaoche. The Iranian origin of the Hephthalites vouched for most prominently by the renowned Japanese Inner Asian scholar Enoki, has now been largely discredited due to the discovery that the so-called Hephthalite language with Iranian affinities, used to justify the Iranian theory, was not introduced by the Hephthalites themselves, but
was the indigenous language of the region conquered by the Hephthalites.26 One could therefore justifiably dismiss the reference to the Yuezhi in the Wei Shu reference above as simply an anachronism common in Chinese historiography. However, the confusion in the Chinese sources is in all likelihood actually indicative of the real ethnic heterogeneity of the Hephthalite state and even its elite. It is likely that the Hephthalite Hunnic state contained a core of largely Turkic speaking military elite, which was rapidly being influenced by Iranian and also Indian cultural practices and languages. At least a partially Mongolic speaking dominant core group might also be a possibility, if we were to accept the Hua=Var=Wuhuan identification suggested by Pulleyblank. Pulleyblank (1983), Golden (1992) and Czegledy (1983) all hint at the possibility that the Mongolic Var (Hua) tribes, along with the presumably Turkic Huns, may have constituted the ruling core of the Hephthalite state and that these Var were connected to the Wuhuan confederacy of Inner Mongolia. As an indication of this, Pulleyblank notes the striking similarities in headdress and hairstyles between the Wuhuan
and the Hephthalites27 (not particularly convincing evidence for determining ethnic origins).



A powerful Iranian cultural influence on the ruling elite also cannot be ruled out. Known Hephthalite personal names certainly give this impression. They seem to be for the most part Iranian (though alternative Turkic etymologies are also sometimes offered by experts), indicating a high degree of cultural and probably ethnic fusion between Turco-Mongol Huns and native Iranians. The same heterogeneity was of course, as already highlighted, a characteristic feature of the earlier Xiongnu and also the European Huns whom we will discuss shortly. In any case, one of the last Hephthalite rulers to be recorded in history, a certain Nizak (or Tirek) who ruled in the region of Badghis (in western Afghanistan), bore the title Tarkhan, which incidentally was originally a Xiongnu title. The fact that the Hephthalites referred to themselves as Huns argues definitively against an Iranian, sedentary origin in Badakhstan (northern Afghanistan). However, the Iranization of the Hephthalites and the presence of an Iranian element in their confederacy from very early on are certainly possible. The Persians would call both the Kidarite Huns and Hephthalite Huns collectively as Chionites. Despite objections by some, most historians now agree
that the Chionites and the Huns were one and the same.28 The arrival of these Chionites (the Kidarites) had serious consequences for the history of Iran. In 3 5 0 AD the Sassanian king Shapur II had to abandon his siege of the Roman fortress of Nisibis in order to deal with the new threat emerging on his empire’s eastern borders. The war against these new enemies lasted for eight long years ( 3 5 0 - 3 5 8 A D ) and Shapur somehow managed to end hostilities by forging an uneasy alliance with the Huns. The benefit of this alliance was the provision of Hunnic military aid to the Persians. Shapur used his newly won Hunnic allies to augment his army in the siege of Amida in 3 6 0 AD . During the siege Grumbates, the king (probably a sub-king) of the Chionites (his name being possibly Kurum-pat:
Turkish, ruling prince), lost his son.29 The unfortunate Romans within the city then had to bear the brunt of the rage of the infuriated Hunnic king. By the subsequent reign of Bahram IV the Sassanians, having suffered repeated defeats, had lost almost all of their eastern Iranian lands (which Sassanian Persia had seized earlier from the Kushans) to the White Huns under the Kidarites. Only the strategic oasis city of Merv (in modern Turkmenistan) remained of Persia’s
eastern possessions.30 To make matters worse Persia was forced to pay a regular tribute to the Huns. The Sassanian king Yazdegard II (reigned 438-57) ca. 442 AD halted the humiliating tribute payments and attempted to reverse the defeats the Sassanians had suffered at the hands of the Kidarite Huns. By 450 AD the Persians seem to have managed to push their way into either Tokharistan/Bactria (namely the city/region of Taliqan in northeastern Afghanistan near the city of Balkh) or more probably an adjacent region further to the west. The sudden success enjoyed by the Persians over the Huns in the 440s and 450s (after nearly a century of constant one-sided battering at the hands of the Huns) requires explanation and one explanatory factor is very easy to identify. It has already been noted above that the Kidarite invasions of India intensified during this very period and that this was due mainly to Hephthalite pressure which was building against the Kidarites. The Kidarites at this time found themselves trapped in a pincer attack by the Hephthalites and the Sassanians, hence the increased urgency to find an escape route into India during these decades. This pattern of Inner Asian peoples invading India to escape conquest by a more powerful Inner



Asian group would be repeated throughout the later history of India, the most famous example being the famous Timurid Mughal conquest of India. The Mughals of the sixteenth century AD were pushed south by the more powerful Shaybanid Uzbeks from the north. Around 456 AD or slightly earlier around 454 AD the Persian king Yazdegard was feeling confident enough to demand reverse tribute from the Kidarite Huns. The Huns refused to comply and in a major engagement that followed the Persians suffered another decisive defeat, which reversed all previous Persian gains in the preceding decade. To make matters worse a bitter civil war erupted shortly afterwards within the beleaguered Persian Empire. The next Sassanian king Peroz (reigned 457-84) overcame his brother Hormizd and seized the Persian throne with the support of an army provided by the Hephthalite Huns. In order to repay the Hephtalites for their assistance, Peroz may have ceded the formerly Kidarite possession of Taliqan (wherever the city was located, see above) to the Hephthalites. The Kidarites, sensing Persian weakness, renewed their offensive against the Persians and in 464 AD the desperate Peroz even resorted to asking the Eastern Romans for financial aid against the Kidarites, a request which was haughtily refused by Constantinople. In order to buy time and to appease the Kidarites Peroz offered the Kidarite ruler Khunkhas his sister in marriage. According to Priscus, Peroz resorted to subterfuge and sent a woman of lowly status rather than his sister as wife to Khunkhas. The Hunnic king soon discovered the deception and sought revenge. He invited 300 Persian officers to his realm and then murdered or mutilated them in order to humiliate Peroz. War was renewed and the balance was tipped in favour of the Persians when once again the Hephthalites intervened on the side of the Persians. The allies captured the Kidarite capital of Balaam (possibly Balkh?) in 467 AD and the Kidarties retreated to Gandhara where their rule was later extinguished by the Hephthalites.
WHITE HUNNIC EMPIRE AT ITS ZENITH UNDER THE HEPHTHALITE DYNASTY
The cooperation between the Hephthalites and the Persians against a common enemy, the Kidarites, would not survive the demise of the Kidarites. The Hephthalites seized the Kidarite territory that the Persians had taken and assumed leadership of all the White Huns. Peroz attempted to take back those lands, but he was resoundingly defeated by a Hephthalite king called Akhshunwar (or
Khushnavaz).31 Peroz was captured by the Huns on two occasions and managed to escape death by agreeing to pay a huge ransom-tribute and sending one of his sons to the Hephthalite court as a hostage. Persia had now again been reduced to the status of a vassal state to the Huns. Peroz, however, had still not learnt his lesson and tried his luck against the Huns once again. According to Procopius (1.3.1-22; 1.4.1-14) he was slain with most of his army in a disastrous battle with the Hephthalites in 484 AD. The historian Agathias (4.27.3-4, a sixth century AD
East Roman source)32 provides much the same information as Procopius and emphasizes again that the Hephthalites were a Hunnic people. These triumphs over the Sassanians made the name of the Hephthalite Huns a terror to the Persians and other Iranian peoples.



The victorious Hephthalites then proceeded to intervene in Sassanian internal affairs. In 488 AD Kavad, one of Peroz’s surviving sons, elicited support from his White Hunnic Hephthalite overlords. The Huns married Kavad to either the daughter or sister of the reigning Hunnic king and then provided him with the
necessary military aid to gain the Sassanian throne.33 Kavad was forced to seek refuge with the Hephthalites yet again ten years later due to a revolt. The Hephthalites supplied him with 30,000 men to reclaim his kingdom. However, the price for this aid was high. Kavad was forced to cede more territory to the Huns and pay an increased annual tribute. Part of the Sassanian coinage was countermarked with a Hephthalite sign signaling that they were destined as
tribute to the Hunnic king34 and the Hephthalite kings claimed that they were the legitimate rulers of Iran, the Sassanians being merely their vassals. The Persian king Kavad, increasingly short of funds, asked the East Romans, with whom Persia had relatively good relations for about half a century (which was largely due to Hunnic pressure which prevented the Persians from upsetting the Romans, and vice versa, the Romans the Persians due to the European Hunnic threat, rather than any new amicable intentions on the part of the two powers), for loans. The Romans, just as they had refused the request from his father Peroz before him, arrogantly rebuffed Kavad. In 502 AD Kavad renewed the ancient hostilities
between the two empires in order to avenge his humiliation.35 The Persians would continue to pay tribute to the Huns from 484 AD to the 550s AD during the reign of Khusrau I (531-79 AD). With the Persians subjected the Hephthalite Hunnic Empire now reached the zenith of its power. The Hephthalites proceeded to expand east as well. In the last decade of the fifth century AD Kashgar and Khotan were occupied and between 497 AD and 509 AD Karashahr and the region of modern day Urumchi (all regions in Xinjiang in western China) fell to the Hephthalite Huns. Nearly all of Eastern and Western Turkestan were now in Hephthalite hands. The Chinese historical records mention the vast extent of the Hephthalite White Hunnic Empire. The Liangshu 54 lists among their
domains Persia, Kashmir, Karashahr, Kucha, Kashgar and Khotan and the Bei Shi
97 names Kangju (Sogdia), Khotan, Kashgar and Persia.36 More than thirty lands to the west of China are seen as being subject to the White Huns in our sources. After also conquering the Kidarites in Gandhara and northwestern India in the late fifth century AD, the Hephthalites began their invasions of India during the reign of King Budhagupta of the declining Gupta Empire of India in the last quarter of the fifth century. In the early sixth century AD a Hephthalite sub-king by the name of Toramana, who was called by the Indians ‘the boundlessly famed ruler of the earth’, conquered all of western India penetrating as far east as modern day Madhya Pradesh and completely dominating Uttar Pradesh, Rajputana, Punjab, and Kashmir. His son Mihirakula became the ruler of virtually the whole of northern India. His capital in India seems to have been Sakala (modern Sialkot in Pakistan). His cruelty however is said to have incited the vassalized Indians to rebel against him. He somehow ended up in the custody of a certain Baladitya (possibly a Gupta ruler or magnate). In the meantime the brother of Mihirakula usurped the Hunnic throne. By the second quarter of the sixth century AD the Hephthalite Hunnic Empire was probably the most extensive empire in the world. In the east it extended as far



as Urumchi in modern day Xinjiang, in the south central India, in the north the steppes of Kazakhstan and in the west up to the borders of the Eastern Roman Empire via its vassals the Sassanian Persians. However, the glory of the Central Asian Huns would be numbered in the middle of the sixth century AD when a new power emerged in the east, the Göktürks. The Hephthalites had been linked in some way to the powerful Rouran Khaganate in Mongolia in the early stages of their rise. Chinese sources suggest that they were initially the vassals of the Rouran before becoming independent. By the middle of the sixth century AD the Rouran Khaganate was overthrown by the Göktürk Khaganate and the new rulers of the eastern steppes, the Turks, now sought to conquer the Hephthalites as well. The Sassanian Persians who had been seeking an opportunity to cast off the Hunnic yoke tried to form an alliance with the Göktürks against their Hephthalite overlords. The Turkish Khagan reacted swiftly and a mighty Göktürk army seized the city of Tashkent and then engaged the Hephthalite army under King Gatfar near Bukhara. A titanic struggle ensued, a gigantic eight-day battle involving contingents drawn from nearly every Inner Asian nationality. The result was the complete defeat of the Hephthalite Huns. The Turks duly occupied Transoxiana from the retreating Hephthalites who elected a new king called Faganish (also called Afganish) as they fled south. The Hephthalites were now, however, trapped between the Persians and the Turks and the last Hephthalite king surrended to King Khusrau of Persia sometime between 5 6 0 and 5 6 3 AD.
LATER HUNNIC STATES IN CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTH ASIA
Yet, this was not the end of the history of the Huns in Central Asia and India. Their history from this point onwards, though equally fascinating, however, becomes even more difficult to reconstruct due to the increasing sparcity of primary source material and the great divergence in opinion among scholars who have visited this topic. Only tentative assumptions can at this stage be made about these final centuries of Hunnic presence in Central Asia and India. It is hoped that further research on this particularly understudied subject of history will lead to a better understanding of the later ‘Hephthalites’ and ‘Hunas’ who appear sporadically in our sources. After the collapse of the Hephthalite White Hunnic Empire, disputes immediately arose between the Turks and Sassanians over control of former Hephthalite lands and peoples. During this Turk-Sassanian rivalry White Hunnic or partially White Hunnic polities emerged out of the ruin of the Hephthalite Empire in areas which now correspond to modern Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the early decades of the seventh century AD Sassanian Persian power in the east went into terminal decline and all former Hephthalite territories in Afghanistan as well as lands to the north of the Oxus (Amu Darya) river (which had been occupied by the Göktürks earlier in the preceding sixth century A D ) fell under Western Turkish overlordship (the Göktürk Khaganate by this stage having split into two separate Eastern and Western Turkish Empires). The Turks in some cases imposed new rulers on the White Huns, but in parts of Afghanistan minor Hephthalite dynasties may have continued to rule under Western Turkish overlordship. Due to the mixing of newly arrived Göktürks with the original Huns (both peoples being Inner Asian in origin) during this period of Western Turkish over



lordship, it becomes increasingly difficult from the early seventh century AD onwards to distinguish which state/dynasty is Hunnic and which is Western Turkish in origin. In former Hephthalite territory what was happening was probably the common Inner Asian phenomenon of new ruling dynasties being superimposed on an older, established, military elite, in this case still largely Hephthalite White Hunnic. So just as the Kidarite dynasty had been displaced earlier by the Hephthalite dynasty in the previous fifth century AD, now in the late sixth and early seventh centuries AD Western Turkic ruling families progressively displaced former Hephthalite rulers, but continued to reign over pretty much the same agglomeration of Hunnic peoples with no doubt certain, important, new injections of Inner Asian tribes added to the mix. Just as the White Huns claimed the heritage of earlier Kushans and utilized Kushan titles and symbolism to legitimize their rule, these new Western Turk dynasts also at times seem to have claimed White Hunnic Hephthalite heritage and utilized Hunnic titles and traditions to gain the support of the largely Hunnic elites of the regions they came to control. The Western Turkish Khaganate, which dominated Central Asia, soon fell into chaos due to internal strife and the pressure exerted on it from the east by the formidable Tang dynasty of China in the middle of the seventh century AD. At the same time the western territories of the Turks in southern Central Asia were exposed to new Arab Muslim invasions. Around 7 1 9 AD a possibly Hephthalite king by the name of Tish the ‘One-eyed’, taking advantage of the Arab invasion of Central Asia which had weakened the authority of the Turk yabghu (ruler) of Tokharistan (corresponding to roughly northern Afghanistan), established control over most of Tokharistan and declared himself king of much of northern Afganistan and parts of Tajikistan with the title of Yabghu. These presumably Hephthalite kings (or Western Turkish rulers claiming the heritage of the Hephthalites and ruling over former Hephthalite Huns) would continue to rule in this region until the middle of the eighth century AD . In 7 2 9 AD a king whose name seems to have been Qutlugh Ton Tardu sent an embassy to the Tang court in Changan to solicit aid against the Arabs. In 7 5 8 AD the last ‘Hephthalite’ king of Tokharistan whose name is known to history, a certain Wu-na-to, arrived at the
Chinese capital.37 His realm seems to have been swallowed up by the Arabs by this time. The Hephthalite Hunnic struggle against the Muslims also took place further west. The Arabs had defeated the surviving Hephthalites in the Herat region of western Afghanistan in the second half of the seventh century AD. However, a Hephthalite (or Hunnified Western Turkish) ruler with the title Tarkhan named Nizak (or Tirek according to some scholars) led the Huns and other groups against the new conquerors in the early eighth century AD in the Herat and Badhghis regions. After this resistance had been crushed by the Arabs and the presumably Hunnic kings of Tokharistan also vanquished, Muslim supremacy in northern and western Afghanistan became uncontested. Curiously, however, the famous medieval Khalaj tribe of Afghanistan is thought by some scholars to be the remnants of these vanquished Hephthalite Huns. Others argue that these tribesmen were not Huns in origin, but Turks settled in the region by the Western Turks in the seventh century AD or earlier. Yet, as pointed out earlier, the introduction of new Turkish tribal elements and



ruling clans often went hand-in-hand with the merging of these new elements with the more numerous local White Huns. It is thought that some of these ‘Turks’, who doubtlessly included strong Hunnic elements, later merged with the
local Pashtuns to form the dominant Ghilzai Pashtuns of Afghanistan,38 a group that is renowned to this day for their ferocious warrior tradition and their spirited resistance against successive waves of invaders including the Safavid Persians in the eighteenth century, the British in the nineteenth, the Soviets in the twentieth and finally the Americans in the twenty-first century. Elements of these Pashtunized Huns/Turks were also the later founders of the Khilji/Ghilji dynasty that ruled the Delhi Sultanate of India in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries AD. In India and Pakistan too the Hephthalite Hunnic legacy lived on long after the destruction of the Hephthalite Empire in Central Asia. In Gandhara and Kashmir a White Hunnic ruler called Pravarasena seems to have succeeded to the inheritance of the Hun king Mihirakula and ruled in the middle of the sixth century AD, building a city named after himself (Pravarasenapura, modern Srinagar) and the great temple of Pravaresha. He is said to have been succeeded by King Gokarna, a follower of the god Shiva, and then by a ruler called Narendraditya Khinkhila who may have exercised control over a large area stretching from Kashmir to Kabul in the late sixth century AD. Khinkhila was then apparently succeeded by King Yudhishthira, who seems to have been the last independent Hephthalite Hunnic ruler of northwestern India. According to the differing interpretations of the available evidence, he (or perhaps his predecessor) was either forced to submit to the Western Turks around 625 AD and then eliminated before 630 AD or alternatively continued to rule in some capacity until the middle of the seventh century AD. Remnants of the same Hephthalite ruling family may have remained in power, albeit in dependent positions, in parts of Kashmir and other areas after the final demise of the main imperial dynasty. Meanwhile some time later in the seventh century AD in Kabul-Kapisa and Gandhara a new dynasty, possibly of White Hunnic origin (or perhaps a Western Turkic dynasty, claiming the legacy of the Hephthalites), called the ‘Turk’ Shahis
took over and continued to reign until the mid ninth century AD.39 Because of the dearth of evidence available and due to the persistent instability in Afghanistan that continues to hinder further valuable archaeological research, it is difficult to say at present what the exact origins of the Shahi were. What we do know is that this at least partially Hunnic Shahi kingdom of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan also struggled against the Arabs. The Arabs after conquering Sistan in the 650s AD started to make inroads into Shahi territory. Kabul soon fell to their onslaught. However, the Shahi counter-attacked and almost immediately drove the Muslims out of not only Kabul, but also Zabulistan (the area around Ghazni) and ancient Arachosia (Kandahar). The Arab general Yazid b. Ziyad was killed in battle while trying to win back Zabulistan and the Arab invasion of Kabul in 697-8 AD was decisively repulsed. The subsequent kings of Zabul, who may have been relatives of the Shahi rulers of Kabul and Gandhara and who, like the Shahi, seem to have used Hephthalite titles, would continue to defy the Arabs thereafter. The Shahi kingdom from 719 AD was ruled by a certain Tegin Shah. Around 739 AD Tegin abdicated the throne in favour of his son Fromo Kesaro, who some



speculate may have been named in honour of the Roman Caesar. The Caesar in question may have been the ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire, Leo III the Isaurian, whose embassy is thought to have passed through Central Asia in 719 AD. The Eastern Romans, while passing through, possibly conveyed news about their great victory over the Arabs in 717 AD. The Shahi may have appreciated this Roman success against their common Muslim enemy and named their crown prince ‘Caesar’. This Fromo Kesaro (reigned ca. 739-46 AD) would win a great victory over the Arabs and claim to have imposed ‘taxes’ (probably some form of payment) on the Muslims. It is speculated by scholars that the story of Kesaro’s heroic career and victories over the Arabs may have contributed to the forging of the famous Tibetan legend of King Phrom Ge-sar, whose exploits were celebrated in a massive epic poem. The Shahi kingdom of eastern Afghanistan would however eventually fall to the Muslim onslaught in the late ninth century AD. Kabul, Zabul and Kandahar were all lost to the Muslims, while Gandhara came under the rule of a possibly new dynasty that would be called Hindu Shahi, rather than Turk Shahi. The later Hephthalites and their descendants were gradually Indianized and Pashtunized, so that by the time of the Shahi these formerly Turkic Huns of Afghanistan and Pakistan were able to present themselves to their subjects as de facto native rulers of the regions they controlled. Their role in the preservation of India’s Hindu culture and civilization will be discussed later on.
POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND CULTURE OF THE WHITE HUNS
Little is known about the political organization of these Central Asian Huns. However, from the scant information we do possess we can note the fact that the political practices of these Huns were remarkably similar to those of the European Huns. The White Hun state possessed an administrative apparatus at both central and local levels. It was in essence a typical Inner Asian tributary empire ruling over many local dependent states and fiefs. In Hephthalite inscriptions we encounter titles such as oazorko, fromalaro, hazaroxto and asbarobido (the last
indicating the military commander of cavalry).40 As among the European Huns and the Xiongnu, the succession to the Hephthalite White Hunnic throne could pass from uncle to nephew, rather than from father to son (which mirrors the succession of Bleda and Attila among the European Huns to the throne after their
uncles Ruga and Octar).41 The White Huns also practised artificial cranial deformation which was practised among the elite of the European Huns and
Alans.42 They furthermore possessed the familiar Xiongnu Hun system of appointing vassal kings (a practice also found among the European Huns), e.g. the king of Zabulistan who ruled an almost autonomous fief within the empire and was instrumental in spearheading the Hephthalite conquest of northwestern India. As in the old Xiongnu Empire collective governance of the state was practised by several high ranking aristocrats (with new titles such as yabghus (borrowed
probably from either the Kangju or Kushans) and tegins).43 In India the Kidarites and then the Hephthalite Huns also introduced the rule of multiple rajas and rajputs who held territories in ‘fie f to their common overlord the Hunnic supreme king or emperor. Thus a form of quasi-feudalism was introduced to India and a



transformation in the administration of revenues took place.44 The Kidarites are known to have created conditions favourable to international trade and they maintained the monetary and economic system of the regions they conquered without disturbing them. In fact Hunnic rule of Central Asia marked the beginning of the golden age of Sogdian cities such as Samarkand, Bukhara,
Paykend and Panjikent,45 which in many ways exposes the hollowness of the legend of Hunnic ‘destructiveness’. In Khwarezm (northwestern Uzbekistan) at sites such as Barak-tam Hunnic rulers erected two-storey castles with ceremonial halls and carpets in a style that is, according to the great Inner Asian archaeologist Tolstov who excavated the site, distinct and different from previous local structures. The symbiosis and also dichotomy between the dominant ruling steppe pastoralist, i.e. the Huns who constituted much of the imperial army and highranking nobility, and the conquered sedentary local population seems to have persisted throughout the Hunnic period (both Kidarite and Hephthalite). However, the upper elite of the White Huns seems to have adapted to local conditions and traditions fairly quickly, readily absorbing elements of Kushan-Indian, Sassanian Persian and Sogdian cultures, especially in their art and architecture. Many Hephthalites, as Litvinsky has shown, were also only semi-nomadic/pastoralists as evidenced by archaeological sites such as the town of Kafyr-qala (southern Tajikistan) in which large quantiies of Hephthalite coins, sealings and even inscriptions have been discovered, clearly indicative of an extended Hephthalite presence. The famous giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan, which tragically were destroyed by the infamous Taliban, were probably built under White Hunnic rule and these Buddhas together with other marvellous artefacts discovered in the same area are a testament to White Hunnic religious pluralism, cultural sophistication and cosmopolitanism. The coinage of the White Huns shows an astonishing multi-lingualism employing legends inscribed in Sogdian, Middle Persian, Bactrian and Brahmi. The Hephthalites are also known to have used Bactrian, Pahlavi, Kharosthi and Brahmi. Like the Hunnic-Germanic kings of Europe who we will encounter later in the book, these Huns of Central Asia were keen to present themselves as legitimate heirs to the preceding rulers of the regions they conquered. In the case of the Kidarites in particular, as mentioned briefly above, the legacy of the Kushans seems to have been treated with particular care and attention, so much so that these Hunnic kings claimed to be the heirs to the Kushan kings. The rhetoric of the restoration of the Kushan state may have been a very clever propaganda tool employed by the Kidarite Huns to gain the loyalty of their new subjects. Just a century prior to the Hunnic arrival the Kushans had been overwhelmed by the Persian Sassanians. The propaganda suited the new Hunnic conquerors well and gave them a certain legitimacy in the eyes of the local population.
HUNNIC IMPACT ON IRAN AND INDIA
The conquest of the White Huns had a lasting impact on the histories of both Iran and India. The Sassanian Persians suffered not only military humiliation and vassalage at the hands of the Huns, but also as a direct consequence of their
defeats suffered a crisis of legitimacy.46 Before the Hunnic period the Sassanians had legitimated their overthrow of the preceding Parthian Arsacid dynasty and



their usurpation of royal power by appealing to their record of military success against the Romans. Victory over the traditional aggressor (Rome), which had repeatedly sacked the Iranian capital of Ctesiphon in the second and third centuries AD and against whom the Arsacids had been increasingly impotent, was held up as the legitimizing standard of the new Sassanian dynasty. However, the embarrassing defeats suffered by the Sassanians at the hands of the Huns and the reality of the self-proclaimed ruler of both Iran and non-Iran, the Sassanian king, having to play second fiddle and pay tribute to his Hunnic overlord seriously shook the very foundations of Sassanian legitimacy based on the notion of being
the victorious defender of a superior Iran against foreign enemies.47 The Sassanians had to come up with a new ideology to buttress their legitimacy in the eyes of the Iranian aristocracy and people. What appeared was the ‘national’ history (or rather propagandistic pseudo-history) of Iran constructed around the mythical deeds of the legendary forebears of the Sassanians, the Kayanian kings. This legendary history was recast and reshaped to address pressing contemporary concerns. The Sassanians manipulated the traditional religion of Iran, Zoroastrianism, to reinvent themselves as the legitimate
descendants of the legendary Kayanian kings,48 whom they argued were universal kings from whom even the Romans were ultimately derived. The eventual triumph of the Kayanians, after many hardships, in these legends over their arch enemies the Turanians (now equated with the Turkic peoples threatening Iran to the east, i.e. the Kidarite and Hephthalite Huns) helped alleviate somewhat the humiliating reality of Sassanian vassalage to the Huns and excuse the devastating defeats of the king of kings at the hands of the Huns. The reasoning being that the great holy Kayanians had to undergo a similar ordeal. What mattered was ‘legitimacy’. The fictitious Kayanid lineage of the Sassanians served the purpose of instilling within the Persian population, especially the Parthian nobles who were artificially inserted into the fictitious Kayanid descent system, a sense of reverence for the dynasty and more importantly of promoting absolute obedience to the Sassanian ruler. The tradition of the Kayanian kings was useful in promoting the ideology of a well-ordered, autocractic state. The tradition at every turn emphasized loyalty to the ruler and stressed the need to maintain a strict distinction between social classes, since discrimination was considered a necessary condition for a stable and orderly society. It was argued that class confusion and the elimination of class differentiation would undermine the social order. Discrimination was given the official stamp of approval by being attributed to great antiquity to add credibility to an otherwise specious argument. Political dissenters like the Mazdakites were rejected as heretics and ruthlessly persecuted, since their doctrine seems to have advocated the blurring of the distinction between classes of men. The patriotic ‘universalism’ and ‘quasi-nationalism’ of the Zoroastrian Kayanid lineage system, which was in effect recreated due to the historic circumstance of Hunnic domination, helped shape the future political order of Sassanian Iran and contributed mightily to the creation of medieval ‘Iranian’ identity. Within the universalizing rhetoric of the Sassanians there was no place for the ethnic specificity of the Parthians for instance. In the pseudo-history that the Sassanians articulated the Parthians and other regional/ethnic rulers became ‘historical’ ‘Persians’ who owed loyalty and obedience to the Kayanid house. They all became



Iranians. The eventual destruction of the Hunnic Hephthalite Empire at the hands of the Göktürks in the mid sixth century AD, in which the Sassanians opportunistically participated, vindicated the dynastic myth of Kayanian legitimacy and triumph in the face of adversity. This new myth would help sustain Iranian identity in later history when Iran again found itself under the yoke of another foreign enemy, the Muslim Arabs. Ironically the experience of the Hunnic yoke facilitated the strengthening of an Iranian identity that would defy assimilation to later conquerors and invaders who would dominate Iran. In India, as mentioned briefly above, the Kidarite and Hephthalite invasions led to the creation of a new political order. The enigmatic, possibly Hunnic states of western India and Afghanistan like the Turk Shahi realm of Kabul and Gandhara also effectively blocked the invasions of the Arab Muslims into India from the northwest. Although it is not certain, it also seems likely that the formidable Gurjara Pratihara regime (ruled from the seventh-eleventh centuries AD) of northern India, had a powerful White Hunnic element. The Gurjara Pratiharas who were likely created from a fusion of White Hunnic and native Indian elements ruled a vast empire in northern India and they also halted Arab Muslim expansion into India via Sind for centuries, thereby safeguarding India’s Hindu religion and cultural traditions from Islamization. The Muslims would eventually break through under the Turkic Ghaznavids when both the Shahis and the Gurjaras began to decline in the tenth century AD. However, by then the militant process of conversions of most of the Near East and the Iranian world, a characteristic feature of the early Caliphate (Rashidun and Umayyad), was a thing of the past and India’s religious and cultural universe, despite the imposition of Muslim overlords, was able to persist and survive the conquest. The Huns of India and their descendants may have contributed to the preservation of India’s Hindu civilization and culture from Islamization. Some of the Hunas (Huns) in India also seem to have been instrumental in the formation of the famous Rajputs, a people who would be renowned throughout Indian history for their warlike traditions and feats of valour.

4 THE HUNS OF EUROPE
PRE-HUNNIC HUNS?
The Huns of Europe first appear on the horizons of our Greco-Roman sources in the 370s AD when they famously defeated first the Alans and then the Greutungi and Tervingi Goths in what is now Ukraine and Romania. However, on the basis of etymological conjectures it has been speculated (most notably by MaenchenHelfen (1973)) that Turkic groups related to the Huns were already active west of the Volga river in Europe much earlier since the second century AD. The speculation was fuelled by the identification of a group called the Khunnoi by Ptolemy (3.5.10), a Greco-Roman geographer in the second century AD, in the vicinity of the Germanic Bastarnae and Sarmatian Roxolani in the Pontic steppes. Were these Khunnoi in some way related to the Huns? The name is certainly strikingly similar and given the fact that Xiongnu (Hunnic) groups are known to have been active in Kazakhstan long before the second century AD, the presence of some splinter groups of Huns or Turkic groups calling themselves Huns in Europe is not beyond the realm of possibility. However, until we possess more definitive evidence, whether archaeological or linguistic, it is not possible to definitively pronounce positively or negatively about this hypothesis. As we have shown in earlier chapters, the main body of Huns during the second and third centuries AD were situated much further east in the Altai region between Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Between them and the Alans of southern Russia there were the Turkic Dingling tribes. The absorption of these Dingling into the Hunnic state was a long drawn out process, as was probably also the conquest of the Alans in the fourth century AD. Therefore, at present it is not possible to take it for granted that some Turkic groups (maybe related to the Huns) were present in Europe before the arrival of the main Huns in Alan territory.



MAP 4.1 Hun Empire in Europe
EUROPE ON THE EVE OF HUNNIC ARRIVAL
Before the arrival of the Huns the long peninsula stretching out of continental Eurasia, that is Europe, was dominated by three main groups. The first were the various Sarmatian groups including the Alans whom we have discussed in an earlier chapter. With the exception of the powerful Alans centred around what is now the Kuban steppe region in southern Russia, the Sarmatians in the fourth century AD were a politically fragmented and increasingly marginalized group scattered across Eastern and Central Europe. The old Sarmatian heartland of modern Ukraine and Romania was largely in the hands of the predominantly Germanic speaking (though heavily Sarmatianized) Goths. The Goths and other Germanic groups dominated much of Central Europe and parts of Eastern Europe from where they posed a military threat to both the Sarmatians in the east and the Roman Empire to the south and west. The Germanic tribes of the fourth century AD before the arrival of the Huns had developed a socio-political system that somewhat mimicked practices found in the steppe zone to the east, but apparently at a more rudimentary stage of evolution. In the major Germanic tribal confederacies there were what appears to be ‘over-kings’ of some sort and other loose forms of hegemony, e.g. among the Tervingi Goths (in modern Romania) and the Alamanni (southwestern Germany). What is noteworthy is the fact that such loose hegemonies, although they did



feature to a certain extent a stronger aristocratic component which allowed for a
tighter control of military retinues,1 was essentially the same type of tribal organization with highly unstable kingship which had existed earlier among the
Germanic peoples in the previous first and second centuries A D .2 There is no evidence to show that the Tervingi Gothic, Frankish and Alamannic confederations of the fourth century differed in any significant way in their organization and political structure from the same confederations in the previous third century AD. Greater interaction with the Romans may have rendered these Germanic confederacies more socially complex. However, politically and militarily the Germanic tribes of the fourth century were no stronger or more formidable than their forebears in the third century who had menaced Rome’s northern and western frontiers. What is interesting is the fact that there does seem to be indications that Germanic tribal groups in the east (mainly the two branches of Goths) had become much stronger and better organized than those in the western parts (e.g. the Franks and the Alemanni) by the second half of the fourth century AD . Even more striking is the gap in organizational sophistication between the eastern and western branch of the Goths themselves. The Goths of the west, the Tervingi, like other Germanic tribes further to the west, were ruled by numerous, largely independent, tribal chiefs (the so-called reguli), who only occasionally (usually out of military necessity) obeyed the authority of an overlord called iudex. We learn from the Roman church historian Socrates that there were frequent internal disputes and civil wars among the Tervingi tribes, e.g. between those led by a leader called Athanaric and those following a warlord called
Fritigern.3 Later the Tervingi in the last decades of the fourth and early fifth centuries AD gradually evolved into the more tightly organized and politically centralized Visigoths. However, this evolution occurred only after their extensive encounters with the eastern Alans and the Huns and after they had adopted mounted warfare and other military-political practices of the steppe region (from
the Huns, Alans and possibly also the Greuthungi Goths).4 Unlike their more haphazardly organized western cousins, the Greuthungi Goths who inhabited the Pontic steppe (modern Ukraine) possessed the most advanced and centralized political organization of all the Germanic peoples with an increasing trend within their polity towards associating kingship with a
specific dynasty.5 This can be clearly seen in the election of Videricus, a grandson of King Ermanaric, as king despite him being a minor (according to the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, our principal source for the history of the fourth century AD, 31.3.3). Such tighter organization was due largely to the Greuthungi Goths’ early contacts with the Scythian-Sarmatian political culture of the steppe
region and their virtual symbiosis with the Sarmatians.6 Inter-marriages between the Goths and the Sarmatians, especially among the elite, were widespread and intense acculturation took place between the Goths and Alans/Sarmatians. Prominent Gothic and Alanic figures in the fourth and fifth centuries AD, some of whom we will meet later on in the book, were most often of mixed Alan-Goth heritage. For instance, Aspar, the great Alan general in the service of the Eastern Romans, had a Gothic mother and an Alan father. The East Gothic cavalry commanders who engineered the Visigothic triumph at Adrianople over the



Romans, Alatheus and Saphrax, both appear to possess Alanic names, as do the two Gothic kings Odotheus (386 AD) and Radagaisus (405-6 AD, the name Radagaisus is similar to the Sarmatian name Rathagosos, mentioned in an inscription at Olbia) who later try to break out of Hunnic domination with a group of Goths into Roman territory. The Greuthungi Goths and even some of the other East Germanic tribes such as the Vandals and Gepids were in fact so thoroughly Sarmatianized that Procopius in the sixth century AD would argue that they were in fact separate from the Germanic peoples and were originally
Sarmatians and Getae.7 Many East Gothic ruling clans were also likely of Alan or Sarmatian mixed origin. For instance, the famous clan name Amal (the name of the ruling clan of the East Goths after the break-up of the Hunnic Empire and maybe also before the Hunnic invasion) is likely of Iranian origin, Avestic am a: powerful, strong, which
is also curiously enough the name of a Mithra deity.8 The likelihood of this etymology is confirmed by the information given by the Gothic historian Jordanes (sixth century AD) that the mythical ancestors of the Amal dynasty among whom
the figure of Amal, the eponymous ancestor, stands out, were demi-gods.9 Further indications of an Alanic/Sarmatian element in the Amal clan can also be found in other parts of Jordanes’ history, which tells us that Andag, an Amal of the mid
fifth century AD, was married to the sister of Candac, the Alan king.10 The name Andag, a scion of the Amali, itself is almost certainly a Sarmatian name as the appearance of the Sarmatian name Andaakos in a third century AD Tanais
inscription shows.11 The later Ostrogoths (the East Goths of the fifth and sixth centuries AD), who doubtlessly included the Greuthungi, certainly show all the features typical of steppe peoples: mounted warfare, royal hunts, falconry, shamanism and the wearing of Iranian-Central Asian royal vestments by the powerful royal dynasty
of the Amals.12 This level of familiarity with Central Asian steppe culture and traditions among the Goths was the natural consequence of nearly a hundred years of Hunnic domination of the Goths in the earlier fourth and fifth centuries AD, and the culture of the later Ostrogoths cannot be seen as representing the culture of the Greuthungi before the Hunnic conquest. However, there can be no doubt that the East Goths more than any other Germanic people were heavily exposed to Inner Asian culture and influence even before the Hunnic conquest. In sharp contrast to the political sophistication of the almost Central Asian steppe kingdom of the Greuthungi Goths, centralization of the kind needed for an organized state structure simply did not exist in other parts of Germania before the arrival of the Huns. Only in times of war did these Germanic tribal confederations of the fourth century show organization that approaches the type of control found among steppe empires. However, even then what is shown is not a cohesive military force with a clear command structure, but rather a loose gathering of numerous reguli (petty kings) or rather war chiefs who were primus inter pares rather than sovereign rulers. For instance when Chonodomarius, the strongest of the Alamannic chiefs, gathers an army of Alamanni before the battle of Argentoratum in 357 AD, he is given neither magisterial nor official power over
the army that has gathered to combat the Romans.13 He is shown to be simply the



strongest among numerous completely independent chiefs who are categorized by Ammianus, our Roman source, as great or small on the basis of the size of the retinue accompanying the ‘king’. Thus Chonodomarius is said to be the equal of his nephew who is accompanying him into battle. Five other ‘kings’ also possess power that approaches his power, and ten more petty kings (regales) who are
deemed weaker participate. There are also a host of ‘nobles’ (optimatum) and troops who are fighting not because of state or royal authority that compels them to fight, but partly for pay (mercede) and partly because of an agreement (pacto) to
fight for the kings.14 The control of these Alamannic ‘kings’ over their people was so weak that before the battle the ‘royals’ are bullied into dismounting from their horses by the outraged rank and file for being presumptuous and thinking themselves to be
superior to the rest.15 Followers also force the kings to act in accordance with their wishes as in the case of a certain Vadomarius, who is compelled to join Chonodomarius by his retinue. Another feckless ‘king’ by the name of
Gundomadus is actually killed for dissenting with the majority view.16 This is certainly not the picture of an organized state entity or even a rudimentary proto state. As in earlier centuries these so-called Germanic kings of the fourth century were in essence merely the representatives of their respective kin-based clans. Thus kings were called cynings among the western Germanic tribes, i.e. ‘the man
who represents the cyn (kin)’.17 A similar situation seems to have existed among the slightly more centralized Tervingi Goths in Romania as well. Among them there were also numerous reiks who ruled more or less independently over limited
territory with associated peoples called the kuni. Athanaric the judge (iudex) of the Tervingi had only superficial control over the various tribes supposedly under his authority and could not prevent lesser leaders from acting independently or
even making their own agreements with the Romans without his authorization.18 It is only after the Alamanni went through a period of Hunnic domination in the first half of the fifth century that we find evidence for stable kingship being practised among them. The Franks of the fourth century AD (a confederacy to the north of the Alamanni) were equally as decentralized as the Alamanni. Their confederacy was made up of multiple independent groups such as the Chamavi, Chattuarii, Bructeri and Amsivari. These autonomous groups were controlled by a host of
petty kings (reguli) and duces19 often in dispute with one another. Thus Arbogast
the Frankish war leader is found feuding with the reguli Marcomer and Sumno.20 Only among the Germanic tribes that had thoroughly mixed with steppe peoples or were in close proximity to them do we find a more cohesive organization in areas west of the Greuthungi. For instance, Ammianus (17.12.21) tell us that among the Quadi in Central Europe near the Carpathian basin, there was an over king, a subregulus, optimates et iudices. This somewhat resembles the type of organization one would expect to find in a steppe confederacy or kingdom and arguably this is no accident, since the Quadi were in close proximity to the Sarmatian Iazyges with whom they interacted on a regular basis. What is not possible to figure out from this brief account in Ammianus is



whether this represents the existence among the Quadi of a clear ranking system of the steppe sort or this is just a reference to various tribal leaders commanding groups of warriors of different sizes. The latter might actually be closer to the picture Ammianus has in mind. It could be that the subregulus (sub-petty king) Agilmundus is called such, not because of his rank in a political system of the steppe Central Asian sort, but simply because he is a leader with a smaller retinue than the big regalis Vitrodorus. Presumably the optimates and iudices are leaders with even smaller retinues. A development towards a more unified and hierarchical political structure among the East Germans under Sarmatian influence in the mid fourth century AD is nevertheless clearly a possibility. Whether the situation among the Quadi (assuming that it does represent some kind of a ranking system) was a permanent state of affairs or merely a reflection of a temporary union such as that found among the Alamanni and Franks to the west in times of crisis or war remains unclear. The weakness of central authority and loose political integration limited the military effectiveness of these otherwise formidable and martial Germanic tribes (even the Goths) who also in most cases lacked the proper siege weapons to
successfully besiege Roman fortified towns.21 They thus posed only a marginal threat to the maintenance of Roman political authority. As we shall see later the Hunnic ability to besiege towns in protracted siege warfare would radically alter
this situation.22 The Germanic cavalry, of particular importance to Gothic and Vandal armies of the late fourth and fifth centuries, would also develop into a competent fighting force only after the Germanic contacts with and imitation of the tactics of Central Asian invaders, the Huns and Alans. It was of course this steppe style cavalry (Alan and Greuthungi) that brought the Goths their great
victory over the Romans at Adrianople.23 The third and by far the most important power in Europe in mid fourth century AD was of course the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was without a doubt the superpower of the age and had dominated Western Eurasia and North Africa for hundreds of years prior to the arrival of the Huns. It had weathered a severe military, political and socio-economic crisis in the preceding third century AD. What eventually emerged out of the mayhem of the third century, which saw Persian and Germanic invaders ravage most of the border provinces of the Empire, was a much more bureaucratic state, a better organized military establishment and two separate, though related, Roman Empires in the east and west. The myth propagated by generations of historians about the ‘decline’ of the Roman Empire, especially in terms of military power since the second century AD (most famously by Gibbon), has now largely been proved false in the light of overwhelming evidence from the fourth and fifth centuries AD , which shows the vitality of the Roman state, particularly its eastern half. Recent scholarship on the Late Roman Empire has rightly emphasized the strength of the Roman state and its armies vis-a-vis their immediate neighbours the Germanic tribes, who despite their significant military prowess, due to their inability to develop more centralized forms of poltical control, could still not in
the fourth century AD seriously pose a mortal threat to the Romans.24 The Roman Empire of the fourth century AD was as impressive and as imposing as it had ever been in its earlier history. In terms of administrative organization, bureaucracy



and management of military resources, the Empire of the fourth century AD was more sophisticated and arguably more efficient than it had been before. Peter Heather argues for a minimum of an increase by a third of Roman military manpower in the late third to mid fourth century AD, from ca. 300,000 men to
anywhere between 400,000 to 600,000 men.25 This estimate is corroborated by ancient sources. John Lydus (De Mensibus 1.27) gives a total of 389,704 men in the
army under Diocletian and 45,562 in the navy. Agathias (Hist. 13.7-8) gives the probably exaggerated number of 645,000. These numbers could well be slightly exaggerated. However, there seems to be no doubt that the army had increased in size. Scholars therefore now argue that the fourth century AD may well have marked the highpoint of Roman imperial
rule.26 As Matthews points out, the imperial government of mid fourth century AD was unmatched in all of Greco-Roman history ‘in its scale and complexity of
organization’.27 Kelly notes also that there was a noticeable transition from ‘soft’ to ‘hard’ government which brought about an unparalleled centralization of the
imperial government which was both more effective and intrusive.28 The expansion of bureaucracy and administrative reorganization obviously meant more taxes, and some modern historians have speculated (on the basis of modern political ideology rather than strict observation of contemporary conditions) that the outwardly impressive administrative reorganizations were actually the root causes of internal decay, population decline and even military collapse. However, the opposite was in fact the case. The fourth and fifth centuries AD actually saw the population of the empire increasing (especially in the east) and the rural economy was flourishing at the same time, particularly in the eastern half of the
Roman Empire.29 There is no reason whatsoever to associate more effective control over resources with ‘decline’ and ‘decay’. The centralization of imperial authority and greater government intrusion actually, far from bringing about military ‘decline’, was instrumental in the revival of Roman military strength. Under Diocletian and his successors in the early fourth century AD the number of legions in the Roman army compared to the third century armies under the Severan emperors increased exponentially from 33 to over 67. In the eastern provinces alone there were 28 legions, 70 cavalry
units, 54 auxiliary alae and 54 cohorts.30 The number of infantry in the legions was reduced and the cavalry wing of the imperial armies, critical to coping with Rome’s more mobile enemies in the fourth century, was significantly augmented. This allowed the empire to build up highly mobile field armies that were for the first time commanded by experienced, professional soldiers, a truly significant improvement from the days of the early empire when commanders of regiments and generals of armies had been for the most part actually civilians holding temporary commissions and who were in reality amateurs who rarely had enough military experience. A significant portion of the empire’s best troops was progressively becoming
Germanic or Alan in origin.31 However, there is nothing in the history of the fourth and fifth centuries AD that could lead us to believe that these naturalized ‘barbarians’ were anything but very loyal Roman soldiers. If anything, history attests that they were often the most effective and devoted of the imperial troops.



Rome in the fourth century AD was still by far the most formidable military power in Western Eurasia. Rome’s only real comparable opponent was the Sassanian Persian Empire to the east who by the fourth century had largely been contained. The geopolitical reality until the 370s AD favoured Rome. Before the appearance of the Huns all evidence from the fourth century, both historical and archaeological, points to the likelihood of a lasting continuation of Roman imperial rule even with the occasional barbarian disturbance on the empire’s fringes.
THE INVASION OF THE HUNS
The geopolitical situation mentioned above had actually been the recurrent state of affairs in Europe and Western Eurasia as a whole since the first century AD . For nearly 400 years little had changed to this geopolitical landscape other than the occasional forays of one group into the sphere controlled by another. The arrival of the Huns would change all this dramatically. The Huns as recounted earlier first overwhelmed the powerful Alans. Some of the Alans were absorbed into the growing Hunnic Empire in Europe. Others fled west to avoid living under Hunnic rule. The account given by our principal source for this early phase of Hunnic expansion in Europe, Amminanus Marcellinus, is so hopelessly confused and distorted that the exact sequence of events that followed the Hunnic conquest of the Alans is difficult to reconstruct. Ammianus seems to suggest that the Huns, after conquering the Alans, then immediately fell upon the Greuthungi Goths under King Ermanaric in the Ukraine. He tells us that this led to the death of the aforementioned Gothic king. But then right after this Ammianus notes that the subsequent Gothic king Vithimeris with the assistance
of some other Huns (hunis aliis) fought off the Alans invading his lands.32 Does this imply that the Huns were so disorganized at this early stage that some of them even offered their services to the Goths whom they had just defeated? Maenchen-Helfen speculated that these ‘other Huns’ of Ammianus were not the Huns who had just before defeated the Greuthungi Goths but the Chunni (mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century A D ) who he conjectures may have included some Turkic tribes such as the Alpidzuri, Alcidzuri, etc., who were already living west of the Volga at the time of the Hunnic invasion and had joined
the Goths in resisting the new invaders.33 This is an interesting theory and we can note for instance that some of these presumably ‘Turkic’ groups Maenchen-Helfen identifies such as the Alpidzuri etc. continued to resist Hunnic domination even after retreating to the Danube well after 3 7 6 A D . However, it could also be that Ammianus has simply muddled up the sequence of events which unfolded. It would make much better sense if we assumed that the people who fell upon the Greuthungi Goths of Ermanaric after the Alan defeat at the hands of the Huns were not the Huns who were further to the east, but elements of the Alans who were fleeing west away from the Hunnic troops pursuing them. It is likely that the Goths under pressure from these Alan refugees appealed for aid from the Huns who arrived in pursuit of their defeated Alan enemies. After the Alans were dealt with to their satisfaction the Huns probably then in Machiavellian fashion fell upon the weakened Greuthungi Goths and conquered them as well. The rapidity of the Hunnic conquest of the wellorganized Greuthungi can best be explained if we reinterpret Ammianus’ account



in this way. The relentless Hunnic expansion continued. After the Greuthungi had fallen, next it was the turn of the Tervingi Goths. The more disorganized Tervingi were easily defeated by the Huns and with their homeland in Romania occupied by Hunnic invaders, the Tervingi and other Gothic and Alanic groups flooded across the Danube into Roman territory. The Roman mishandling of this refugee crisis led to the revolt of the Tervingi Goths. A showdown followed at the famous battle of Adrianople where the Roman emperor Valens and most of the field army of the Eastern Roman Empire were cut to pieces by the ferocious cavalry charge of the combined Greuthungi-Alan cavalry who had arrived on the battlefield to relieve the hard-pressed Tervingi. The speculation that there were also Huns participating in this battle seems unlikely. What the battle did show was the glaring tactical inferiority of the Roman army vis-a-vis the steppe-type army fielded by the Greuthungi-Alans under their presumably Alan or Greuthungi leaders Alatheus and Saphrax. The age of the invincibility of Roman infantry armies was now clearly a thing of the past and the Romans discovered to their horror that their military system, despite the reforms of Constantine and subsequent emperors, was still out of date in comparison with the novel type of warfare being introduced from the steppe region. The terror of the Hunnic name preceded them into Roman territory, relayed by the tales told by Gothic and Alanic refugees who flooded Rome’s Balkan provinces. We hear references being made to the so-called Thracian Huns who served as mercenaries in the army of the Roman emperor Theodosius the Great under their own chiefs. However, in all likelihood these so-called Huns were probably the non-Hunnic Turkic groups such as the Alpidzuri who once in Roman territory masqueraded as Huns in order to take advantage of the military prestige that emanated from that name. There were also even runaway slaves and deserters from the Roman army who called themselves Huns to exploit the terror inspired by the Huns. This group of vagabonds ravaged Thrace in 401 AD until

territories across the Danube.36 The fact that the Huns in possibly their first ever recorded raid into Roman territory had to resort to using recently conquered nonHunnic subject peoples gives us a clear indication of the dearth of Hunnic troops in this extreme western edge of their empire in the early 380s A D .

rem em b ered b y th e R om an s. In th e sam e y e a r in 4 0 8 AD U ldin in p erson led an ill



fated adventure into Roman territory.44 The invasion ended in failure, partially due to treachery among Uldin’s own retainers and captains who were incited to rebellion by Roman bribes. The Romans after their less than sporting victory sold the captured Scirians and other Germanic prisoners of war from Uldin’s army into slavery, which incidentally confirms the fact that most of the ‘Hunnic’ army in the west at this stage still consisted of unreliable Germanic, Alanic, etc. levies. Nonetheless the extraordinary counter-measures taken by the Romans after Uldin’s invasion to prevent future Hunnic invasions, fortifications and the strengthening of the Roman fleet along the Danube, demonstrated that this Hunnic setback had still given the Romans a scare. Hunnic retribution for this defeat would eventually come with terrible consequences for the Romans. After this debacle we hear no more about Uldin and in the next decade our sources become even more patchier and fragmentary making it nearly impossible to figure out the contours of Hunnic history for these two decades before the kings Ruga and Octar emerge on the scene. We learn from Olympiodorus, an early fifth century source, that in the second decade of the fifth century (ca. 412 A D ) the Huns were ruled by a supreme king called Karaton. Olympiodorus, who is a rarely available eye-witness of events within the Hunnic Empire, travelled on an embassy to the Huns in order to negotiate with a Hunnic sub-king called Donatus. He records that Donatus was in unknown circumstances murdered, presumably by Roman agents. His overlord Karaton the ‘6 tcov pqycov jrpcoroq’ (the first of the
kings),45 was enraged by this, but for some unknown reason was somehow appeased with lavish gifts from the Romans. Incidentally this account in Olympiodorus is one of the clearest indications that the Huns in Europe practised the hierarchical division of power between the supreme ruler (as among the earlier Xiongnu and the Central Asian Huns) and subordinate vassal kings.
RUGA AND OCTAR
By the 420s AD the kingship of the Hunnic Empire rested in the hands of two brothers, Ruga (sometimes also referred to as Rua or by the Gothified name Rugila) the supreme king who ruled in the east and Octar, his brother, who seems to have acted as his deputy in the west. There were two more brothers: Mundzuk who was the father of Bleda and Attila, and a certain Oebarsius (who was held in great honour and later sat on the same couch as the Hunnic king Attila in royal banquets). Given the fact that Mundzuk’s sons, the two nephews of Ruga and Octar, succeeded their uncles and Mundzuk himself does not feature as a king in his own right in Roman sources, it can be conjectured that Mundzuk was the eldest of the four brothers who had died before the death of the previous supreme king of the Huns (presumably the father or uncle of the four brothers). In the steppes, the eldest living male of the imperial clan usually had the strongest claim to the imperial throne regardless of whether the deceased ruler had a son or not. Thus Bleda and Attila, although they were nephews and not the sons of the two previous rulers, Ruga and Octar, nonetheless succeeded to the imperial throne of the Huns, most probably by the principle of seniority and also the withdrawal of their uncle Oebarsius (presuambly the youngest of the four brothers) from candidacy. The Hunnic kings Ruga and Octar seem to have had a close relationship with



the Roman strongman Aetius, who had spent his early years as a hostage at the Hunnic court. Aetius was able to enjoy the continued favour and military support of the Huns for his own ambition within the Roman Empire. In 4 2 5 AD he supposedly employed an army of 60,000 (!) Huns to support his candidate for Western Roman emperor, the usurper John, against the forces of Emperor Theodosius II. The situation was all resolved before the Huns could be deployed. However, this alliance between Aetius and the Huns would endure into the next decade with Ruga providing military assistance to his ally Aetius, whenever the latter requested it. During the reign of Ruga and Octar Hunnic expansion continued unabated. In 4 3 0 AD Octar was campaigning with a force of 1 0 ,0 0 0 men in the far west of the Hunnic realm just east of the Rhine when he came across a group of fugitive Burgundians ca. 3 ,0 0 0 in number, according to the church historian Socrates. The account given next by Socrates, which many experts have regarded as simply a fable and downright unhistorical, tells of how Octar, who was extremely gluttonous, ‘burst open’ during the night and died an ignoble death. This threw the Huns into confusion and the Burgundians are said to have used this chaos within the Hunnic camp to thoroughly rout the Huns. Because Socrates attributes this Burgundian triumph to the intervention of the Christian God who had been gratified by the conversion of the Burgundians in the face of the Hunnic peril, scholars have tended to reject the historicity of this account. However, there are grounds for taking this story a bit more seriously. The Burgundians after this event became particularly formidable and a grave threat to the security of Roman Gaul. The sudden augmentation of Burgundian power may to a certain extent be explained by their unexpected victory over the Huns, which resulted in the death of one of the principal kings of the Huns. This would have given the Burgundians immense prestige among the Germanic tribes in the west and may have persuaded many to join the Burgundian confederacy. That the Burgundians had inflicted some form of embarrassment on the Huns can also be guessed from the particularly severe penalties imposed on the defeated
Burgundians by the Huns later in 437 AD. Prosper,46 a fifth century Roman chronicler, tells us that the Huns in alliance with Aetius destroyed the Burgundians in that year. Reportedly 20,000 Burgundians were massacred by the Huns and King Gundahar of the Burgundians shared the fate of his people. Attila, who was by this stage probably the king of the western half of the Hunnic Empire as the deputy of his eastern overlord, Bleda the supreme king, seems to have played a prominent role in the destruction of the Burgundians. He is the principal character responsible for the extinction of the Burgundians in the later Germanic epic of the Nibelungen, where he is remembered as Etzel. In contrast to the good relations between the Huns and Aetius, whom Ruga may have regarded essentially as his vassal, Hunnic relations with the Eastern Roman Empire were fraught with difficulties. Thus, in 4 2 2 AD the Huns under Ruga forced the eastern Emperor Theodosius II to negotiate peace and promise an annual tribute of 350 pounds of gold. The Eastern Romans had suffered a reverse against the Sassanian Persians that year as well. Interestingly after this debacle the Roman emperor put up an inscription (the Hebdomon inscription) claiming that
h e w a s v icto rio u s e v e ry w h e r e .47 A m ilita ry d e fe at w a s th u s p o rtra y e d b y th e R om ans as a trium ph, a w arn in g sign th at w e can not accep t as fact every assertion



of victory in our Roman sources. In 434 AD Ruga dispatched his envoy, Esla, to Constantinople demanding the return of fugitive peoples from the Hunnic realm who had been granted asylum within the Eastern Roman Empire, the Amilzuri, Itimari, Tunsures, Boisci and others. What is interesting is that the names of some of these tribes have clear Turkic etymologies, suggesting therefore, as discussed earlier, that there were possibly other Turkic groups in Europe before the Hunnic arrival, who were still at this late stage resisting Hunnic domination. As mentioned earlier, in the 420s Ruga had already invaded Thrace and had forced the Romans to pay a light annual tribute to the Huns. Now the stakes were raised higher and Ruga led his immense army into Thrace yet again, leaving the Romans in a state of panic. The situation was aggravated by the fact that a significant portion of the Eastern Roman army was away in the west battling the Vandals in North Africa. The forces that Constantinople was able to muster for the defence of the imperial capital were easily brushed aside by Ruga’s army. Then, according to our sources (Socrates, Theodoret and John of Nikiu) God destroyed Ruga and his followers in accordance with the prophecies found in the book of Ezekiel (38:2, 22). Ruga, as the blessed archbishop Proclus the Patriarch (434-47 A D ) had preached to his terrified congregation, had been struck dead by God’s lightning for his hubris. The truth may have been more prosaic than this fantastic tale, but Ruga had indeed in circumstances that escape us died before he could launch his decisive attack on Constantinople. The city celebrated and the emperor Theodosius II celebrated a triumph over the ‘vanquished’ Huns, despite the fact that the Roman army had been summarily defeated and no victories had been won by Roman arms. The Huns left without a king departed and returned home. This was interpreted as a ‘victory’ by the Romans. It would not be the first or the last.

political organ ization as it w as fu n ction in g during the reigns o f A ttila and B leda.

explained th at such form idable m ilitary pow er w as due to the tactical and



Strategie superiority of Inner Asian mobile armies and advanced military practices. Inner Asians were no primitive hordes of barbarians. In terms of military sophistication they were superior even to the Romans. However, this military superiority had a prerequisite: political unity among steppe peoples. When united under strong political control an army made up of Inner Asian cavalrymen was virtually invincible due to the superior military skills (the world’s best horsemanship and archery with the ‘wonder’ weapon of the steppes, the composite reflex bow, which had over twice the range of the later famous English longbow) of its soldiers and superior battle tactics employed by its generals. With this formidable military machine the Huns according to Priscus controlled a vast territory which in the east stretched to an area very close to the land of the
Medes (i.e. the Persians in Iran).50 He records a Hunnic invasion, probably in the
420s51 into Media (Iran), launched under the command of Basich and Kursich, members of the royal fam ily (tcov ßocaiAdcov XkuGcov) and commanders o f a large
force {noKkov jrArjGouq ocpxovrocq). That the Huns controlled territory at least as far east as the Volga region is confirmed by archaeology through the discovery of Hunnic cauldrons along the Kama river and Attila’s gift of furs to visiting ambassadors. This is probably an indication that the Hunnic tributary system reached deep into even the forest region of western Russia beyond the Pontic steppe. The presence of Hunnic princely graves, made identifiable by distinctive Hunnic artefacts such as the golden bow (an insignia of rank among the Huns), dating to the early fifth century AD across a vast area stretching from the Rhine to areas east of the Dnieper provide archaeological evidence for Hunnic imperial rule over most of Central and Eastern Europe. Attila, according to Priscus’ source, a man from the Western Roman Empire called Constantiolus, whom Priscus met during the embassy (another eye-witness source), ruled over the whole of Scythia and even the islands of the ocean (presumably a reference to parts of Scandinavia, which was at the time thought to
be an island).52 Attila was according to Priscus contemplating the conquest of
Persia, during the time of his embassy.53 When the Romans with Priscus prayed that God would incite Attila and his Huns to attack the Persians and not the Romans, Constantiolus warns them that if the Huns succeed in conquering Persia, Attila will no longer tolerate Roman ‘independence’ and ‘holding them to be
obviously his servants’ would force the Romans to call him an emperor.54 In fact Attila was so contemptuous of Roman power that Priscus notes he regarded the
Roman emperors as equals to his generals.55 The account of Priscus tells us several critical things about Hunnic political organization in the middle of the fifth century AD and earlier. The commissioning of two high-ranking members of the royal family to important military commands is clearly reminiscent of earlier Xiongnu practices, which assigned major military forces to royal relatives. Priscus also mentions that the Hun noble Edeco was one
of the intimates of Attila (epitedeios),56 who guarded the person of the king in shifts. We see here a mirror image of the common Inner Asian practice of royal bodyguards. Similar royal bodyguards performing the same functions as Edeco were to be found also in the contemporary Rouran Khaganate in Mongolia to the east. We furthermore hear of Attila’s logades (picked men) who feature repeatedly



in our sources on the Huns. These logades commanded military units (probably organized along tribal lines) in the Hunnic army and their ranks included eminent men such as Edeco the ruler of the Sciri, Berik ‘the ruler of many villages in
Scythia’ due to his noble birth,57 and men with more lowly origins like Orestes, the father of the last Western Roman emperor Romulus Augustulus (who was probably of Greco-Roman origin of some sort). The ‘picked men’ also clearly performed civil administrative functions as well as a military role, thereby echoing the overlapping of civilian and military roles of Inner Asian government officials/dignitaries which we have observed earlier in
the book.58 Priscus did not clearly identify distinctions between the various logades (identifying which was of course not the purpose of his embassy and he should be given credit for even noticing the intricacies of Hunnic political organization), but he does leave us with tantalizing clues. He tells us that there was a distinct and regulated hierarchy among the logades themselves. This is shown by the characteristically Inner Asian seating arrangements during the feasts organized by Attila for the Roman ambassadors. Onegesius and Berik, both logades, were seated to the right and left of the Hunnic king, but Onegesius outranking Berik sat to the right of the king which was considered more honourable. This detail, often overlooked, is highly significant since in the old Xiongnu Hun Empire and also all other steppe societies, the right (signifying the east, with orientation towards the north) had precedence over the left (west). By way of example the Muslim geographer Ibn Fadlan (9 2 2 A D ) tells us that the Khazars and the Volga Bulgars (partially descendants of the Huns) also held the right (east) as the place of honour. Thus the most important princes of the realm were seated to the right of the ruler/Khagan. Interestingly in the seating arrangement at Attila’s court banquet senior members of the Hunnic royal family, who ranked even higher than the logades, such as the king’s paternal uncle Oebarsius and the eldest son of the king were seated in conspicuous positions of honour as befits their rank right next to the
king on the same couch.59 That the logades were not randomly selected men, but are actually identical with the ranked officials of a traditional steppe empire such as the Xiongnu, is confirmed by the later Byzantine use of the same term to
describe graded officials within the Avar Empire that succeeded the Huns.60 Because Priscus does not give us clear indications of which tier of governors and officials the various logades belonged to, we cannot be entirely sure as to which level of the old Xiongnu hierarchy these Hunnic Lords were equivalent to. What is clear is that they were directly answerable to the central government of the Hunnic Empire and at least some of them were in all likelihood the equivalent of major provincial governors such as the Xiongnu 24 lords of ‘ten thousand horsemen’, who administered the main provinces (in the steppes and also in the Hunnic realm often groups of tribes situated in a fixed region, rather than a strictly defined territorial block) and regulated the relations between the centre and the peripheral vassal sub-kingdoms. This identification is made highly likely by the fact that Edeco and other logades often functioned as royal ambassadors and communiques to large vassal tribes. Onegesius, who was by far the most important of the logades, was sent to the Akatziri tribe in the Ukraine to supervise



the instalment of Ellac, the Hunnic crown prince, as direct overlord of the tribe.61 We see very similar duties performed by major Xiongnu governors and sub
kings.62 Revealingly the name or rather the title of one of Attila’s kinsmen Emmedzur is according to Altheim the Latinized corruption of a formal Hunnic
title ämäcur which means ‘horse lord’.63 This almost exactly matches the title given to major governors of the Xiongnu Empire, Lord of ten thousand horsemen. These logades of course did not suddenly turn up under Attila. The so-called
oikeioi (retainers) and lochagoi (captains) of Uldin (the western Hunnic king of the early fifth century) who betrayed Uldin during his campaign against the Romans were probably lower ranks of the logades decribed at the time of Attila. These captains/governors during military campaigns not only commanded specific squadrons of Huns assigned to each of them, but also contingents drawn from
subject peoples provided by the districts/provinces that they governed.64 Taxes and tribute were also collected from subject peoples either by the logades or more probably by lower-ranking officials working under their administration, usually it seems in kind (agricultural produce of various kinds). As in the contemporary Roman Empire, taxes in the Hunnic Empire were apparently collected in rather ruthless fashion. Chelchal the Hun later during Dengizich’s (one of Attila’s younger sons) invasion of the Roman Empire in the late 460s describes vividly the Hunnic collection of taxes (tribute) from the Goths. The reminder of the indignities they had been forced to endure by these tax-collectors was enough to drive the Goths in the Hunnic army to rebel against their
masters.65 As in the case of the Xiongnu and other Inner Asian empires, the Empire of the Huns was not a ‘nomadic’ empire. It possessed an agricultural base. In Europe this base was made up of mainly the conquered populations in the Ukraine (like the Goths and others) who had practised agriculture from the time of the ancient Scythians. A not inconsiderable number of agricultural workers were also
imported into the empire from Roman territory (usually captives).66 That a government bureaucracy also existed can be assumed by the records of important roles given to ex-Roman defectors such as Rusticius, Constantius and Orestes (the father of the future Roman emperor Romulus Augustulus) at the court of Attila. The absorption of the Romanized population of conquered Pannonia and other Danubian provinces would no doubt have strengthened the
bureaucratic base of the Huns.67 As Altheim notes the Huns, contrary to what many expect, were not illiterate brutes either. The Huns may in fact have
possessed their own written script.68 Priscus reports that Hunnic secretaries read out names of fugitives who had fled to the Romans from Hunnic territory from a
written list.69 Altheim notes that the writing that was read was definitely neither Greek nor Latin. He suggests that the Oghuric Turkic runic writing system of the later Hunnic Bulgars, which we know from inscriptions in Bulgaria, was brought into Europe earlier from Central Asia by the Huns. Further possible evidence for Hunnic writing can be found in the Syriac chronicle of Zacharias of Mitylene who writes that in 5 0 7 or 5 0 8 AD bishop Qardust of Arran went to the land of the Caucasian Huns where he remained for seven years. He returned bringing with



him books in the H u nnic lan guage.
It has even been speculated th at the pow erful O negesius w h o w as held in such
h igh reg ard as to sit on the righ t o f the H u n nic king in b anq u ets, th at is the

strict stratification are b oth evident. Priscu s tells us a curious story about a H unnic
vassal horde along the shores o f the B lack Sea, the A katziri H uns. The disaffected
A katziri H uns w ere planning a revolt against A ttila, w ho had just overthrow n the
legitim ate suprem e king o f the H unnic E m pire, his elder b roth er Bleda, an act
w h ich m ay have caused the alienation o f the A katziri from the H unnic cen tral

likelihood had been u nder the ju risdiction o f Bleda, n ot A ttila, h ence th eir
e a g e r n e s s to a v e n g e th e ir m u r d e r e d m a s t e r .71
T he A katziri plans for revolt w ere actively encouraged by the R om ans. H ow ever, the R om an am bassadors m ade an error w hile distributing gifts from the
em p eror to the leaders o f the rebellion. K ouridachus, w h o w as senior in office

precedence clearly suggest th at the com plex, h ierarchical stratified system o f Inner
A sian govern an ce w as p ractised b y the H uns even at this tribal level. T he H uns
built up a govern m en tal apparatus th at w as quite unlike an yth in g found am on g
the earlier G erm an ic con fed eracies in the w est and even the G reuthungi
con fed eracy o f the G oths. This w as obviously their Inner A sian political legacy
th at th ey had inherited from the X ion gn u and other Inner A sian peoples th at had
preceded them . The in trodu ction o f H unnic political p ractices resulted in a tighter
political com m an d structure, precise ranks am on g govern m en t officials and



allocation of clearly defined roles to conquered peoples.74 Ellac’s appointment to rulership over the Akatziri also shows the steppe practice, noted among the earlier Xiongnu, of giving key fiefs to members of the royal family. Attila’s vast empire later splintered precisely because of bitter
disputes regarding the distribution of fiefs among his sons and relatives.75 We also
have the case of Laudaricus (Germanic: Laudareiks)76 who according to the Gallic
Chronicle o f 511 was a blood relative of Attila (cognatus Attilae).77 As Bona points out he was in all likelihood a vassal king of an affiliated Germanic tribe in the same way that Ellac was ruler over the eastern Akatziri and Edeco over the vassal
Sciri.78 Dualism, representing the two wings (Left and Right or east and west) of the traditional steppe imperial system, which we have already noted as a feature of Xiongnu kingship, was likewise very much a dominant feature of the Hunnic system in Europe. Again and again in Hunnic history we find two pre-eminent rulers. Ruga rules in the company of Octar, his brother, who is active primarily in
the western half of the Hunnic state, sometimes as the ally of Aetius.79 This suggests strongly that he was the ruler of the western half of the empire, while Ruga, who was quite clearly the more prominent king, in the traditional manner ruled the more dominant eastern half. Jordanes’ Getica (35.180) clearly states:
‘germani Octar et Roas, qui ante Attilam regnum tenuisse narrantur. In other words both Octar and Ruga held the kingship before Attila. They were followed in the Hunnic kingship by their nephews Bleda, who ruled the east, and Attila, who seems to have succeeded to Octar’s realm. That Attila ruled the western half seems to be corroborated by the note in Priscus that Attila was of the Gepid Huns (i.e. his personal fief was the Gepids situated in modern Hungary, the core of the
western half of the Hunnic Empire).80 Attila’s temporary sole kingship thus amounted to a ‘dictatorship’ which ran contrary to standard steppe practice. He of course soon apportioned control of the east to his son Ellac in the familiar dual system. Attila is called by Priscus the
praecipuus Hunnorum rex,81 the chief/high king of the Huns.82 Ellac was his deputy and his eastern co-ruler (dualism) and there were other sub-kings ruling over lesser sub-divisions of the empire. After a period of civil war and chaos following Attila’s death dualism again reasserted itself in the succession of Dengizich and Ernakh (west and east respectively) to the vacant Hunnic throne. The successors to the Hunnic Empire in the east, the Bulgar Huns also featured two wings, the Kutrigurs (west) and the Utigurs (east), ruled presumably by Ernakh’s descendants. Below the two kings of the dual system there was also another institution that was probably derived from the eastern steppes, maybe directly from the Xiongnu, an aristocratic council of six top-ranking nobles. When rendered in Turkic this institution would have been called Alti/Ultta (six) cur (nobles). In the Greek
transliteration this was rendered Oultizouroi.83 The name (or rather the title) of the Hunnic prince Ultzincur (ult=six, cur=lord), the cousin of Ernakh son of Attila, is further evidence in support of the existence of this body of six among the Huns. The College of six boliades (boyars/nobles) would also become the core political

argues th at this referen ce reflects the H unnic/steppe ideology o f the em p eror/K h agan b y heavenly m an d ate ruling over the four quarters o f the
world.86 Certainly this type of ideology appears in the later Turkic Orkhon inscriptions and there is no reason why it could not have existed among the Huns. However, the division between Scythia and Germania is a Roman geographical concept, not a Hunnic one. Thus the likelihood of these words reflecting any Hunnic steppe ideology is rather low. However, there is the possibility that Priscus is Romanizing a Hunnic chant for their dead ruler and has interpreted for his Roman readers Hunnic geographical concepts in a Roman way. That Attila is praised for his good fortune in Priscus, fir. 24 by the mourning Huns is also of interest. The Turkic Khagan in the Orkhon inscriptions holds the title iduq qut, literally holy luck/fortune. Divinely given good luck was one of the core attributes of an Inner Asian ruler, and Attila the Hun in Hunnic eyes was no exception to this.

5 ATTILA THE HUN
BLEDA AND ATTILA
The death of Ruga in 434 AD led to the succession of his nephews Bleda and Attila to the Hunnic throne. It is possible that Attila or some other senior royal had already been functioning as Octar’s replacement in the west before this time. Before his death in 434 AD ca. 433 AD Ruga seems to have made a committment to support Aetius in Gaul. The Huns under his nephews honoured this agreement and would continue to supply Aetius with troops until at least 439 A D , probably also thereafter as well until the mid 440s A D , as we shall see later. The Hunnic troops supplied to Aetius would enable him to reassert Roman authority in Gaul. The Huns were instrumental in the capture of Tibatto, the troublesome leader of the Bagaudae (Roman rebels) in 437 AD . That same year, as related earlier, the Huns destroyed the menacing Burgundians in alliance with Aetius. In a separate deployment a small contingent of Huns had also been dispatched to aid the Roman general Litorius in relieving Narbonne (a city in southern France) from the Visigoths. Aetius would inflict a critical defeat on the Visigoths in 438 A D , again with Hunnic support. A later foray against the Visigoths in 439 A D , however, failed and led to the death of Litorius who, according to Salvian, put his trust in the Huns, while the Goths put theirs in God! Nonetheless, despite this reverse the aid of the Huns had been decisive and the Visigothic threat was effectively contained. Aetius’ alliance with the Huns had paid off handsomely. Gaul was largely back under firm Roman control after the chaos of the early fifth century. The Visigoths, Alans, Burgundians and Franks as well as the troublesome Bagaudae in northern Gaul had all by and large been brought to heel by the power of the Huns. The military situation for both halves of the Roman Empire was more promising in the opening years of the 440s, than it had been in nearly half a century. In 441 AD both the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire were readying themselves for the major push to annihilate the Vandals-Alans (they had earlier penetrated Roman territory and settled in North Africa) who were the most problematic group of barbarians to have entered the empire.

A T T ILA AS TH E SU PREM E R U LER
Up to this time the principal king of the Huns was without doubt Bleda, who ruled the eastern half of the Hunnic Empire. Then some time between 442 AD and 447 AD (probably ca. 444-5 A D ) Attila assassinated his brother and usurped the position of supreme ruler. The Hun state just like the old Empire of Xiongnu was very much characterized by federalism and collective rule among members of the royal clan. Although steppe empires did have a supreme ruler who was an autocrat in theory, tyranny or monopolization of power by an over-zealous ruler could and did at times lead to deadly rebellions and overthrow of the ruling monarch. An example in the Xiongnu context is the overthrow of the Shanyu Wuyen-chü-t’i, who tried to centralize all political power to himself in violation of the traditional rights of the Xiongnu nobility (Han Shu 94A: 35b-38b). Attila’s violent usurpation and his autocracy like that of Wu-yen-chü-t’i, who was also a usurper, are likely to have been the root cause of the disorder that followed his death later. Opposition to his authoritarianism was already manifest during his reign, as shown by the desertion of royal princes of the blood such as Mama and Atakam to the Romans. These unfortunate Hun royals were soon handed over to Attila by the defeated emperor in Constantinople or killed by the Romans when
th ey refused to be handed over to A ttila.3
A fter assum ing the position o f suprem e ruler, A ttila renew ed the w ar against
th e R om an s in 4 4 7 AD. T his tim e th e fight w as a relatively fair one w ith n eith er
em pire burdened by either subterfuge or a second front. O ur sources indicate that
this war was much greater than the earlier war of 441-2 A D .4 Within the year all Roman forces in the Balkans were simply annihilated. The East Roman field army in full force fought against the Huns and was systematically wiped out. Attila after having destroyed the Roman army under the Gothic commander Arnegisclus near the river Utus and sacked their base of operation, Marcianople, then trapped and destroyed the last field army immediately available to the Eastern Roman Empire (presumably under the command of generals Aspar and Areobindus, Arnegisclus having died in battle at Utus) at Chersonesus (Gallipoli). Theophanes reports that all three generals were badly defeated and Attila advanced to ‘both seas’, the Black Sea and the Hellespont, forcing the Eastern Roman emperor

o f b arb arian s righ t up to the end o f the fifth cen tu ry .8 M arcellinus C om es, a sixth cen tu ry AD ch ronicler, sum m ed up the w hole disaster in the follow ing w ay:



Ingens bellum et priore maius per Attilam regem nostris inflictum paene totam Europam excisis invasisque civitatibus atque castellis conrasit/A mighty war, greater than the previous one, was brought upon us by king Attila. It devastated almost the whole of Europe and cities and forts were invaded and pillaged.9
Priscus adds fu rther details about the ou tcom e o f the conflict:
The Romans pretended that they had made the agreements (i.e to increase payments of tribute) voluntarily, but because of the overwhelming fear which gripped their commanders they were compelled to accept gladly every injunction, however harsh, in their eagerness for peace.10
The Romans agreed to pay a lump sum of 8,100 pounds of gold immediately to the Hunnic king personally and also pay unspecified amounts to ransom the immense number of prisoners of war taken by the Huns (even payment of ransoms for Roman prisoners who had fled Hunnic territory and were no longer under Hunnic
jurisdiction was also one of the provisions of the peace treaty).11 Priscus with perhaps a touch of hyperbole reports that the Romans were reduced to such dire straits that senators were compelled to sell their wives’ jewellery, rich men their furniture and some were even driven to suicide because they could not meet the required contributions demanded from them by the emperor for the payment of tribute to the Huns. The additional expenses needed to rebuild the army from scratch, repair the destroyed fortifications and defences in the Balkans, and the loss of revenue from the devastated provinces indeed may have stretched imperial
finances temporarily to a breaking point.12 Even more critical was another condition of the peace treaty after the war of
4 4 7 A D .13 The Romans were forced to accept the Hunnic occupation of a wide belt of territory south of the Danube stretching from Singidunum on the frontier of Pannonia to Novae, some 300 miles distance and five days’ journey in depth, i.e. 100-120 miles. All of Dacia Ripensis and parts of three other Balkan provinces were thus in Hunnic hands. It has been argued that these annexed territories south of the Danube were given back to the Romans by Attila after the embassy of Anatolius and Nomus in 4 4 9 AD . Attila indeed did agree to withdraw from Roman territory. However, subsequent events show that Attila did not in fact abandon the Roman territory that he had occupied. Especially since Theodosius with whom he had negotiated died the following year and was succeeded by Marcian who immediately abrogated the terms of the treaty agreed between Attila and Theodosius. This incurred the wrath of Attila. However, fortunately for the Eastern Roman Empire, Attila’s gaze was now already turned in a different direction, towards his old ally Aetius in the west.
A T T IL A IN V A D ES T H E W E S T
Until the mid 440s AD Aetius and the Huns had been the best of allies. Therefore, the sudden souring of relations between Attila and Aetius and the former’s decision to invade Gaul to destroy his erstwhile ally requires some explanation. The purpose of the Hunnic campaign against the Western Roman Empire in 451 AD has long been misinterpreted due to a hopelessly distorted narrative of the war left to us by one of our principal sources, the Goth Jordanes. Jordanes, whose main interest was the glorification of the role of his Goths in the conflict, attributes the entire Hunnic campaign to the machinations of Geiseric, the king of the Vandals



and Alans in North Africa. According to Jordanes’ version of events Geiseric was fearful of the wrath of Theodorid, the Visigothic king, because of the barbarous cruelty inflicted on Theodorid’s daughter (Geiseric’s daughter-in-law) by Geiseric himself and his son Huneric. He, therefore, in order to escape a Visigothic punitive invasion had supposedly bribed Attila to attack Toulouse (the Visigothic capital). The entire story is of course quite implausible since the Visigoths in 4 5 1 AD hardly had the power to threaten the Vandals in any way. The Vandal kingdom was situated across the Mediterranean Sea and the Goths had no navy! Was Geiseric then fearful that maybe the Visigoths would join forces with the Western Romans and utilize the Roman fleet against him? Perhaps, but then why would the Huns agree to attack Toulouse just to please Geiseric? In fact Jordanes himself makes this tale of bribery on the part of Geiseric superfluous by mentioning that Attila had already thought long about such a campaign (Getica 36 1 8 5 ). Jordanes was simply exaggerating the contemporary significance of the Visigoths by making them the ultimate target of Attila’s invasion.
A fragment of Priscus, the authenticity of which is highly doubtful,14 also asserts that Attila decided to attack the Western Roman Empire to gain Honoria and her wealth and to attack the Goths to do a favour to Geiseric. According to what sounds like spurious court gossip in Constantinople, Honoria, the scandalridden sister of the then reigning Western Roman emperor, the indolent and incompetent Valentinian III, had secretly proposed marriage (or what was interpreted as such) to Attila the Hun, allegedly in order to escape an unwanted marriage being enforced on her by her brother. Attila was said to have demanded from Valentinian half of the Western Roman Empire as Honoria’s dowry, a demand which Valentinian obviously could not accept. According to this story, Attila then led his army into Roman territory to rescue his ‘damsel in distress’ from her brother and to claim her enormous dowry. Did Attila really invade Gaul to claim his wanton bride (Honoria was presumably in Italy, so he perhaps took a detour?) and at the same time also to help Geiseric get away with abusing another poor damsel in distress? This is certainly fit for a soap opera or a medieval romance, but surely the notion of the Hunnic king rushing to rescue one damsel in distress at the expense of perpetuating the distress of another damsel is slightly contradictory? Leaving these ridiculous stories aside, the real purpose of the campaign into Gaul and the intended target becomes more obvious in another more genuine fragment of Priscus. The fragment tells us that the initial clashes occurred around the issue of the Frankish succession. By the mid 440s AD Aetius’ control over Gaul had been secured with Hunnic support. However, he then began to meddle in Frankish internal affairs along the Rhine region. It is evident that both Aetius and Attila regarded the Franks as belonging to their sphere of influence and sure enough Priscus tells us that Aetius and Attila, both looking to control the Franks, had supported different candidates to the Frankish (most likely Salian Frankish

with open arms. Clearly the relations between the Hun king and Aetius were deteriorating fast and the fact that Aetius had to resort to Alan troops and not the Huns to suppress the Bagaudae (he had used the Huns to suppress a similar revolt earlier in 437 AD) indicates that the Hun troops that had earlier been the backbone of his military in Gaul were no longer available for his use due to the increasing hostility between him and Attila. One can also hazard a conjecture that the alliance with Aetius was more favoured by Bleda and Aetius was not supportive of Attila’s overthrow of Bleda in either 444 AD or 445 AD, hence the cooling of relations between the Huns and the Western Romans. After 445 AD we see Aetius conducting military campaigns with the assistance of Alans and Goths rather than the Huns. The Goths, however, were fickle allies and in 446 AD their treason cost the Romans their campaign against the Germanic Suebi in Spain. On the eve of the Hunnic invasion of Gaul the Goths and the Romans were again at loggerheads, and contrary to what Jordanes says there was no real reason as to why Attila, whose principal enemy was Aetius, would have chosen to target the Visigoths who were also at odds with Aetius. However, as Priscus makes abundantly clear, although Attila’s main aim was the securing of Hunnic influence among the Franks along the Rhine, this was interpreted by the contemporary Romans as merely a prelude to the takeover of
nothing less than half of the Western Roman Empire.16 Such fears were compounded by the belligerent rhetoric coming from Attila himself. John Malalas and the Paschal Chronicle tell us that a Hunnic envoy told the Western Roman emperor Valentinian III that Attila the Hun king was the lord and master of both
himself and the Roman emperors (!).17 Fear of complete Hunnic conquest of all of Gaul, probably propagated by Aetius himself in order to win allies, was what persuaded the Visigoths to join the Romans rather than side with the Huns. They may have felt that they too would soon be next on the Hun hit list. Although by this stage the conquest of the Western Roman Empire was militarily feasible for the Hunnic ruler, a careful examination of Hunnic policy towards Rome shows a distinct unwillingness on the part of the Huns to permanently occupy Roman territory. For instance Attila abandoned most of his Balkan conquests after his overwhelming victory over the Eastern Roman Empire in 447 AD and satisfied himself with setting up a defensive ring around his core territory by creating a series of Hunnic fiefs south of the Danube, which he then officially claimed as Hunnic territory. Even this narrow strip of Roman territory that he had annexed he quickly showed a willingness to give back to the Romans. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the aim of the Hunnic invasion was the conquest of all of the Western Roman Empire or even all of Gaul. The core aims of Hunnic foreign policy all throughout seem to have been to prevent conquered subjects within the Hunnic Empire from defecting to the Romans, to create a defensive ring of ‘barbarian’ vassals around Hunnic core territories and to subject the Roman Empire to vassalage and the payment of tribute (somewhat reminiscent of the policy adopted by the Xiongnu ancestors of the European Huns towards another great empire, that of the Han Chinese much earlier in East Asia, which we have discussed earlier). The limited aims of the Gallic campaign in line with this policy seem to have been to consolidate Hunnic control over all barbarians within what Attila regarded as the Hunnic sphere of influence, i.e. the tribes of the Rhine region (mainly the Franks) and to subject the



Western Roman Empire to tribute. That the first of the main objectives was the Franks is confirmed by the route taken by the Hunnic army in their invasion of Gaul. Tournai, Cologne and Trier, all areas with heavy presence of Franks, were attacked first and captured by the Hun king. The strategy of the campaign, as in the case of the war with the Eastern Roman Empire, called for a clear military victory over the main army of the Western Roman Empire (in this case the army of Aetius in Gaul, hence the prior invasion of Gaul over the more tempting target of Italy where the Western Roman government was situated) in order to force other barbarians leaning towards the Romans into obedience and to stop the Romans from accepting defectors and fugitives from the Hunnic Empire. This would then be followed by a coordinated invasion of Italy itself to force the Western Roman emperor into vassalage and the payment of tribute. Accordingly Attila’s army erupted into Gaul in 451 AD, conquered the disputed territory of the Franks from the Romans and then proceeded further west to engage Aetius in a decisive battle. However, Aetius despite securing the alliance of the Visigoths still avoided battle and retreated deeper into Gaul, sensing no doubt his military inferiority visa-vis the Huns. An unexpected event occurred however at Orleans where the Alans, who had by now become the mainstay of Roman power in Gaul, put up a ferocious resistance to the Hunnic siege of that city. That the Alans were targeted for a punitive strike by Attila is interesting in that it supports the analysis that the Visigoths were far from the main target of Attila’s invasion. The main target was of course Aetius and the Alans were the core of Aetius’ military power in Gaul. The siege dragged on indefinitely and Attila for reasons that are unclear raised the siege and started to return to his home base in Hungary. In all likelihood the campaigning season was drawing to a close and Attila decided to leave in accordance with standard Hunnic practice. The spectre of the Huns withdrawing was however enough to incite Aetius and the Visigoths into action. Uniting with the gallant Alans who had defended Orleans they chased the Huns and caught up with them at Chalons. The battle of Chalons that followed has often been called one of the most decisive battles in history. Yet from the perspective of the entire war between the Huns and the Western Romans, the battle was hardly the climax or even the most important engagement of the war. However, despite this historical reality, it is popularly thought that the battle was one of those ‘defining moments’ of history that saved Western Christendom/Civilization from ‘Asiatic’ ‘barbarism’. The depiction of the battle in this manner commenced in the nineteenth century and continued right up to the middle of the twentieth century. More recently the battle has been analyzed as a Hunnic defeat that broke the myth of Hunnic
invincibility18 or as The Cambridge Illustrated History o f Warfare, with the
subtitle The Triumph o f the West, asserts, a decisive triumph of Roman defensive
strategy.19 The rationale underlying this emphasis on the Roman or Gothic ‘victory’ over the Huns is the erroneous belief which simply assumes that a Hunnic victory and conquest of Europe would have been an unmitigated catastrophe for civilization. If this was the case, what are we then to make of the fact that virtually the whole of Europe with the exception of its maritime fringes had been under Hunnic rule for three-quarters of a century by this stage? As we will see in the final chapter, the experience of Hunnic conquest was certainly not



a pleasant one (but then was any conquest by any power in history pleasant for the conquered?), yet the effects of Hunnic rule on Germanic Europe was far from purely negative. Returning to the battle, the two armies that faced each other at Chalons were remarkably similar to each other. Both had a core of Inner Asian cavalry: the Alans of Goar on the Roman side and the Huns-Alans on the Hunnic side. It is likely that there was even a very small contingent of Huns in Aetius’ army as well, leftovers from the decades of Hunnic collaboration with the Romans, Huns who naturally would have been regarded as deserters or rebels by the Hun king. The Greuthungi Goths (later to become the core group of the Ostrogoths) and other eastern Germanic peoples like the Gepids fought for Attila, their cousins the Visigoths for Aetius and the Romans. The western Germanic tribes such as the Franks and the Burgundians featured in both armies. Finally there was the GalloRoman contingent of Aetius’ army and very likely also some of their fellow GalloRomans (the Bagaudae) on the other side supporting Attila. In other words whichever side prevailed in this battle would not have made a big difference to the nature of Europe that followed. The essential components of a post-Roman Europe were all there on both sides of the battlefield. One noticeable difference would have been the appearance of the opposing commanding generals. If Jordanes is to be believed, Attila, as befits his origins,
had a Mongoloid appearance of sorts.20 However, the vast majority of his entourage and troops were overwhelmingly European. The battle of Chalons was certainly no race war and it definitely wasn’t a religious one either. Both armies contained both Christians and pagans. The Huns themselves like all Inner Asian peoples were pluralistic when it came to religion and were in fact more tolerant than contemporary Romans towards religious diversity within their empire. If the battle of Chalons had no racial, religious or even cultural significance, then what is its significance? The most pertinent consequence of the battle was the virtual annihilation of what was left of the Western Roman military establishment. Regardless of how one sees the results of the battle, it is difficult to ignore the fact that after this battle the Western Roman army is not an imperial army of Roman troops (some of course already of foreign origin, but nonetheless fully integrated into the Roman military system). Henceforth it devolved into hired mercenary forces commanded by clearly un-Romanized, unintegrated barbarian kings/chiefs and their retinues who were in no way completely dependent on or even remotely loyal to the imperial government and the Roman state. The actual outcome of the battle itself is murky due to the unreliability of most of our surviving Greco-Roman sources. Jordanes, who is the principal source of the specific details concerning the course of the battle, is a late source, written around 100 years after the event. To make things worse Jordanes heavily distorted and altered the more reliable original account of the battle in Priscus, which is now unfortunately mostly lost with the exception of a badly preserved fragment.
For instance the fragment of Priscus 21.121 tells us that Theodorid, the Visigothic king, was killed by an arrow, not from a fall from his horse as Jordanes would
have it. As Barnish22 accurately observes, Jordanes carried out ‘a major proGothic reshaping’ of the original account of the invasion written by Priscus. Barnish may also be correct in suggesting that the narrative of the battle found in



the Getica has also been coloured by Cassiodorus’ literary account, which also had a vested interest in glorifying the deeds of the Goths (Cassiodorus was an official in the service of Theodoric, the Ostrogothic king of Italy, in the sixth century AD). Jordanes is furthermore known for using the enemies of the Goths such as the Huns and Vandals as a literary device for highlighting the valour and greatness of his Goths. The reliability of his narrative therefore is highly questionable whenever battles involving Goths are related. By way of example Jordanes even went so far as to invent a phantom Vandal kingdom north of the Danube in the early fourth century AD in order to attribute a great victory over the Vandals to an
equally fictitious ancient Gothic king called Geberich (Getica 22.113-5).23 Jordanes
in Getica 31.161 and Romana 322 also invents the bizarre scenario of the Alans and Vandals fleeing Pannonia and invading Gaul (in 406 AD) because they feared the military might of the Visigoths and also feared their return. Opinion on who actually won the battle is divided among scholars with most advocating a Roman-Visigothic victory, Goffart (1988) and Vernadsky (1951) suggesting that the battle of Chalons was militarily indecisive, and a minority favouring a Hunnic victory. What is noteworthy in Jordanes’ highly unreliable account is that the credit for the ‘victory’ over the Huns is given almost solely to the Visigoths while the Western Romans under Aetius, who were the main target of the Hun expedition, and the Alans who actually fought the most formidable Hunnic contingent within Attila’s army in the centre of the battlefield, receive scarcely any attention at all in the battle narrative. The only undisputed facts that can be gleaned from Jordanes’ account is that Theodorid the king of the Visigoths
was slain at the beginning of the battle24 and that the Visigoths retreated after the battle to their homebase in Toulouse, leaving the battlefield in the possession of the Huns. Quite obviously these facts do not appear to fit the narrative of a glorious Visigothic victory. In antiquity the death of the commanding general usually meant defeat for the army concerned and victory was always claimed by the side in possession of the battlefield after the battle, in this case the Huns. Jordanes in order to skirt around these awkward details attributes the hasty withdrawal of the Visigoths after the battle to Thorismud’s (the new Visigothic king after the death of Theoderid) anxiety over his inheritance in Toulouse and the machinations of the crafty Aetius who persuaded Thorismud to let the Huns return home unmolested because he now feared the overwhelming power of the Visigoths and
needed the Huns as a counterweight.25 This version of events, however, is quite clearly a product of literary embellishment added to the battle narrative either by Cassiodorus or Jordanes himself to make Aetius the new crafty Themistocles (the hero of the Greek resistance during the Persian Wars of the fifth century BC, whose exploits are recorded in the Histories of the Greek historian Herodotus). The Herodotean colouring given to Jordanes’ narrative was noticed very early by Wallace-Hadrill who observed the similarity of Aetius’ ploy with the unending deceptions, underhandedness and intrigues of Themistocles in Herodotus’
narrative of the Greek defeat of the Persians.26 That the Chalons battle narrative in Jordanes is not a factual account of the real battle, but a literary construct based ultimately on a tradition harking back to Herodotus’ narrative is made even more obvious by its structure. As in Herodotus’ retelling of the Battle of Marathon (an



Athenian Greek victory over the Persians), the Huns of Jordanes like the Persians of Herodotus are situated in the middle. The weak Athenian centre in Herodotus, like the supposedly ‘unreliable’ Alans in Jordanes, who were allegedly placed between the Romans and the Goths because Aetius held them to be suspect, breaks under Persian/Hun pressure. This however allows the two wings to sandwich the Huns/Persians in the centre and save the day. In both accounts no particular credit is given to the left wing (Plataeans/Romans) and all glory is bestowed on the heroic right wing (Goths under Theodorid and the main Athenian army under the war archon Callimachus). Both Theodorid and Callimachus, as if by coincidence, get killed during the battle, leaving the hero Miltiades/Thorismud to secure victory. Then after the victory the Athenians/Goths rapidly return to their home city Athens/Toulouse to secure it from the Persian navy which is aided by Athenian traitors who send a signal by
raising a shield/sedition at home threatening Thorismud.27 The sequence of events, troop deployments and deeds attributed to participants in Jordanes’ narrative exactly matches that of the Marathon narrative. This is not a coincidence and all this suggests that the information provided by Jordanes regarding the behaviour of key figures in the battle is in most cases artificial, literary constructs. Interestingly we discover in Jordanes’ narrative the curious situation of both Thorismud (Gothic commander after the death of Theodorid, his father) and Aetius losing track of their armies during the battle. According to Jordanes the two commanders had routed the Huns during the day and this forced Attila to withdraw behind the protective ring of his wagon train in desperation. Jordanes then famously makes Attila contemplate suicide via self-immolation on a pile of horse saddles. However, contrary to this image of Roman-Gothic triumph we see both Aetius and Thorismud becoming separated from their respective commands. Thorismud somewhat inexplicably ends up among the Huns during the night after the battle. He is almost killed and dragged from his horse by the Huns before
being rescued by his followers.28 Aetius also finds himself separated from his men in the confusion of night and wanders about in the midst of the enemy (i.e. Huns, noctis confusione divisus cum inter hostes medius vagaretur), until he finds refuge in the Visigothic camp. He feared, according to Jordanes himself, that a disaster
had happened.29 If the day had ended in a Roman-Visigoth victory, as Jordanes insists, it is difficult to understand how both allied commanders could have simultaneously lost track of their armies and ended up among the Huns. It is clear that these details we find in Jordanes more properly describe not a situation in which the Goths and the Romans are chasing the routed Huns into their camp, but rather the Huns chasing the fugitive allies who had been defeated into the Roman camp. It was presumably during this rout that both Aetius and Thorismud became separated from their rapidly disintegrating armies. That this is actually the real picture is confirmed by the rather curious piece of information in Jordanes that the Huns, after their supposed ‘defeat’, were unable to approach the Roman camp
because of the hail of arrows from the Romans.30 After the battle the camp that experienced a siege was not the Hunnic camp, but the Roman one. Who the victors actually were can easily be guessed. This analysis of the battle is supported



by the fact that the Visigoths, as mentioned earlier, retreat to Toulouse immediately after the battle and Aetius the overall commander sends away his
Frankish allies.31 What is more, the only archaeological relic of the battle found near Chalons is a Hunnic cauldron. This may again be an indication that the Huns had possession of the battlefield after the battle. The cauldron was used probably for the burial of Attila’s relative Laudaricus, the most high-ranking battle casualty on the Hun
side, after the battle.32 Other Greco-Roman sources are either cursory or ambiguous about the results of the great battle. The Gallic Chronicle o f 452 talks about the great slaughter,
gravi clade inflicta, and nothing else. It attributes victory to the Romans. The
Chronicle o f 511 however, which without a doubt used the earlier chronicle as a source, does not mention a Roman victory or a Hunnic defeat and writes that the Patrician Aetius and Theodoric, king of the Goths fought against Attila, king of the Huns at Mauriacus where Theodoric and Laudaricus, a blood relative of Attila,
were killed.33 The more precise and accurate details that this latter chronicle provides indicate that it is based on a more reliable source/sources than the terse details found in the Chronicle o f 452, and is probably a reflection of the actual situation. The fact that Attila chose to return with most of his army to his home base in the Danubian region after the battle led chroniclers like the Gallic chronicler of 452, the contemporary Roman poet Sidonius Apollinaris and the bishop Hydatius based in Spain (as well as many modern historians) to attribute a pyrrhic victory to the Romans. Prosper of Aquitaine, a contemporary source, provides us with the clearest insight into how the Romans assessed the outcome of the battle. Prosper records that the slaughter was incalculable - for neither side gave way - and (it appears that the Huns were defeated in this battle because
those among them that survived lost their taste for fighting and turned back
h o m e.34 In other words the Romans claimed victory, not because the outcome necessarily favoured them, but because the main Hunnic army returned home without advancing further into Gaul. This was interpreted as a victory and Aetius and the Visigoths were credited with having ‘stopped’ the Huns. However, as already noted earlier the Huns did not commence their march eastward to their home territory due to the results of the battle of Chalons. After a long, drawn out siege at Orleans that failed due to the tenacity of Alan resistance and otherwise having largely fulfilled his initial objectives, that is the conquest of the Franks, (although the reluctance of Aetius to engage him in battle until that point had deprived him of the decisive encounter he had wanted) Attila was already withdrawing east when Aetius and the Visigoths suddenly gave chase. Quite obviously the Romans must have interpreted the Hunnic withdrawal as an opportunity for a counter-attack and they leapt at the chance to hit the ‘retreating’ Huns. What is interesting is that steppe armies throughout history employed the tactic of the feigned retreat to deceive a cautious enemy, reluctant to commit troops to battle, into attacking. The battle of Chalons could therefore either be the result of a feigned retreat (typical steppe strategy) by the Huns in order to draw the evasive Romans into a decisive battle or a pursuit by the allied army under Aetius of the Hunnic army already returning to winter bases in Hungary.



Therefore, the return of the main Hunnic army to the Danubian region was by no means the result of a military defeat. The main body of the Huns, as was their standard practice, simply returned to their home base after the successful conclusion of the campaigning season. We see this pattern also in Attila’s campaign against the Eastern Romans in 447 AD and again in the following Italian campaign of 452 AD, when he withdrew from Italy without taking either Ravenna or Rome, which lay defenceless before his army. Furthermore, the Huns did not in fact completely withdraw from Gaul after Chalons. Jordanes records a story about the Visigoths beating off a second Hunnic invasion, after Chalons and the Hunnic invasion of Italy in 452 AD (Getica 43.2268). Historians have pointed out that from a military point of view this is highly implausible, since two invasions from Hungary in the same year are not likely to be feasible. It is clear then that this force that attacked the Visigoths and Alans in central Gaul cannot be the main Hunnic force that invaded Italy in that same year. They were a contingent of Huns left behind in Gaul to mop up the situation after the departure of the main Hunnic force in 451 AD. The fact that the battle takes place in the Loire region further west than Chalons is again indicative of the fact that the battle of Chalons had ended in a Hunnic victory which allowed this Hunnic force to penetrate further west in the following year. That the war in Gaul had ended in a Hunnic victory is further supported by the fact that when in 452 AD Attila invaded Italy, Aetius was not able to offer him any resistance. The Gallic Chronicle o f 452 records that resistance to the Huns
collapsed completely and Aetius forever lost his auctoritas.35 Aetius actually advised the emperor to abandon Italy altogether to escape the Hunnic onslaught. The Hydatius Chronicle, which is hardly reliable, records that Marcian, the Eastern Roman emperor, sent auxiliaries to assist Aetius and invents the pleasant fiction that the Huns were slaughtered by plague and the army of Marcian: missis
per Marcianum principem Aetio duce caeduntur auxiliis pariterque in sedibus suis
et caelestibus plagis et per Marciani subiuguntur exercitum. Hydatius in the above passage even seems to contemplate an Eastern Roman invasion of Hunnic territory north of the Danube (if sedibus suis is indicating Hunnic home territory north of the Danube that is) in 452 AD by Marcian’s East Roman army. This of course clearly cannot be true because the old East Roman territory south of the Danube was still beyond Eastern Roman government control years later in the mid 450s. The region was under the control of the Huns and their subjects who had moved into the area after or more likely before the abrogation of the treaty agreed to between Attila and the Roman envoys Anatolius and Nomus by Emperor Marcian in 450 AD. Hydatius was indulging in wishful thinking, since there is no record elsewhere of any Roman resistance in Italy. Prosper gives us an entirely different picture from Hydatius about the actual realities of 452 AD. He notes that the emperor, senate and people of Rome could think of no other way
out of the danger except submission and the payment of tribute to the Huns.36 The Gallic Chronicles of 452 and 511 also have nothing to say about the efforts of Aetius and Marcian to defend Italy, which were undoubtedly negligible. There are no records of any victories won by the Romans in open battle with the Huns. Marcian probably just claimed victory because the Huns at the end of their



campaigning season, as was their standard practice, withdrew to winter quarters in Hungary, laden with plunder and tribute from the bishop of Rome. Since subjecting the Romans to tribute and vassalage was the main aim of the Hunnic invasion, it can be said that the campaign was largely a successful one for Attila and his Huns. Indeed Priscus, who is almost always more reliable than other contemporary sources when it comes to the Huns, sums up the events of 452 as follows: after having ‘enslaved Italy’ Attila returned to his own territories. No hint of any defeat or military reverse suffered by the Huns is present in Priscus. Furthermore, contrary to the bravado of Hydatius, according to Priscus, who being an Eastern Roman is certainly more reliable a source concerning matters in the east than Hydatius who was far away west in Spain, the supposedly victorious
Marcian dreaded the coming encounter with the Huns in 453 AD.37 This is far from the image of a triumphal emperor that one would expect, if Hydatius’ account of multiple Roman victories was true. As in the case of the emperor Theodosius who preceded him, Marcian, according to Priscus, was saved by divine intervention, the incredible good luck of Attila dying in 453 AD right before his intended attack on Constantinople. The civil war within the Hunnic Empire that followed nullified for a while the threat from the Huns. That the East Romans were hardly capable of resisting the Huns in 453 AD is shown by the fact that Roman reoccupation of territory seized by the Huns south of the Danube only began ca. 458 AD nearly four years after the commencement of
the Hunnic civil war38 and five years after the death of Attila. More than ten years after the death of Attila and the fragmentation of the Hunnic Empire, the Eastern Romans were still having difficulty containing even a minor Hunnic warlord such as Hormidac who operated well south of the Danube and sacked the city of Sardica. The disastrous effect that the Hunnic invasions had on both halves of the Roman Empire is clearly shown by what happened in 454 AD. The Vandal king Geiseric invaded Italy and went on to sack Rome with a ferocity that would make the name Vandal infamous. Neither of the emperors could do anything about this outrage. It was not until 467 AD that the Eastern Roman Empire could again assemble its forces for a punitive expedition against the Vandals. The military losses incurred by the defeats Rome suffered at the hands of Attila the Hun left the Roman army largely impotent for well over a decade. Quite fittingly Attila’s foes, the Romans and the Goths, through whose words we are forced to reconstruct the history of the Huns, have described the final demise of the Hunnic king in suitably dramatic language. According to Jordanes, who is citing Priscus:
he took in marriage a very beautiful girl named Ildico, after countless other wives, as was the custom of his race. He had given himself up to excessive joy at his wedding, and as he lay on his back, heavy with wine and sleep, a rush of superfluous blood, which would ordinarily have flowed from his nose, streamed in deadly course down his throat and killed him, since it was hindered in the usual passages. Thus did drunkenness put a disgraceful end to a king renowned in war. On the following day, when a great part of the morning was spent, the royal attendants suspected some ill and, after a great uproar, broke in the doors. There they found the death of Attila accomplished by an effusion of blood, without any wound, and the girl with downcast face weeping beneath her veil. Then, as is the custom of that race, they plucked out the hair of their heads and made their faces hideous with deep wounds, that the renowned warrior might be mourned, not by effeminate wailings and tears, but by the blood of men. Moreover a wondrous thing took place in connection with Attila’s death. For in a dream some god stood at the side of Marcian, emperor of the east, while he was disquieted about his fierce foe, and showed him the bow of Attila broken in that same night, as if to intimate that the race of Huns owed much to that weapon. This account the historian Priscus says he accepts upon truthful evidence. For so terrible was



Attila thought to be to great empires that the gods announced his death to rulers as a special boon. We shall not omit to say a few words about the many ways in which his shade was honored by his race. His body was placed in the midst of a plain and lay in state in a silken tent as a sight for men’s admiration. The best horsemen of the entire tribe of the Huns rode around in circles, after the manner of circus games, in the place to which he had been brought and told of his deeds in a funeral dirge in the following manner: ‘The chief of the Huns, King Attila, bom of his sire Mundiuch, lord of bravest tribes, sole possessor of the Scythian and German realms - powers unknown before - captured cities and terrified both empires of the Roman world and, appeased by their prayers, took annual tribute to save the rest from plunder. And when he had accomplished all this by the favor of fortune, he fell, not by wound of the foe, nor by treachery of friends, but in the midst of his nation at peace, happy in his joy and without sense of pain. Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?’ When they had mourned him with such lamentations, a strava, as they call it, was celebrated over his tomb with great revelling. They gave w ay in turn to the extremes of feeling and displayed funereal grief alternating with joy. Then in the secrecy of night they buried his body in the earth. They bound his coffins, the first with gold, the second with silver and the third with the strength of iron, showing by such means that these three things suited the mightiest of kings; iron because he subdued the nations, gold and silver because he received the honors of both empires. They also added the arms of foemen won in the fight, trappings of rare worth, sparkling with various gems, and ornaments of all sorts whereby princely state is maintained. And that so great riches might be kept from human curiosity, they slew those appointed to the work - a dreadful pay for their labor; and thus sudden death was the lot of those who buried him as well as of him who was buried.
(G etica 49.254-8, translation from Charles C. Mierow)
The death of the great Hun king was also celebrated in Norse mythology via the legend of Gudrun, a femme fatale who marries Atli (Attila), but ends up assassinating him and her sons by Atli in revenge for the deaths of her family members slain earlier by Atli. Curiously enough the name Atli became one of the alternative names of the Norse deity Thor, the son of Odin. Odin himself would later be portrayed as a conquerer from Asia whose sons were given Sweden and Denmark as personal possessions. Attila and his Huns were evidently already the subjects of legend in the Early Middle Ages. In the famous Nibelungenlied Attila again appears in Germanic legend as the noble king Etzel of the Huns. Here he is not assassinated by his wife as in the Gudrun saga, but is the last man standing after the bloodbath unleashed by his vengeful wife Kriemhild on the Burgundians. The annihilation of the historic Burgundians by the Huns during the time of Attila is thought to have facilitated the creation this later legend.

6 THE HUNS AFTER ATTILA
HUNNIC CIVIL WAR AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HUNNIC EMPIRE
The death of Attila the Hun was followed by a bitter civil war between his many sons and other powerful Hunnic nobles over the vast inheritance that he had left behind. Until the death of Attila, the Hunnic Empire had for around 80 years continued to expand over most of continental Europe at a breathtaking speed. This continued unrelenting expansion is indicative of the relative absence of serious internal political conflict. The demands made by the Hunnic kings Bleda and Attila to the Romans requesting the return of fugitives from the Hunnic Empire show that as in most other steppe empires the Hunnic Empire regularly witnessed political purges upon the accession of a new ruler, who in order to consolidate power clamped down on establishment figures from the previous reign whose positions now needed to be redistributed to the next generation of grandees. This is hardly exceptional in imperial politics and the occasional execution of disaffected or disenfranchised noblemen or minor princes hardly affected the stability of the Hun Empire. However, Attila’s ascent to supreme power in the mid 440s AD drastically shook the fundamental make-up of the Hun state. Not only did he violently usurp the throne from the supreme ruler (that is his brother Bleda), but in order to successfully carry out his usurpation of power he seems to have relied inordinately on the support of the tribal groups in the western half of the Hun state such as the Gepids to suppress the eastern tribes that supported Bleda. Attila was so dependent on the Gepids that one Greco-Roman source actually calls him a
G epid H u n .1 These w estern tribes, principally grouped arou n d H u n gary, had until
the usurpation o f A ttila been the fringe elem ents w ithin the H unnic p ow er
structure, w h ich had favou red the eastern tribes in the U k rainian steppe zone. T h at the u su rp ation o f A ttila w as no m in o r p alace affair like all p reviou s p olitical

the reign o f A ttila one sees consistently the favouring o f nobles from the w est o f
the H unnic Em pire over those from the east. A ttila’s key nobles O negesius,
A rd aric, Edeco, and V alam er w ere all w estern notables w hose pow er base w as
located close to the C arp ath ian basin to w h ich A ttila n ow p erm an en tly m oved the

w est (w ho had enjoyed the lim elight at the very h eart o f the H un Em pire under
A ttila) and the oth er headed b y the A katziri in the east (w ho had been disaffected
and exclu d ed from the cen tres o f p o w er upon B led a’s assassin ation b y A ttila and



now wished to make a comeback). Attila’s usurpation and favouring of the west over the east, which reversed the traditional alignment and distribution of power within steppe empires therefore had catastrophic consequences for the political stability of the Hun Empire after his death, as well as the sudden nature of his death which left him no time to resolve the issue of succession and organize an orderly transfer of power to a designated heir(s). The disaffected Hunnic princes and nobles who had kept quiet during Attila’s reign now all started to clamour for attention and the principal power brokers sought to resolve the question by force of arms. Thus an unprecedented internal military conflict arose and this had fatal consequences for the unity of the Hun Empire. Traditional historiography had presented this civil war within the Hunnic Empire as a war of liberation fought by Germanic peoples led by King Ardaric of the Gepids to free themselves from the Turkic Huns led by Attila’s chosen heir Ellac. This is hardly an accurate description of the war however. The identity of all the principal actors in the great political drama that unfolded during the postAttila Hunnic civil wars bears witness to a strife over fief distribution among Hunnic princes, not a revolt among Germanic subjects against their Hunnic rulers. The confusion about the nature of the conflicts following Attila’s death was due to the erroneous assumption that the key figures with Germanic sounding names mentioned in the Getica of Jordanes, our principal source on these events, were native leaders of Germanic ethnic origin. These men were in fact, as will be shown below, Hunnic rulers of largely mixed origin. The wars they waged against each other at the head of various Turkic and Germanic tribal confederations were thus civil wars within the Hunnic system that lead to the dissolution of that imperial order. In 454 AD at Nedao Ardaric, king of the Gepids defeated and killed Ellac, the eldest son of Attila and ruler of the Akatziri. But who exactly was this Ardaric and what exactly were the ‘Gepids’ who defeated Ellac? Contrary to the common belief that the Gepids were a ‘Germanic’ people rebelling against the Huns, archaeology from the area occupied by the Gepids actually shows that the ruling elite of the Gepids were a heterogeneous group displaying some Mongoloid features all throughout the fifth and sixth centuries AD. This was no doubt the result of inter-marriages with the Huns and the presence of actual Huns within the Gepid aristocracy and ruling family. The Gepid elite was culturally and physically the most similar to the Huns from Asia of all the Germanic peoples. Noticeably the practice of Hunnic cranial deformation was extremely common
among the Gepids.2 Ardaric the king of these Gepids was able to defeat Ellac because he managed to gain the support of not just his Gepids, but some of the Suebi, Rugii and
Sarmatians as well.3 Virtually all the tribes in the west seem to have sided with
Ardaric against those of the east.4 But why does Ardaric feature so prominently in
what Jordanes tells us was a feud over fief distribution among Hunnic princes?5 The answer is because Ardaric was also most likely a Hunnic prince. The Huns in the traditional Inner Asian manner distributed conquered peoples as fiefs to members of their royal family and senior nobles. The Gepids were a particularly significant fief since they probably formed the core of Attila’s revolt against his brother Bleda and this explains Ardaric’s privileged position within Attila’s



retinue and his principal role in the civil war following Attila’s death. We have already encountered a blood relative of Attila called Laudaricus in our
discussion of the battle of Chalons.6 His name is the entirely Germanic Laudareiks
(Lauda king)7 and this tells us that having a Germanic sounding name is not an indication of one’s ‘Germanic’ ethnicity within the Hunnic Empire. Laudareiks was a Hun just like Attila, despite his Germanic name or more probably the Germanicized version of his originally Hunnic name. The Gothic practice of Germanicizing Hunnic names is well known. For instance the Gothic suffix -ila was added to the name of the Hunnic king Roas/Ruga (which became
Roila/Rugila).8 The Turkic names of virtually all the princes who rule Hunnic fiefs in the east such as Attila’s sons Ellac, Ernakh/Irnik and Dengizich, Attila’s kinsmen who reside in the Danubian region after Attila: Emnetzur and Ultzindur
(who hold Oescus, Utum and Almus on the right bank of the Danube),9 also of Attila’s uncle and father Octar and Mundzuk, and Hunnic royal family members Kursich and Basich, are proof that the original names of the Hunnic princes were Turkic, right up to the time of Attila’s death and beyond, not Germanic. The Germanicization of Hunnic (Oghuric Turkic) names may have been a conscious policy among the Hunnic elite in the west to ease the transition to their rule of formerly independent Germanic tribal unions. The changes in the rendition of the
name of the third of Attila’s sons, Dengizich (meaning in Turkic Lake,10 with the implied meaning of broad, great) provides us with a good example. Although we know clearly that his name while in the east was the Turkic Dengizich, when he became active in the west his name was pronounced by his Germanic subjects as
Dintzic11/Denitsik, reflecting the frequent practice of dropping the g in Germanic transliterations of Hunnic names, and was finally changed to the Germanicized
Dintzirichus (i.e. Dintzik the rei/c/king).12 The name Ardaric is similarly also most probably a Germanicized version of a
former Hunnic name (Iranian in origin).13 There are numerous Sarmatian names that are attested which closely resemble that of Ardaric, e.g. Ardagdakos, Ardarakos, Ardariskos, Ardaros, etc. The first element of the name Ardaric ard is etymologically related to the Ossetian (the only surviving language that derives
directly from ancient Alan and possibly Sarmatian)14 term ard, meaning oath. To this was added the Germanic suffix reik, through the usual practice of
Germanicizing Hunnic/Alanic names.15 His name would thus mean a king bound by an oath (oath king), which instantly reminds us of Jordanes’ repeated assertion that Ardaric shared in Attila’s plans and was famous due to his great loyalty to
the Hun king.16 What could be a greater assurance of loyalty than an oath of loyalty? The term ard also had connotations of the divine in the Alan language (as
in the case of the name Ardabourios) and was associated with the sacred.17 Thus it is a term designating the sacred nature of an oath of loyalty to one’s sovereign. The hybrid nature of Ardaric’s name and also those of other Hun nobles in the west also draws from the common Central Asian use of hybrid names that combined elements from different languages as a means of political and social
expediency.18 The name Ardaric was therefore an expedient name, not necessarily



even a personal name, but a court title (meaning loyal king, bound by an oath of loyalty to Attila). That he possesses a hybrid name rather than a straightforward Gothic or some other East Germanic name is indicative of the fact that he was not a native Germanic ruler, but a Hun ruler imposed on the Gepids by the conquering Huns. That Ardaric was a member of the high Hunnic aristocracy is further evidenced by the fact that one of Ardaric’s grandsons Mundo, the nephew of the Gepid king Trapstila (or Thraustila), was called both a Gepid and a Hun and was in fact a
descendant of both Attila and Ardaric.19 Pohl points out that Mundo was the son
of a son of Attila who married a daughter of Ardaric.20 This implies that Ardaric had royal Hunnic connections either by marriage or by birth. The Icelandic Hervararsaga which many historians agree preserves some faint historical memory of fifth century events provides us with more information on who Ardaric actually was and why he engaged in war against the ‘Huns’. The saga tells us that Heithrek king of the Goths had two sons, Angantyr (whose mother is not mentioned) and Hloth from his marriage to a Hunnic princess, the daughter of Humli, king of the Huns. Heithrek has been identified by some historians with
none other than Ardaric,21 but from what happens next in the saga it is more likely that it is his son Angantyr who is Ardaric. The saga relates that Hloth the son of the Hunnic wife who had grown up at the court of his Hunnic maternal grandfather demanded an equal share of the Goths after the death of Heithrek, his father. When Angantyr refused to accept the demand the Huns attacked to enforce the rights of Hloth by force, but were vanquished. Both Hloth and Humli,
the Hun king, were killed in the engagement with the Goths.22 The Hunnic civil war was initially started by disputes over inheritance of ‘fiefs’ among Attila’s heirs and the information provided by this saga seems to capture the gist of what actually happened. Ellac (presumably Humli of the saga), the new king of the Huns, when he ascended the throne or attempted to seize the throne after the death of his father would have tried to impose his authority over his father’s entire domain by redistributing fiefs to his own supporters. Ardaric, like Angantyr in the saga, either stood to lose from the new settlement imposed by Ellac (i.e. ceding part of his people and territory to Hloth) and consequently revolted or possibly even supported another claimant to the Hunnic throne, perhaps his own son-in-law. This son of Attila (and son-in-law of Ardaric) may have functioned as a king in his own right in the Gepid kingdom which emerged
after the end of the civil wars23 and his presence could provide an explanation for the dual kingship found among the Gepids, which incidentally of course was a conscious imitation of Hunnic political practices. Ardaric was thus not a Germanic ‘freedom fighter’ against the ‘tyrannical’ rule of the Huns, but actually as a respected member of the Hunnic royal family, a key player in the succession struggle that followed Attila’s death. The fact that the state he established after the battle rapidly became Gepid, not Hunnic despite its Hunnic ruling elite is hardly surprising as the western half of the Hun Empire was almost entirely Germanic in ethnic composition. However, it is clear that Ardaric continued to use the trappings of Hunnic imperial rule to solidify his control in the Carpathian basin. As noted briefly above, the Gepid political system was identical to the political structure found



among the Huns, whereby there is a supreme king in the eastern core territory in the Tisza region, who was supported by a sub-ordinate western king in Sirmium in the now familiar dual system. Under the two Gepid kings there were the dukes (i.e. sub-kings, who each had their own military retinue) such as Omharus of Transylvannia. There was also a council of nobles, again in the same manner as among the Huns and other Inner Asian polities, which limited the power of the king. Interestingly, among the Suebi who were geographically close to the Gepids and who were active in the post-Nedao competition for land in the Danubian region, we also find the residue of Hunnic political influence. They, like the more powerful Gepids to the east, had two kings Hunimund and Alarie (Getica 54.277).
POST-ATTILA KINGS OF EUROPE
Not only Ardaric, but every other major figure to emerge out of the Hunnic civil war was also like Ardaric of Hunnic provenance or a high-ranking official in the Hunnic imperial court. Edeco, king of the Sciri, was obviously, as Priscus tells us,
a Hun.24 After establishing a short-lived Scirian state the tribes he governed would later be responsible for the death of Valamer, the founding king of the
Ostrogoths.25 Edeco’s son Odoacer, whose ancestry was likewise Hunnic founded the first ‘barbarian’ kingdom in Italy and delivered the coup-de-gräce on what



remained of the Western Roman Empire. The Hunnic identity of the famous Odoacer and his father Edeco is elaborated in detail in the author’s previous book on the Huns: The Huns, Rome and the Birth
of Europe (Kim, 2013). In this book, because of the lack of space it is not possible to cite every evidence and argument in favour of this identification. However, to list the most pertinent evidence, the tribe with which he is affiliated most closely is the clearly Turkic (i.e. Hunnic) tribe of the Torcilingi (Getica 46.242.). Both Jordanes on multiple occasions and likewise the Lombard historian Paul the
Deacon26 make this identification clear and Jordanes by mentioning also in his narrative the Thuringians (Thuringos/Thoringos (Getica 55.280)), disqualifies any erroneous conjecture that he had confused the Torcilingi with the Germanic Thuringi. Jordanes mentions the Torcilingi three times in relation to Odoacer’s conquest
of Italy27 and the tribal name is quite visibly etymologically linked to names of earlier eastern tribes such as the Turcae (first century AD tribe in the Azov region,
southern Russia)28 and Tyrcae (a people in the same area).29 Then there is the
name Torci (also Turqui) given by Frankish historian Fredegar in the middle of the seventh century AD when refering to a clearly Hunnic people in the Danubian
region.30 It is obvious that the name Torci and the Torcilingi are identical: Torc+ connecting vowel i + Germanic suffix -ling. The etymological links between the name Torc/Torci and the name Turk are also undeniable. The name Turk was
frequently rendered Tore or Tork, as in Tork31 (designating a Western Oghuz Turkic tribe that fought for the Kievan Rus as part of the so-called Chernii
Kloboutsi confederation),32 as late as the twelfth century AD. Odoacer is furthermore identified with another group with possible Hunnic
origins, the Rogi. Jordanes calls Odoacer ‘by race a Rogian’, genere Rogus33 and
refers to the tyranny of the king (i.e. Odoacer) of the Torcilingi and Rogi, sub
Regis Torcilingorum Rogorumque tyrannide.34 These Rogians have been identified by most scholars with the Germanic Rugi on the Baltic Sea region. However, this identification derives from the preconception that Odoacer was a Germanic king and therefore the groups associated with him must be Germanic. Rather it is more likely that genere Rogus refers to Odoacer’s affiliation with the clan/tribe of Ruga/Roga, the Hunnic king and uncle of Attila the Hun. We know for instance that the Hunnic Ultzinzures, a group that lived along the Danube around 454 AD,
was named after Ultzindur the relative of Attila.35 The Rogi were probably also a group named after Roga/Ruga the great Hunnic king who was the first of the Hun kings to rule over all of Germania. An association with Ruga therefore carried some prestige in wider Germania, hence the adoption of this name by this probably mixed group of Huns and Germanic tribesmen.
The name of Odoacer’s father Edeco/Edico36 or Edica has no Germanic etymology and it is clearly a non-Germanic name. It does, however, have excellent Turco-Mongol etymologies. For instance, the name is probably linked to
the old Turkish name ädgü37 (meaning ‘good’) and the Mongolic Edgü.38



Odoacer’s own name may be etymologically linked to the name of the Hunnic
prince Octar, the brother of Ruga and Mundzuk, and the Turkic name Ot-toghar.39
The name of his son Oklan is without a doubt the Turkic Oghlan (Tur. youth).40 The name of Odoacer’s brother is Hunoulphus (the Hun wolf). The association of virtually every individual and tribe closest to Odoacer with the Huns is a clear indication of his Hunnic origin. Both Edeco and his son Odoacer, however, were like all other Huns, probably highly mixed (racially and ethnically) and possessed a heterogeneous identity. Odoacer was probably mostly Scirian in terms of blood lineage on his mother’s side and mainly a Turkic Hun on his father’s side. The third important figure to emerge from the Hunnic civil war was Valamer, the king of the Ostrogoths. He too was a Hunnic prince/noble like Ardaric and Edeco mentioned above. Again a full discussion of Valamer’s Hunnic origins cannot be included here and I must refer the reader to my previous book on the Huns. However, Valamer’s career is intimately intertwined with the history of the post-Attila Huns, with Attila’s son Dengizich in particular. Therefore, a brief overview of his Hunnic origin and conflict with Dengizich will be provided here. Jordanes presents Valamer as the legitimate heir of the old East Gothic ruling house, the Amal dynasty. Closer examination of the available evidence suggests otherwise. Valamer’s dynasty was in reality a new dynasty imposed on the Goths, not the continuation of the house of King Ermanaric which had ruled the Goths
before the Hunnic conquest.41 As Heather rightfully points out, the Hunnic conquest had profound implications for the former political order of the Goths
before conquest.42 Ermanaric’s name was at some point inserted into Valamer’s genealogy in order to make him and his dynasty look more genuinely Gothic. The 80 years of Hunnic domination, which without a doubt had a significant impact
on the Ostrogothic royal line, was thus downplayed.43 When one examines the Amal genealogy in the Getica (14.17) however, it quickly becomes apparent that many of these kings are in reality not Gothic kings at all, but Hunnic rulers. The name of the second king Hulmul is probably linked etymologically to the name Humli, king of the Huns, which we have seen in the
Icelandic saga about the conflict between Ardaric and Ellac.44 The fourth king Amal and the sixth Ostrogotha are obviously eponymous figures invented as ancestors of the Amal clan and Ostrogoths respectively. The fifth ruler Hisarnis,
‘the iron one’, is mythical like the first king Gapt.45 However, the well-known cult of iron and blacksmithing in Inner Asian steppe cultures (e.g. the name Temujin (Genghis/Chinggis Khan) meaning ‘man of iron’) suggests that this name too may have a steppe Hunnic origin or has been influenced by steppe traditions. The Ostrogothic royal genealogy is simply full of Hunnic figures and figures possibly co-opted from Hunnic tradition. The Hunnic origin of this dynasty is made even more apparent by the name of
the first clearly non-divine ancestor of the Amals in their genealogy,46 Hunuil. Hunuil is most likely a Turkic term combining the imperial name Hun with il meaning people or state in Turkish, as in Türkmen ili (the Turkmen people) and Ozbek ili (Uzbek people). Such a term would not make any sense as a personal name, but as we can see in the cases of Ostrogotha and Amal, these names are not personal names but eponymous attributions based on names of peoples and clans.

somewhat perplexingly appears as the name of the ancestor Gothic king who
supposedly led the Goths out of Scandinavia, Berig.55 Christensen reasonably
identifies the name Berig as either a borrowing from Hunnic or perhaps Celtic.56 The name and the associated legend is unlikely to be Celtic, given the vast time gap between Cassius Dio, the source which mentions a similar Celtic name in Britain, and the time of Jordanes, but Priscus was without a doubt a source that Jordanes directly used. It is highly probable that like many of the other Amal ‘Gothic’ ancestors, Berig too was originally a Hunnic ancestor figure, who led not the Gothic migration from the north, but the Hunnic migration to the west from Inner Asia. All this reveals that what we have in the Amal geneaology is the dynastic tradition of the Hunnic royal family superimposed on the vague memory of the Goths migrating from somewhere in the north. Also, according to Jordanes, the first known king of the Huns in Europe was a certain Balamber, the ‘King of the Huns’ during the late fourth century AD. It has been suspected that this Balamber was actually the same person as the Ostrogoth Valamer in the mid fifth century AD, whose name in Greek was written ßaAocpqp
(Balamer).57 Interestingly in Jordanes the Hunnic Balamber kills Vinitharius, allegedly an Amal Goth and grandfather of Valamer, with the help of another Gothic princeling called Gesimund, son of Hunimund. Balamber then takes as his wife Vadamerca, the dead man’s grand-daughter. Given the fact that Vinitharius’ name means Wend fighter (i.e. Slav fighter, Slavs who only emerge in our sources from the late fifth century AD onwards) he is clearly not a fourth century enemy of the Hunnic Balamber-Valamer, but a mid fifth century figure at the time when the ‘Gothic’ Balamber-Valamer was active. This is confirmed yet again by the fact that Vinitharius is reputed to have campaigned against the fifth century Slavic Antes who only started to move into the southern Ukraine and Moldavia from
somewhere in the north long after the Hunnic conquest.58 It therefore becomes clear that the events relating to Gesimund, Balamber and Vinitharius are fifth century events that have been artificially pushed back into the fourth century to make a single individual the Hunnic-Gothic king Valamer, a separate Hunnic Balamber (fourth century) and Gothic Valamer (fifth century). Vinitharius who was killed by Balamber (Valamer) was entered into the Amal genealogy as the father of Vandalarius, the father of Valamer (Balamber) (Getica, 14.79). The fact that Balamber/Valamer married Vinitharius’ grand-daughter after defeating him must have contributed to this bizarre phenomenon of Vinitharius the victim being transformed into the grandfather of his killer. In fact the game is given away by a statement in a later passage (Getica 48.252) where Jordanes leaves out both Vinitharius and Vinitharius’ father Valaravrans from the ‘Amal’ ancestry and calls Vandalarius the son of a brother of Ermanaric, that is Vultuulf. This shows that Vinitharius and his father have been inserted into the Amal genealogy to make the Hunnic ‘Amals’, Gothic Amals. Now who then are Vultuulf and Vandalarius, the grandfather and father of Valamer the Ostrogothic king? We have already noted earlier the Gothic practice of Germanizing or Gothifying Hunnic royal names by adding Germanic suffixes. Thus the Germanic suffix -ila was added to names like Attila and Rugila (Ruga), and Dengizich becomes Dintzirich by adding the Germanic suffix -reik (king). In addition even the names themselves were on occasions substituted by similar



sounding Gothic names. By way of example the name of Attila’s father
Mundzuk/Muncuq (pearl/jewel (tur.)) was turned into Mundiuks59 with the dz
sound altered to make the name sound more Gothic, like the mund element in Gothic names such as Munderich. Attila’s own name was also altered from Tur.
As-til-a (great river/sea)60 to a more Gothic sounding atta-ila (little father) in the same way. The name of Vultuulf, the grandfather of Valamer, was probably subjected to the same process. The name is a combination of two elements Vult and the suffix -ulf, as in Hun-oulphus (-ulf, the Germanic word for wolf). Now the Vult component appears in Gothic names such as Sigis-vultus (Ostrogothic, fifth
century).61 Vultus (Gothic wulpus) means grandeur/fame. So Vultuulf would be
wulp(u)-wulfs, Tamous/glorious w olf. However, we also know from our sources
that the Vu- in Vult was often rendered Uld as in Gib-uldus and Uldida.62 We need not search long to realise that there is a plethora of Hunnic names with the element Uld/Ult in our sources for the fifth and sixth centuries: Uld-in, Ult-zin-cur
(Ernak’s cousin), Ult-zia-giri (Hunnic tribal name),63 Ould-ak (Hunnic general in the East Roman army in 550 AD), etc. The name Vultuulf therefore, despite its Gothic appearance, is in all likelihood, especially given the Hunnic identity of Valamer, Vultuulf s grandson, a Hunnic name that has been gothified (Hunnic name Uld/t+Germanic suffix ulf, then assimilated into the more familiar Gothic word wulpus to form Vultuulf). What is fascinating is the fact that in the early fifth century when Vultuulf must have been active we find the Hunnic sub-king Uld-in (in in his name being a Greek suffix added to his name), who died ca. 410
AD. Equally fascinating is the fact that Germanic names with the element wulpus
as prefix seem to appear mostly after the career of Uldin, just as the element iok
(probably deriving from the ju k or dzuk element in Hunnic names such as
Mundzuk)64 as suffix in Germanic names such as Gundiok appear after the career of the Hunnic prince Mundzuk, the father of Attila. Valamer is thus likely to be a descendant of King Uldin. This becomes most probable when we consider the name of his supposed son Vandalarius which means ‘he who conquered the Vandals’. The Vandals fled from their Central European homeland with the Alans and the Suebi in 405 AD to avoid Hunnic conquest. There is no Ostrogothic king who could have fought the Vandals after the Hunnic conquest of 376 and there is simply no other record anywhere of any conflict between the Ostrogoths and the Vandals around the time that Vandalarius would have been active (early fifth centuries AD). Who could possibly have conquered or beaten the Vandals in the early fifth century? Obviously Uldin who drove them away. Uldin is surely Vultuulf and Vandalarius is presumably his son who participated in the battle against the Vandals ca. 405 AD.
Thus, instead of the anomaly of the Goths being ruled by their own native rulers for all of the 80 years they were under Hunnic domination, we can see that the Ostrogoths were headed by a Hunnic ruler from a Hunnic noble house. Valamer and his brothers Thiudimer and Vidimer were Hunnic fief-holders
descended from Uldin.65 The later division of the Ostrogoths between Valamer



and his brothers, while recognizing the supremacy of Valamer as high king, is also clearly a continuation of the Hunnic, Inner Asian practice of ‘fie f distribution
among members of the royal family.66 Furthermore, since Valamer and his brothers are Hunnic princes, his cousins, Hunimund the Great, king of the Goths and Suebi, and Hunimund’ sons Thorismud and Gesimund in Jordanes’ narrative are likewise also Huns and not Goths in origin. None of these individuals therefore have anything to do with Ermanaric and the old ruling family of the Goths other than perhaps via inter marriage (e.g. the marriage of Valamer to Vinitharius’ grand-daughter). Revealingly in a document dated to early 533 AD Cassiodorus, who probably provided Jordanes with some of the genealogy which we find in the Getica, does not include either Ermanaric or the Germanic demi-gods of Jordanes in his Amal
genealogy.67 Since Vandalarius, the father of Valamer, and his brothers did not become a king in his own right after the death of Vultuulf/Uldin, it is possible to assume that Uldin’s position as sub-king over the fief consisting mainly of Goths was assumed by Hunimund the Great, a cousin or perhaps nephew of the deceased Uldin, who also controlled the additional fief consisting of the recently conquered Suebi in the west. That Hunimund the Great was a vassal Hunnic king is indicated
in his very name, which means literally ‘under the suzerainty of the Hun’.68 One of his descendants Hunimund king of the Suebi, who quarrels with Valamer and his brothers, presumably over the division of his ancestral fief, also carries the same name. According to Jordanes Gesimund, the son of Hunimund the Great,
was faithful to his oath of loyalty to the Huns.69 These men were all subordinate sub-kings and fief-holders of the Hunnic Empire, just like the Hun noble Edeco of the Sciri and Ardaric of the Gepids. The sub-kingship, which was hereditary in this family, passed from Uldin to a cousin or nephew, as in the case of the succession of the nephews Bleda and Attila to Ruga’s position, a common feature of Hunnic and Central Asian steppe laws of succession. This understanding makes the record in Cassiodorus (Variae 8.9.8, addressed to a certain Tuluin) about the hero Gensemund comprehensible. Many have wondered why this figure is considered by some of the Goths as eligible for kingship. This Gensemund ends up deferring to Valamer and is subsequently adopted as a son-at-arms (i.e. vassal) by the new Gothic king. Gensemund is none other than Gesimund, the son of Hunimund, the ally of Balamber who helped Balamber kill Vinitharius, another indication that the Hunnic Balamber is the same person as the Gothic Valamer. Gensemund/Gesimund was considered worthy of kingship precisely because he represented the senior line of the Hunnic dynasty to which both he and Valamer belonged. Valamer was therefore a member of the cadet branch of the Hunnic royal dynasty that ruled the Goths and also the Suebi. Jordanes when discussing the ethnogenesis of the Huns tells of how Gothic
witches copulated with evil spirits and gave birth to the Huns.70 This story implies that the Goths regarded the Huns and themselves or their royal family at least, which as this story indicates must have claimed a sacred or ‘devilish’ origin in ways reminiscent of the concept of sacred kingship among steppe royal clans, to
be blood related.71 Stories of women conceiving from the attentions of a spirit (in

It was only after this initial clash with Constantinople that Valamer’s stance towards the Romans changed and he agreed to send his son or nephew Theodoric to Constantinople as a hostage. A more definite foedus involving a payment of 300 pounds of gold per year from the Romans to the Goths was agreed to in 461 AD.

Dengizich’s enterprise ended in catastrophic failure and his severed head was brought back to Constantinople in 469 AD, quite fittingly perhaps by the RomanoGothic general Anagast, the son of Arnegisclus who died at the hands of Attila, Dengizich’s father, in 447 AD. The disaster was precipitated by several factors. Firstly Dengizich’s forces were seriously depleted due to the opposition of his brother Ernakh, his overlord, who opposed the war against the Romans because

the south around this time, possibly due to resistance encountered in the west from the Huns under Ernakh, which halted their expansion in the west. Thus, during the invasion of 467-8 AD Dengizich was forced to depend inordinately on recently reconquered Ostrogoths and equally unreliable tribe of the Bittugurs. The unreliability of his troops and the lack of support from Ernakh would prove devastating for Dengizich. The Romans, according to Priscus, somehow managed to corner a group of Goths in Dengizich’s army in a ‘hollow place’ and then foster rebellion among them by sending a Hun by the name of Chelchal, who was in
Roman service, to incite them.91 The revolt of the Goths instigated by this subterfuge, apparently spread and forced Dengizich to withdraw. Shortly after this fiasco he was killed in mysterious circumstances, presumably murdered, and his head was delivered to the Romans. Dengizich’s defeat and his sudden death in 469 AD also allowed the brothers of Valamer to finally break away from the Attilid Huns. It is likely that the Amals probably played a major role in Dengizich’s defeat and death by leading the Gothic revolt against him during the campaign against the Romans. This explains why Theodoric, Thiudimer’s son (or perhaps Valamer’s son), was released and sent back to the Ostrogoths shortly after this event by Constantinople ca. 469
AD.92 The alignment of the Bittugurs (one of Dengizich’s subject tribes) with the Amal Goths after Dengizich’s demise also strengthens the conjecture that it was the revolt of the Amals that caused the ultimate failure of Dengizich’s expedition, reminiscent of Uldin’s doomed expedition earlier in the century which also was
sabotaged by Roman subterfuge and revolt among levied troops.93 The Bittugurs must have collaborated with the Ostrogoths in bringing about the demise of King Dengizich. The fall of Dengizich after the 467-8 war against the Romans meant that the Ostrogoths were finally free to take independent action against their other enemies in the Danubian region. According to Jordanes, just before Theodoric returned to the Goths from Constantinople ca. 469 AD in late 468 AD the Ostrogoths launched a daring campaign against the Suebi and their federates the
Alamanni, presumably somewhere in Noricum.94 We also hear of the Goths in Lower Pannonia (i.e. those of Thiudimer) being hostile to the Rugi of King Flaccitheus in Noricum and plotting to kill the Rugian king in an ambush (Vita S.
Sev 5). This Gothic belligerence however incited the other tribes in the region to unite against them. A grand alliance of Sciri, Rugi, Suebi and the Gepids seems to have taken the field against the Ostrogoths. The great battle at the river Bolia, which Jordanes places some time around 465 AD immediately after the death of
Valamer,95 but which almost certainly took place around 470 AD, again ended in defeat for the Ostrogoths. Vidimer, the youngest of the three Valamer brothers, moved his group of Goths first into western Noricum and then into Italy, while Thiudimer fled south into Macedonia. Ostrogothic lands in the Danubian region were shared out among the victors (eastern Noricum to the Rugi, Pannonia to the Gepids, Sciri and Suebi). A further squabble then seems to have arisen among the victorious tribes over the spoils and this triggered some of them to migrate west. Hunimund, the presumably Hunnic ruler of the Suebi led his tribe into the territory of the Alamanni. Hunimund during his journey into southern Germany attacked the city

Gaul from Pannonia because of a conflict with the Huns.96 Sidonius talks about how the Ostrogoths, with the support of the Visigothic king Euric (reigned from 466 AD onwards), triumphed over the ‘neighbouring (vicinosque)’ Huns. These Huns who fought the Ostrogoths and Visigoths close to Gaul, presumably in Italy during the early 470s AD, cannot be any other group than the Torcilingi Huns of Odoacer accompanied by the Sciri, Rugi/Rogi and Heruls. Sidonius calls them the hordes of Scythia and adds that the ‘Roman’ (i.e. the Western Roman emperor) ca. 476 AD sought salvation from Euric against these hordes of the Scythian clime. The ‘Scythians’ who are mentioned here are of course the army of Odoacer that

7 THE HUNS OF THE PONTIC STEPPES:
THE UTIGUR-KUTRIGUR ‘BULGAR’
HUNS
THE OGHURS
Between the death of Attila the Hun in 453 AD and the re-emergence of political unity in the eastern half of the Hunnic Empire in the late 460s-early 470s AD, over a period of some 20 years the empire of the Huns was shaken by upheavals, caused mainly by the arrival of new Inner Asian peoples in Europe. These new arrivals were mostly called ‘Oghurs’ (meaning ‘tribe’ in Oghuric Turkic). In previous chapters we have already mentioned the conflict between the Rouran Khaganate and Hunnic remnants (such as the Yueban (the weak) Xiongnu) in Central Asia. Around 434 AD the Rouran Khaganate, based in Mongolia, possibly together with the ‘Var’ people under the Hephthalites, initiated their great push westwards. This pressure in some way seems to have contributed to the replacement of the old Kidarite Hunnic dynasty in the White Hun Empire
(southern C entral A sia) w ith the n ew H ephthalite d yn asty.1 In n orth ern C en tral A sia (m odern K azakhstan) the Y ueban (w eak X ion gn u )
H uns cam e u nd er intense p ressure from the R ouran, as did elem ents o f the
recen tly form ed Tiele T urkic federation o f tribes, the so-called O ghurs, som e o f

b y the R ouran (possibly A vars) and in tu rn applied pressure on the various
O ghurs. Priscus tells us th at the defeated O ghur groups fought th eir w a y into the

w estern O ghurs)4 overw helm ed the A katziri H uns form erly ruled b y Ellac, the son
o f A ttila w h o h a d fa lle n a t N e d a o in 454 AD.
The assault by the Saragurs and other Oghurs on the Akatziri Huns must have been a long drawn out process and probably began some time in the 450s AD. Therefore, just after the battle of Nedao, the eastern faction in the Hunnic civil war was prevented from taking the offensive again against Ardaric’s western faction because they became engaged in an existential struggle against more powerful invaders from the east. The inability of the militarily more formidable Huns in the Pontic steppe region to crush the secessionist movement among the militarily inferior western tribes in the decades following Nedao becomes



intelligible w h en one considers these geopolitical developm ents th at th reaten ed
the eastern flank o f these T urkic H uns.
T he task o f salvaging w h at w as left o f the eastern h a lf o f the H u n nic E m p ire fell
on E rnakh, the you ngest o f A ttila’s sons. Priscus records th at Ern akh received
p referential treatm en t from A ttila because supposedly there w as a p rop hecy to the
effect th at A ttila’s race w ould fall after A ttila’s death, but w ould be restored by
E rn ak h .5 This story in Priscus m ay actu ally have been coloured b y hindsight,
since Priscus w as aw are o f E rn ak h ’s successes in the decades follow ing N edao.
E rn ak h ap p aren tly b ecam e th e fou n ding ru ler o f the so-called ‘B u lg ar’ H uns (th at

H uns) in C en tral A sia th at had fragm en ted under R ouran pressure.
The new Oghur arrivals, however, made a lasting impact on the nature of the Hunnic state that emerged in the late fifth century AD. As Golden astutely points out, the names of the two wings of this reconfigured Hunnic state: Kutrigur (9 Oghurs) Huns in the west and the Utigur (30 Oghurs) Huns in the east, both

H enceforth th ey w ere know n collectively as B ulgar H uns. The term s U tigur,



Kutrigur and Onogur were not ethnic designations, but terms signifying the socio military organization of steppe peoples, 30, 9 and 10 oghurs (tribes/units). That the name Hun used alongside the names Utigur, Kutrigur, Bulgar and Onogur in our sixth century AD sources is not simply an anachronism or a generic term for nomad is shown by the fact that Procopius, Agathias and Menander all call the Utigurs and Kutrigurs Huns, but hardly ever in a generic sense. The name Hun is almost always used to designate a distinct grouping of tribes. For instance, the Eastern Roman emperor Justin, when replying to the Avar ambassador Targites, is reported to have declared that he would not pay the tribute Justinian had earlier paid to the Huns, now to the Avars. The Kutrigurs and Utigurs are
then mentioned by name.10 This clearly indicates firstly that the Utigurs and Kutrigurs were Huns and secondly that both the Avars and the Romans regarded the contemporary Kutrigurs and Utigurs to be Huns not in an anachronistic sense, but in reality. That the Avars and Huns, both steppe peoples, are mentioned as distinct groups also shows that Menander is here not using the name Hun in a generic sense for nomad (that would only really begin with Theophylact Simocatta in the seventh century who calls both the Avars and the Turks Huns). A letter from the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian to the Utigur Hunnic king Sandilkh shows that the Romans expected the eastern Hunnic king, in the traditional steppe manner that assigned supreme power to the eastern wing of the political entity, to have the ability to restrain the western wing under King
Zabergan of the Kutrigurs. Thus gifts to the Huns were sent only to the Utigurs,11 which ended up offending the Kutrigurs. In the letter Justinian incites the Utigurs to punish the Kutrigurs for invading Roman territory without the authorization of their Utigur overlords. He insinuates that the Kutrigurs had attacked the Romans to demonstrate that they were superior to the Utigurs. This apparently angered Sandilkh, who having learned of the Kutrigur expedition against the Romans
wished, according to Agathias, to punish the Kutrigurs for their insolence.12 Roman subterfuge thus brought on a civil war among the Huns in the middle of the sixth century A D , ending the political stability and unity achieved by Ernakh’s wars of unification in the second half of the preceding fifth century AD. Thus the eastern half of the Hunnic Empire was still alive and well nearly 100 years after the death of Attila, firmly contradicting thereby the erroneous assumption that the Hunnic Empire simply disintegrated without leaving a trace and the Huns just vanished thereafter. The Huns of the east, as mentioned above,
acquired a new name, Bulgar (which in Turkic means ‘stir, confuse or mix’),13 which probably refers to the process of tribal union and the mixing of the new
Oghurs (tribes) and the original Huns under the Attilids.14 Once the unification was complete, the Huns again emerged to threaten the Romans.
THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE BULGAR HUNS, THE CAUCASIAN HUNS AND THE AVARS
The new Bulgar Huns begin to appear in historical records in the late fifth century AD when the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno appeals to them for aid against the Ostrogoths in 4 8 0 AD . Sensing Eastern Roman weakness the Huns would raid the Balkan territories of the Eastern Roman Empire repeatedly in 4 9 1 , 4 9 3 , 4 9 9 , 5 0 2



AD . The Bulgar Hunnic raid in 4 9 9 AD inflicted a particularly embarrassing defeat on the Romans who lost more than 4 ,0 0 0 men and four military counts. Six years later in 5 0 5 AD the Bulgar Huns are however seen in alliance with the Romans against the Ostrogoths and their ally Mundo, the Gepid grandson of Attila the
Hun.15 The Huns had not disappeared at all, but continued to be a major political actor in eastern and southeastern Europe. In 5 1 4 AD the Roman usurper Vitalian, who is called a Scythian by our sources
(so he was possibly a Hun, Alan or an eastern Goth in origin),16 appealed to the
Bulgar Huns for aid against the legitimate emperor Anastasius.17 In the following year in 5 1 5 AD on the other side of the Black Sea the Caucasian Huns (a group independent of the Attilid Bulgar Huns in the Ukraine and southern Russia) raided Armenia, Cappadocia and Lycaonia. The power of the Huns had hardly receded. The threat from them was so great that the emperor Justinian in 5 3 1 AD had to specifically appoint a certain Chilbudius as general of Thrace to guard the river Danube against repeated incursion by the Huns, who, according to Procopius, along with new tribal groups such as the Antes and Sclaveni (early Slavs), had
‘done irreparable harm to the Romans’.18 These precautions would have little effect however. The Romans faced an invasion of Kutrigur Huns in Moesia and Illyricum in 538/9 AD and by 540 AD Hunnic armies were seen near Constantinople and also Thessaly (central Greece). Procopius records that the Huns had invaded the empire frequently before this, but never had the calamity for the Romans been so great. In 539 AD the Huns
captured 3 2 fortresses in Illyricum alone, allegedly taking 1 2 0 ,0 0 0 captives.19 Two decades later Zabergan and his Kutrigur Bulgar Huns in 5 5 8 AD would actually threaten the very existence of the Roman Empire by a devastating invasion of the Balkans, which brought Hunnic arms all the way to the long Walls of
Constantinople.20 In the western Balkans the Bulgar Huns would penetrate as far south as the Isthmus of Corinth. The activities of the Caucasian Huns in the sixth century AD also deserve mention at this point. These Huns were separated from the rest of the Huns due to the establishment of the Sabir realm ca. 506 AD in the Volga region. While co existing with both the Sabirs to the north and the Greater Hunnic state of the Attilids to the west in the Kuban steppe and southern Ukraine, these Caucasian
Huns would found a smaller kingdom in what is now modern Dagestan.21 Despite the small size of their state the military prowess of these Caucasian Huns was noted by both the Eastern Romans and the Sassanian Persians. In 5 0 3 AD the invasion of these Huns into northern Persia forced Kabad, the Sassanian king, to
prematurely end his successful campaign against the Romans.22 An East Roman ambassador, by the name of Probus, was then presumably sent to the Utigurs to win over with bribes an Attilid Hunnic army to aid Constantinople’s Caucasian allies struggling against the Persians. The Utigurs, however, refused to be bought and the East Romans instead hired some mercenaries from the Caucasian Huns who were sent to Lazica (western Georgia)
under a certain Peter to aid the Iberian king Gourgenes.23 Later in 5 2 2 AD Boareks,
the widow of King Balach, called a Hun by Malalas,24 but most likely a Sabir,25 attacked two Hunnic leaders in succession, King Styrax in 5 2 8 AD and then later



K ing G lones, on b eh alf o f the R om ans. T hese tw o kings attack ed b y B oareks w ere
ap p arently allies o f the Sassanians.
The Huns during this time also provided the Eastern Romans with some of their best soldiers. A Caucasian Hunnic sub-king called Askoum entered Roman service in 530 AD and was appointed magister militum per Illyricum. At the great battle of Daras, the Roman general Belisarius defeated the larger Sassanian Persian army mainly through the battle prowess of his 600 Massagetic (i.e. Hunnic) horsemen under the Huns Sunicas and Aigan. A further 600 horsemen under the Hunnic
c o m m a n d e r s S im m a s a n d A s c a n a ls o p e r f o r m e d b rillia n tly a g a in s t th e P e r s ia n s .26
These allied Hunnic mounted archers under the overall command of Aigan (by birth a Hun) and led by Sinnion and Balas, 600 in all, despite their small numbers would again play a decisive role in the Eastern Roman re-conquest of North
Africa from the Vandals.27 According to Procopius the Huns were reluctant to adhere to Roman military discipline, because they were allies of the Romans and
refused to be treated as subjects.28 The Vandals under King Gelimer sensing Hunnic discontent tried to win them over and Belisarius, the Roman commander, was forced to resort to gifts, banquets and ‘every other manner of flattering attention every day’ in order to prevent the Huns from going over to the Vandals. Such was their importance to victory or defeat of Roman arms. The Hunnic cavalry was so potent that Althias, a Hunnic commander in Roman service, would later defeat the army of laudas, king of the Moors, with a force of
just 70 Huns.29 The Roman army and especially the Roman cavalry in the sixth and seventh centuries AD actually copied wholesale the model of fifth century and contemporary Hunnic mobile armies, but nothing could equal the real Huns. Twohundred Hunnic allies would again participate in Belisarius’ conquest of Italy
from the Ostrogoths (530s A D ) and in the process earn a formidable reputation.30 Incidentally Mundo, the grandson of Attila, who had by this stage switched over to Roman service, would command the other wing of the Roman advance against
the Ostrogoths.31 The Huns would later form an important part of the great army with which the Roman general Narses defeated and killed the Ostrogothic king
T o til a .32
Victory or defeat in Rome’s wars in the east also similarly depended on the decision and mood of Hunnic mercenaries and allies. For instance in 531 AD the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian got hold of intelligence through a spy who had defected from the Persians that the Huns had decided to ally with the Persians and were marching into Roman territory to join up with the invading Persian host. This incredibly dangerous state of affairs however was turned to Rome’s advantage by a clever ruse. Justinian managed to trick the Persians then besieging Martyropolis into believing that these Huns had been won over by bribes from the Roman emperor. The Persians were terrified by the advance of these ‘hostile’
Huns and simply withdrew,33 demonstrating thereby the awe with which both the Romans and Persians held the military power of the Huns. The Caucasian Huns, despite the small size of their polity, would persist for centuries. Within the Khazar Khaganate (seventh-eleventh centuries A D ), which dominated the Pontic steppe after the demise of the Huns, there were seven hereditary kingdoms. One of these kingdoms was a Hunnic kingdom located in



the basin o f the Sulak river to the n orth o f the city o f D erbent, no doubt the
con tin u ation o f the old C au casian H unnic state.
R etu rn in g to the A ttilid H uns, the geograp h y o f the P on tic steppe region in the
m iddle o f the sixth cen tu ry gives us som e m ore tantalizing clues about the
a d m in is tra tio n o f th is A ttilid H u n n ic sta te . A c c o r d i n g to J o r d a n e s (Getica 5.36-37),
the steppes n orth o f the B lack Sea w as settled b y the follow ing groups: the
A k atziri (H uns situated som ew here n orth w est o f the B ulgars); the B ulgar (the
A ttilid ru le d K u trig u r an d U tig u r H u n s b e tw e e n th e D n ie p e r an d th e V o lg a );34 th e
H unni (as the n am e indicates tribes w ith H unnic origins) w h o w ere divided into
the so-called A ltziagiri n ear C h erson in the C rim ea and the Sabirs (in the V olga

c o n tr o lle d th e tr a d e in m a r t e n sk in s w i th th e U r a l r e g i o n ) .35
Another source, Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, gives us slightly more names, a total of 13 nomadic tribes around 555 AD: Onoghurs, Ogurs, Sabirs, Bulgars, Kutrigurs, Avars, Acatziri, Itimari, Saragurs, Barselts, Choliatae, Abdelae (Hephtalites) and
H ep h ta lite s.36 T h e H ep h talites, w h o se n a m e is d u p licated in th is list as b o th
Abdelae (‘bdl) and Hephtalites (ptlyt),37 as a result of some confusion, were at this time situated in Central Asia. The Avars and the Choliatae were new arrivals in the 550s AD . This leaves us with nine instead of five or six tribes given by Jordanes. However, pseudo-Zacharias was to an extent indulging in anachronisms. He appears to have simply named all the tribes that were historically known to the East Romans up to that point, rather than carefully show
th e c o n te m p o ra r y p o litica l situ a tio n in th e step p e z o n e .38 It is a lm o st c e rta in th a t

T hese altern ative n am es, an ach ron ism s and duplications in ou r lists have

This Attilid Hunnic state, as we have seen earlier, was cast into murderous civil war by the subterfuge of the Roman emperor Justinian in the middle of the sixth century AD. The disunity among the Bulgar Huns that resulted from this civil strife would prove decisive when the Avars appeared in the Pontic steppes. In 557
A D , a f t e r r e c e iv in g th e su b m is s io n o f th e S a b irs, O n o g u rs a n d B a r s il s 39 (th e
inhabitants o f the V olga region), the A v ar K haganate rapidly sw allow ed up the

E ssentially w h at had happened w as not the end o f the H unnic state, but a new
ro y al clan (A v ar) being superim posed on the old ro y al house o f A ttila (w hich n ow

Peloponnese (southern G reece). In 584 AD the E ast R om ans w ere forced to p ay a

Avars and their Bulgar Hun subjects went one step further and carried out what even the Huns of Attila had not attempted, laying siege to the great fortress of Constantinople itself in 6 2 6 AD . In this effort they were in alliance with the Sassanian Persians. The attack almost succeeded in destroying the Roman Empire for good. However, Rome’s final destruction would have to wait another 800 years when another Turkic people stormed the walls of Constantinople in 1453. After the great siege failed, the Attilids who had been humiliated by the Avars into submission earlier in the mid sixth century A D , rose up to reclaim their position as

N othing, how ever, could be fu rther from the truth. T he legacy o f the H uns w as

were the ‘Scythians’ of Odoacer, the Torcilingian Huns, Rogi, Sciri and the Heruls, all originating from the Hunnic Empire. How this confederation of tribes from the Hunnic Empire came to militarily dominate what was left of the Western Roman Empire is explained differently by our various sources. Jordanes (Getica 4 6 .2 4 2 ; Romana 3 4 4 ) in the sixth century describes Odoacer as the king of an independent barbarian army, who invaded Italy and overthrew Orestes, a conventional conquest in other words. Later John of Antioch (fr. 209 (l)) in the seventh century noted that Odoacer the son of Edeco was together with the barbarian strongman and king-maker Ricimer when the latter overthrew the Western Roman emperor Anthemius in 4 7 2 AD . Procopius, however, confusingly describes Odoacer as one of the emperor’s bodyguards (5 .1 .6 ). This has led some historians to argue that what happened in 4 7 6 AD was not an invasion of barbarians as Jordanes would have it, but essentially a coup d’etat inside the Roman Empire by disgruntled Roman soldiers. Given the composition of this socalled ‘Roman’ army, however, which was almost entirely made up of tribes originating from the Hunnic Empire and all of them tribes deeply associated with Odoacer (e.g. he was personally the king of the Torcilingi and by birth a Rogian, the Sciri are his mother’s people and the Heruls were allies of the Sciri under Edeco in the Danubian region), it is impossible to treat the overthrow of Orestes and Romulus as an internal ‘Roman’ affair. Even Orestes was after all the secretary of Attila the Hun.
It is likely th at b oth versions o f O d o acer’s arrival in Italy, one as the king o f a conquering b arb arian arm y and the oth er as an officer in the R om an arm y, are
co rrect to an exten t, but th ey each view O d oacer from different perspectives.

sign ifican t p o rtio n o f th e ‘R o m an ’ a rm y o f Italy w as alread y con tro lled b y h im
and this gave him the p ow er to interfere w ith R om an internal politics.
O d oacer probably first entered Italy during the reign o f A nthem ius (4 6 7 -7 2 AD)
w ith an arm y th at he had gath ered in Pann on ia and N oricum , perhaps at the
invitation o f A n th em ius him self w ho m ay have w ished to ch eck the p ow er o f R icim er’s ‘R o m an ’ a rm y w ith in Italy b y b rin gin g in a n ew b arb arian arm y . This
m ay h ave been interpreted b y P rocop iu s as O d oacer b ecom in g the em p eror’s
‘b o d y g u a rd ’. H o w e v e r, h e w a s c le a rly n o o rd in a ry ‘b o d y g u a rd ’. A s so o n as he
arrived, instead o f gu arding the em peror, O d oacer seem s to have colluded w ith
R icim er in a coup (John o f A n tio ch ’s accou nt). A s w e have seen earlier, he then
played a critical role in defeating the invading arm y o f V idim er’s G oths during the later reign o f G lycerius (4 7 3 - 4 AD).
O d oacer then fell out w ith G undobad, R icim er’s nephew and successor, w h om
he seem s to h ave expelled from Italy in 4 7 3 AD. T he king o f the T orcilin gi th en
had the hapless em peror G lycerius replaced w ith N epos, the E astern R om an

at the in stigation o f O restes, his lon g-tim e acq u ain tan ce at the cou rt o f A ttila the
H un. T he H unnic con n ection m ade O restes and his son R om ulus ideal candid ates
for the form er H unnic troops and their leader O doacer to use as figureheads.



Orestes made lavish promises, but when he failed to live up to his side of the
bargain, the game was up.3 Odoacer swiftly executed Orestes and then established himself as king of Italy. Thus, the Roman Empire in the west was definitively ended as a political entity by former Hunnic troops governed by a prince of Hunnic origin, Odoacer. Marcellinus Comes declared that the Roman Empire in
the west perished with the deposition of Romulus by Odoacer.4 Odoacer’s control over Italy turned out to be brief and he was overthrown by another prince with Hunnic ancestry, Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogoths and the Lombards, who eventually became the rulers of post-Roman Italy, were both however like the confederacy led by Odoacer, also political units formed out of the former Hunnic Empire. There can therefore be no doubt that the end of the Western Roman Empire was brought about by the Huns. The notion that the Hunnic-Germanic princes Odoacer and Theodoric ruled Italy as mere regents of the Eastern Roman emperor and therefore the new Italy was still Roman and the overthrow of Romulus by Odoacer was insignificant is clearly incorrect. The two ‘barbarian’ kings were independent monarchs of a new political entity. Cassiodorus in the Variae uses imperial vocabulary to refer to the
Ostrogothic kingdom, calling it an imperium of Theodoric (1.42) and repeatedly
uses the phrase imperium italiae.5 This is no doubt a reflection of the
understanding of Theodoric himself who considered his realm an imperium separate from the Roman Empire of the east and similar, but different from the Western Roman Empire that had preceded it. Both Theodoric and Odoacer before him occasionally adopted a subservient pose to ward off Eastern Roman intervention in western affairs, but they saw themselves as rulers of independent kingdoms. This is confirmed by the fact that Odoacer appointed his son Thela as Caesar without any authorization from Constantinople. Clovis the Frank (whose Frankish kingdom we will discuss shortly), who was geographically more distant from Constantinople and had literally nothing to fear from the East Romans, was more brazen in his imperial pretensions than even Odoacer. He allowed his followers to hail him as an Augustus in 5 0 7 AD and minted coins with his own name and image in place of
the emperor.6 Despite all the rhetoric of respecting the Eastern Roman emperor and Roman imperial traditions the two kings of ‘barbarian’ Italy, like Clovis in Gaul, reigned as independent rulers in practice, but at the same time they also wished and needed to be recognized by the native Romans as legitimate rulers. This was partly due to the ever-present fear of eventual re-conquest by the Eastern Roman Empire (something which Clovis did not need to fear due to the luxury of distance). We have in fact already seen earlier in the book a very similar situation in China after the Xiongnu Hun and Xianbei conquests of that civilization in the fourth century AD. Xiongnu, Xianbei and other non-Chinese rulers adopted Chinese titles, surnames and state names, employed Chinese bureaucrats and paid lip-service to respecting Chinese imperial traditions and mores. These measures were obviously designed to placate the conquered native population and to give the Chinese the false impression that nothing much had changed. Some of these ‘barbarian’ kingdoms of northern China at times even professed allegiance to the ‘legitimate’ Chinese Empire of the Eastern Jin to the south when it was politically



and m ilitarily expedient to do so, w hile at the sam e tim e zealously safe-guarding
their independence.
W e should in terpret the behaviour o f both O d oacer and T heodoric in the sam e
w ay , since th ey, like th eir In n er A sian co u n terp arts in C h in a, w ere faced w ith
v ery sim ilar con strain ts and problem s. B oth kings show ed a w illingness to abide
by, at least outw ardly, established R om an precedents. So, T heodoric accep ted the ‘com m ission ’ from the E astern R om an em p eror Zeno (som ething w h ich he
him self had proposed to C onstantinople at a tim e w hen he had been w arrin g
again st the R om ans p eriodically), to ‘legitim ately’ o verth row the ‘u su rp er’
O doacer. B efore the R om an elite T heod oric pretended, at least initially, to rule as
th e em p ero r’s v icero y in the w est.7
T he fact th at this w as m erely em p ty rh eto ric (like the em p ty p ron ou n cem en ts
o f allegiance b y som e n on-C hinese rulers o f n orth ern C hina, m entioned above, to
th e n ativ e so u th ern C h in ese ru lers) is sh o w n b y w h a t follow ed . T h e G oth s did n ot w ait for an y au th orization from C onstantin ople b efore declaring T h eod oric king
o f I ta ly , a lth o u g h T h e o d o ric h im s e lf ch o s e th e title Gothorum Romanorumque rex,

w as less th an a m ere form ality th at could easily be ignored or utilized to th eir
ad van tage depending on the co n text. T heod oric certain ly m ad e good use o f his
‘com m ission ’ from E m p eror Z eno to subjugate and ren d er docile the R om an
p opu lation o f Italy, w h o still con sidered th e au th o rity o f th e em p eror o f th e east to
be legitim ate. T h eod oric for his ow n con ven ien ce allow ed and at tim es even
actively encouraged the R om ans to en tertain the pleasant fiction th at nothing had
really ch anged in Italy. In the sam e w ay O doacer, before T h eod oric’s arrival, w en t
so far as to m int coins in the n am e o f N epos (n om inal W estern em peror, exiled
from Italy) w h om he had helped overth row and later m inted those o f Zeno, the
eastern em peror, for the sam e p urpose.8

A ccord in g to both Fred egar and G regory o f Tours (a m ajor source o f

gen eral A egidius ruled over the Franks for eight y ears as king during C h ild eric’s
exile in T huringia. S cholars taking G regory for his w ord have thus dated
C h ild eric’s exile to 4 5 6 AD an d his retu rn to 4 6 3 AD, w h en he is th ou gh t to h ave
form ed som e kind o f an alliance w ith the R om an s again st the V isigoths.
However, these dates simply do not make any sense in the light of what we know about Aegidius’ activities in Gaul and the 24 year reign attributed to

th at the bulk o f the Franks (Salians) revolted from A egidius and reverted back to
C hilderic because A egidius, h aving been tricked b y the H un W iom ad , tried to

We see exactly the same system in operation among the Franks and other Germanic and later Slavic peoples after the break-up of the Hunnic Empire in the fifth century AD. As noted above the Turko-Mongol and Iranian states of Inner Asia were distinguished by their observation of the dynastic principle buttressed by the notion of the sacred, hereditary charisma of the ruling royal clan. The concept was pervasive among the Kushans, the Turkic tribes of the fifth century AD and also among the Rouran who co-existed with the Huns (Wei Shu 103.2294=Bei Shi 98.3255). The Bulgars who succeeded the Huns in Europe not
surprisingly also stressed the sacred, divine origins of their ruling dynasty.30 It should come as no surprise then that the Franks, whose kingdom was established with Hunnic support, in imitation of their Hunnic patrons, likewise stressed the sacred charima of the ‘long-haired kings’ of the ‘Frankish’ Merovingian dynasty descending from Childeric and Clovis. The Franks, like the Inner Asian Huns, Turks and Mongols, displayed astonishing attachment to this dynastic principle in sharp contrast to the situation we find in the preceding Roman and Germanic contexts where the dynastic principle never really took root and so-called dynasties never lasted for more than three or four generations (in fact ruling dynasties lasting for three or four generations were exceptional by Roman standards, most lasted barely two generations). The adoption of the Inner Asian brand of legitimacy and dynastic principle led to the establishment of long-lived dynasties in Europe upheld by the notion of sacred charisma and divinely sanctioned authority. Fascinatingly enough the elite Avars (who were mostly Hunnified after their entry into Europe), who ruled in Central and Eastern Europe during the same time as the Merovingians in Western Europe, were also noted by the East Romans for their long ‘snaky’ hair. Corippus in his Laudem Justini Augusti Minoris, line 262, talks about how the pagan Avars ‘filled the spacious halls with their long hair’. Agathias (Histories 1.3.4) actually compares the long hair of the Avars with that of the Franks. The stunning similarity in customs between the two contemporaneous groups, both heavily influenced by the Huns and identifying elite status with long hair, may not be an accident. It can also be noted that in the Hunnic-Gothic confederation of the Ostrogoths their Hunnic ‘Amal’ dynasty was likewise in

o f Inner A sian Em pires such as the H unnic Em pire.
C uriously enough the division o f the kingdom into four parts, an old Inner
A sian political p ractice (recall the four m ain divisions o f the X ion gn u Em pire w ith
su b-divisions in each h a lf o f th e dual system m en tion ed earlier), is rep eated again an d again in Fran k ish h istory. T he M erovin gian k in gdom so m ew h at like th e

O strogoths, w ho derived from the H unnic Em pire and w ho w ere ruled by a

T he B urgundians also evolved into a m edieval kingdom after being conquered

In M erovingian G aul the pow er and privilege o f this m ilitary nobility w as just



as great as in Tuoba China. Without the support of this aristocracy the kings could not exercise power effectively. Thus Gundovald in 585 AD was eliminated when he lost the support of the military nobility and was abandoned by his retinue. The Lombards, another Germanic political group influenced by the Huns, were also dominated by this very Inner Asian brand of military nobility. The nobles in the Lombard polity were so powerful that after the deaths of Kings Alboin and Cleph they did not even bother to elect another king for the next ten years until the
elevation of Authari as king in 584.51 Gradually these Inner Asian type military nobles throughout Germanic Europe evolved into the medieval feudal lords with

Starting w ith the Slavic peoples o f E astern Europe, the political culture o f the

volum es about the intensity o f Inner A sian influence on the eastern Slavs long
before the w ell-know n im pact o f the later M ongols on the eastern Slavs betw een
the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries AD. M ovin g on to th e w estern Slavs in C en tral E urope, th e im p act o f In n er A sian



Hunnic and then Avar rule on them was equally profound. The first independent kingdom among the Slavs, according to the Chronicle o f Fredegar (Book 4. 48), was brought into being by the rebellion of the sons of the Huns born from the wives and daughters of the Slavs, Filii Chunorum quos in uxores Winodorum et
filias generaverant tandem non subferentes maliciam ferre et oppression,
Chunorum dominatione negantes-ceperant revellare. The Huns mentioned here in Fredegar are probably not the Attilid Huns, but the largely hunnified Avars and possibly also elements of the Bulgar Huns who together with the Avars constituted the ruling core that created the Avar Khaganate in the second half of the sixth century.
T he story told b y Fred egar suggests th at the H u n -A vars had a significant

In fact the late sixth cen tu ry AD E ast R om an m ilitary treatise attributed to the

and m ilitary p ractices in gen eral som etim es paid o ff h and som ely for the R om ans.
A gathias (1.22.1) for instance describes how N arses, the E ast R om an gen eral in

N o less im p ortan t w as the critical role o f the A lans in dissem inating Inner A sian m ilitary cu ltu re (w hich th ey shared in com m on w ith H uns) to W estern
Europeans. The A lans o f Inner A sia w ere conquered b y the Huns and m ost of

th erefore possible to reg ard the A lan s and H uns as form in g a single closely linked C en tral A sian cu ltu ral unit, though th ey w ere at tim es politically and ethnically

Unlike the H uns w ho for the m ost p art posed as the d estroyers o f R om an

R om an arm y m entioned above w ere by no m ean insubstantial. In G aul and Italy
in p articu lar the A lans b ecam e the core o f the R om an im perial arm y and served
the em pire loyally in its w ars again st the G oths and the H uns. For in stan ce the

In the east too A lan influence rose to unparalled heights w hen A spar, the son o f
the A lan general A rdaburius, b ecam e the de facto k ing-m aker o f the E astern

the east, but in the w est the cru cial role o f the A lans continued.
After the death of the above mentioned Visigothic king Alaric, his successor Athaulf decided to take his Visigoths into Gaul and there the Goths were again frustrated by a group of Alans at the siege of Vasatae in 414 AD. These Alans, who had initially sided with the Goths, switched sides and became the federate allies of

In order to accu rately analyze the cu ltu ral influence o f the H uns w e m u st also

influences had already been seeping into Europe for over a th ousand years before the arrival o f the H uns. M uch o f southeastern Europe from H u n gary to the

Thus, th ere w ere elem ents o f Inner A sian culture already deeply ingrained in
the artistic traditions o f C entral and even to som e exten t W estern Europe before
the arrival o f the H uns. In the S arm atian -A lan ic period th at follow ed the Scythian
h egem on y, m ost n oticeab ly in the third cen tu ry AD, eastern steppe m otifs and art
styles started to have a m ajor im p act on W estern E u rasian steppe art. This can be
seen m ost clearly in the design o f the so-called ‘S arm atian ’ gold diadem s. The gold diadem had been in p rod u ction since m u ch earlier in the eastern steppes and
sam ples o f early Saka-H unnic diadem s in the sam e or sim ilar style as the later

groups had by then b ecom e so sim ilar in term s o f m aterial culture via a long
exten d ed period o f intense accu ltu ration . The fusion o f elem ents o f Sarm atian and
H unnic cultures can already be noted in the later centuries o f the first m illennium
BC in the A ltai region, the hom eland o f the E uropean H uns, alm ost five centuries

influencing th em and being influenced b y th em in turn. The culture and art o f the
H uns therefore w as already hybrid and had a strong Iranian (Sarm atian -A lan )
flavour and vice versa.
T hus, w e m u st first take into con sid eration this h ybrid ity before labelling an y
artefact in the w estern steppes and C en tral Europe during the H unnic Em pire as
specifically belonging to ‘eth n ic’ H uns or Sarm atians. These are erroneous
designations, since the artw ork belongs to the cu ltu re o f the w id er steppe region
ra th e r th a n a sp ecific e th n ic en tity. H o w ev er, sin ce th e n am e H u n is a p o litical as
w ell as a cu ltu ral designation th at em braces all the inhabitants o f the w estern
steppe zone in the fou rth and fifth cen tu ries AD, the art should be labelled
accu rately as H u n nic im perial art. E astern steppe influence w as alread y m aking

These artistic influences em an ating from the eastern steppes had som e

th at had begun w ell before the H unnic invasions o f the fourth cen tu ry AD, b ecam e
all-p ervasive in the follow ing fifth cen tu ry, as the H uns unified the w estern

All these samples naturally pre-date the first samples of Germanic polychrome style art in the fourth century AD. The impact of this very distinctive polychrome cloisonne style of Central Asian art can easily be seen in the artefacts found in the fifth century AD tomb of Childeric the Merovingian king and contemporary Alamannic, Gepid and Thuringian artefacts, which all exhibit unmistakable signs of Hunnic and other Inner Asian influences. The adoption of Hunnic-Danubian burial practices by the Franks and others, exemplified by finds in the tomb of Childeric, was clearly an expression of their desire to associate themselves with Hunnic imperial precedents. Similarly grandiose ‘Danubian’ style burials for leaders following the Hunnic model would become widespread in Western Europe in the following sixth century AD. Not surprisingly perhaps, the finest objects of this polychrome style of steppe influenced art date to the fifth century and they were produced naturally in the lower Danubian region, the core territory of the Huns. Thus the adoption of steppe or steppe-inspired art among the Germanic peoples, which had already begun prior to the arrival of the Huns, was greatly accelerated by Hunnic conquest and the influence of this Hunnic ‘Danubian’ art spread as far north as Scandinavia and as far west as Gaul and Spain. The Huns and Alans therefore brought with them to Europe not only a new political culture, but also new imageries, art styles, motifs and aristocratic values that fundamentally altered the very nature of ‘European’ society and this in turn made the so-called Middle Ages, which they brought about, distinct from the equally magnificent culture of the preceding Roman Empire.

CONCLUSION
The Huns were a Eurasian phenomenon. Consequently their history cannot be fully understood unless we adopt a Eurasian perspective. The Huns established empires and state level entities in virtually every region of the vast Eurasian continent. In Inner Asia, their original homeland, the Huns first established the vast and long-lived Xiongnu-Hun Empire that stretched from Kazakhstan in the west to Manchuria in the east. This formidable Inner Asian Empire subjected the mighty Han Empire of China to tribute and for a time was arguably the most formidable military power in Eurasia. After the fragmentation of the Xiongnu state the Huns split into two major groups, the Northern and Southern groups. The Southern Xiongnu migrated into China, became federate allies/subjects of the Chinese Han dynasty and then eventually overthrew the native Chinese in 311 AD in ways reminiscent of the Hunnic and Germanic overthrow of the Western Roman Empire around 150 years later in 476 AD. The Southern Xiongnu-Hun conquest of China heralded nearly 300 years of Inner Asian domination of northern China. During this time the civilization of China absorbed many Inner Asian influences that later gave the still very Inner Asian Sui-Tang dynasties of China their distinctive cultural characteristics.

The ‘strong’ Huns who migrated further west split again into two groups: the so-called White Huns (or western Huns) of southern Central Asia and the European Huns. The White Huns under the leadership of the Kidarite dynasty erupted into Central Asia, conquering the Kangju and then the formerly Kushan territories of eastern Iran and Afghanistan from the Sassanians. Later in the second half of the fifth century AD the Kidarites dynasty was displaced by a new dynasty supported by the Rouran, the Hephthalites, who took over the rulership of the White Huns. These Hephthalites after eliminating the Kidarites would also conquer both Sassanian Persia, which they turned into a vassal state, and much of Gupta India. In both Iran and India the legacy of the Huns was profound. In Iran the shock of Hunnic conquest facilitated the birth of a Sassanian royal, ‘national’ history or pseudo-history, a body of literature that would sustain the Iranian identity through long periods of foreign rule during the Middle Ages. In India the Indianized Huns fought off the Arab conquest and the spread of Islam for nearly 400 years, thereby safeguarding the future of the Hindu religion and way of life.



Finally the European Huns emerged like a whirlwind in Europe and conquered all before them. They first overwhelmed the Alans and Goth in Eastern Europe. They then conquered all of ‘Scythia’ and ‘Germania’, subjected both halves of the Roman Empire to tribute and fundamentally altered the political geography of Europe. Their arrival and the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire that followed marked the beginning of a new kind of Europe, a ‘Medieval’ Europe. Thus the impact and geographical scope of the Huns and their conquests were truly Eurasian in character. Wherever they arrived they brought with them a very heterogeneous Inner Eurasian culture that radically altered the culture and destinies of the host population. The Huns of Eurasia were neither a race nor strictly an ethnic group. The name Hun denoted the concept of Inner Asian imperial rule. It was first and foremost the political appellation of an imperial state or a proto-state with imperial dimensions. In both the east and the west the ruling Huns were a heterogeneous elite speaking multiple languages and possessing multiple identities and ethnic backgrounds. Their primary linguistic and ethnic core in the west seems to have been Oghuric Turkic, but this core element co-existed with significant Iranian and Germanic sub-groups, who just as much as the Turkic Huns constituted the body of the Hunnic state. Contrary to the image of the primitive horde of nomadic barbarians that they were presumed to be in both traditional and even some contemporary literature, the Huns were politically sophisticated, highly well organized and in military terms superior to their western and eastern adversaries. They would introduce into Europe a new mode of government, a system of rule that would later be defined as ‘feudalism’ or proto-feudalism. The Germanic peoples of Europe adopted this system of collective rule by a supreme king, multiple sub-kings and a militarized nobility regulated by a highly developed ranking system from the Huns and other Inner Asians who accompanied the Huns into Europe. The new mobile mode of war based on cavalry armies of heavily armoured knights which characterized medieval warfare and the aristocratic values that permeated this militarized medieval elite were also residues of Hunnic Inner Asian rule and influence. The new rulers of Early Medieval Europe were also for the most part either Huns by origin or former Hunnic subjects. Those of Hunnic origin were Odoacer the son of Edeco, the first barbarian king of Italy; Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogothic king of Italy who displaced him; Theodoric’s father or uncle Valamer, ‘the king of the Huns’ and founding king of Ostrogoths; and in all likelihood also Ardaric the king of the Gepids. Rulers of non-Hunnic origin, but formerly subjects of the Hunnic Empire, were Childeric, founding king of the Franks enthroned by the Hun Wiomad, and ironically Orestes, the father of Romulus Augustulus (the last ruler of the Western Roman Empire), who had formerly served as the secretary of Attila the Hun. Other Germanic kings of the west were likewise heavily influenced by Inner Asians. The Vandal kingdom of North Africa was arguably as much Inner Asian Alan as Germanic Vandal. The Visigoths who would establish a kingdom in Spain and southern France were likewise recipients of Inner Asian cultural and political influence. The art and material culture of the Huns and Alans had an equally profound impact on all these Germanic Western European kingdoms, leading to the birth of a hybrid and heterogeneous artistic style which we now call ‘Early



Medieval’ and ‘Danubian’. Lastly the Huns brought about a veritable geopolitical revolution in Western Eurasia. The western fringe of Eurasia was forever after the Hunnic conquest politically separated from the Mediterranean basin. This led to the emergence of the ‘Western world’ as we know it, a distinct Western European entity freed from Mediterranean hegemony. The political and cultural ethos of this new Europe was born out of the complex fusion of Inner Asian Hunnic/Alanic, Mediterranean Greco-Roman, Germanic and Near Eastern Judeo-Christian traditions and cultural norms. By ending the Western Roman imperium the Huns facilitated the birth of a Western European identity. The emergence of the Huns also began the millennium of virtual Inner Asian monopoly of world power, with minor interludes, until the rise of Western European powers in early modern times. The Huns, therefore, left an enduring legacy to the Modern World and radically changed the face of the Ancient World across the whole of Eurasia. The history of the Huns and Inner Asia is of critical importance for our understanding of world history. It is about time that the Huns and other Inner Asians are allotted their proper place in human history, as one of the great ancient peoples who changed the world.
