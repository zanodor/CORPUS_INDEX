INTRODUCTION
The study of myths invites several alternative methods of approach. Perhaps the easiest is to take every story as falling into the category of children's tales or of incredible religious origins, without any endeavour to relate it to the general scheme of events. Another is to consider all myth as symbolical, in which case the identification of the symbols will vary from solar deities to aspects of good and evil according to the fashion of the period. The method adopted in this work has been to endeavour to relate these tales to the shadowy beginnings of history, in the hope that it will eventually be possible to fit them into the threedimensional jig-saw puzzle formed by our cultural, historical, and religious background. It must frankly be admitted that progress is slow and that the desired aim will not be attained for several generations, but it is felt that the establishing of the principle and the small beginnings here shown are essential as a foundation. Myth may best be described as the gossamer cloak of folk memory overlaying the bare bones of pre-history. In attempting to understand it, consideration should be given to the possibility that primitive man in telling these stories was not guilty of deliberate misrepresentation but rather that owing to his inability to perceive the relationship between cause and effect, or to distinguish between fact and prejudice, we are presented in them with a series of glimpses of history as seen through the eyes of children. While the dating of myths is still extremely difficult, the following tentative sequence of mythical patterns may form a useful standard of reference. The oldest stories which have come to us appear to be the creation myths. This is not because primitive man could be expected to remember the actual creation, but because the majority of these stories refer to tire emergence of humanity into a new' life after some great catastrophe, an occurrence of such magnitude to the narrators that the mere fact of survival seemed like a rebirth. Their genuineness is shown by the fact that they date back to periods when philosophic or scientific doctrines as to the beginning of things had not yet been evolved. Those which are of later date frequently bear the imprint of the abstract religious philosophies of the Hellenistic schools of the Middle East and should be considered as theological conceptions rather than as true myths.

INTRODUCTION
Manv creation inytlis date back to tbe period when men lived
in caves, although with few exceptions the stories referring to cave
life come from the Americas. There is a distinct possibility that
these caverns were places of refuge rather than favoured dwelling
places, but until further work has been done on the interpretation of the petroglyphs and cave paintings, in their relationship to
myth and legend, this question must remain open.
The hundreds of deluge and fire myths all belong to this period, and can usually be fitted into the following pattern:
1. The Tribal Deity is displeased with humanity and threatens to punish them by driving them from the Elysian Fields or earthly
paradise. 2. There are signs and portents in the heavens, such as the changing of the course of one or more of the heavenly bodies. 3. The Ancestor (man or woman) is warned of approaching disaster, and advised to flee to some high mountain, to a place of refuge, or to build a ship. 4. He does so and is mocked by the wicked and impious. 5. The time of trial begins. There are cyclones and hurricanes, quantities of rocks and stones falling from above, volcanic eruptions, followed by vast fires, which are only extinguished by the heavy rains and the uprising of the waters of the great deep, which cause a flood on a vast scale. 6. The waters eventually drain away and the ancestor sets about the founding of a new race. In order to do this he is forced to resort to incest or other desperate expedients. Many
legends tend to begin at this point—presumably because there were
only a few survivors but no leader—with the Deity surveying the
watery waste and considering ways and means of beginning again. In the Americas there are several stories of survivors digging themselves out of caves which have fallen in. 7. Some myths give details of the re-establishment of life and even go so far as to provide genealogical trees Unking historical rulers with the great ancestors.
Following after the creation myths come the stories of the mother goddesses, dating back to the matriarchal system of Ufe,
when the wise woman of the clan or tribe was just beginning that evolution which reached its zenith when she was the titular representative of the Great Mother, and with her college of priestesses attended the annual or half-yearly fertility festivals, at which her last consort was slain and eucharistically devoured
or her new consort was chosen and together with his cohort
ritually fathered the next generation of royal children. The
stories of virgin birth originate in this period and seem merely to
x



INTRODUCTION
refer to the results of ritual cohabitation when the father remained unknown and the ranlc and inheritance came through the mother.
The first, mythological trinity may have consisted of mother, daughter, and grand-daughter, the change over to mother, father, and son coming at a later period. The nadir of the mother
goddess was reached when her college of attendant priestesses had
become the covens of popular witchcraft. An interesting corollary
of this process was the change in sex of the early trinity of Moon Father, Sun Mother, and Venus Son to the present Sun Father, Moon Mother, and Venus Daughter, a process which had not been
completed in the Hadramaut at the end of the First World War (in Germanic languages the moon is still of masculine gender). It does not fall within the province of this work to follow up the supersession of the early Trinity myths by the religions of to-day, but nevertheless this should not be overlooked : there is scarcely a religious ritual of any of the present-day churches which has not its roots in the far distant past. The fact that many goddesses, particularly in Egypt, assumed the character of the animal totem of their clan, which was in some cases also a sign of the zodiac, would place the switch over from the mother goddesses to the father gods in the Nile Valley at about the time of the invention of the zodiac, which must have been some time before the Sothic Cycle which began in 4326 B.c. That this change coincided with that from nomadic pastoral life to the more settled agricultural existence is reasonably certain, but it does not seem clear why certain major gods changed their sex and others transferred their functions. The conception of non-material deities is of recent date, all the early gods and goddesses having been regarded as endowed with human qualities to a superhuman degree. These early divinities were lusty beings, the dynamic progenitors of races, the leaders of armies, and the sources of wisdom and knowledge, and their vitality was in marked contrast to the pallidity of their successors. In considering the reasons for the change from maternal to paternal gods, it must be recollected that the Semitic tribes in and around the Fertile Crescent have always shown the greatest antipathy to granting women any semblance of equality whether on earth or in heaven, an attitude typified by Saint Paul and later by
Mohammed. The continued debased position of women in the
Arab world to-day shows that this point of view still holds good, although it is still not clear whether the reason is racial, climatic,
or merely pathological.
M
i tli the eclipse of the matriarchy the scene was set for the appearance of the culture hero, and for his rise from the status of a
mere tribal chieftain to being the personal representative of the xi



INTRODUCTION
high gods and, later, to a place amongst them. The elucidation
of the myths of this period is much hampered by our lack of know
ledge whether the names which have come down to us are heredi
tarv titles, military or other ranks, or even nicknames, and also
whether thcv applied to an individual, a family, a tribe, or even a
dynasty. There is also some difficulty in ascertaining which
divine titles and heroic deeds were taken over en bloc from the
tribes whom they defeated and which were at the same time relegated to the powers of evil. It would seem that the theory- of dualism, whereby every- well
disposed divinity is balanced by an evilly intentioned one, may liave had its origin in the need to nullify the powers of the gods or
heroes of a conquered race, or alternatively it may be linked to the taboo against twin children. The idea of the supreme god sitting at the head of a conference table has persisted until the present day, the writer having in his possession a recent Egyptian colour print showing a supreme being surrounded by alternate good and bad minor divinities. The transfer of functions of the gods of the vanquished has had some strange results. For example, Shaitan, the culture hero of some aboriginal tribe living in the Arabian Desert, has in the course of ages become first the archetype of the third species of jinn, and later the evil one of the Christian Church. The Devas, the gods of the pre-Yedic tribes of India, became the powers of evil of the Zoroastrians while remaining the powers of good of the Vedas. In the same manner Set, the original sun god of Upper Egypt, after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, became the chief of the powers of evil, as opposed to Osiris, the leader of the forces of good. Throughout all this period mythology and comparative theology are intermixed, probably because the priest, the king, and the judge were usually the same person, so no conflict of interests was likely to occur. Nowadays all is changed and the most sacred rituals of the past have become children’s games, mimes, or folk dances. It was a writer of the last century who pointed out that the traditional harlequinade, with which the Christmas pantomime used always to finish, was no more than a degenerate representation of the great ones of the past. Mercury, Pan, Diana, and Zeus
being metamorphosed into Harlequin, Pantaloon, Columbine, and
Clown.
European myth has suffered greatly from the impact of Christianity . It is axiomatic that it is only in countries where the myths
vere actually put into writing before the arrival of missionaries
that they retained any real value for the student. For example,
the Edda of the Scandinavians was put into writing while the old
xii



INTRODUCTION
religion still existed, and is therefore a most valuable source. The Arthurian Legends, on tire other hand, were put into writing
after the conversion of the Celts, and have so much extraneous matter introduced that it is difficult to detect underneath it all the stories of Gwydion and other early Celtic heroes, and to realize that the King Arthur who fought the Saxons and the heroes whose deeds make up the cycle of the Round Table probably never heard of each other. The same process is to be noted in the Teutonic versions of the Eddie poems, and particularly, in the Slavonic tales, where the art of writing was brought in by the missionaries and the original background of myth is almost lost. It is a tragic reflection that the zeal of the great ones of the Church has only had the effect of destroying the records of cultures that had existed for much longer before them than the present culture is likely to exist after them. In the Americas several of the pre-Columbian races had evolved a form of writing and had produced whole libraries of picture codices telling of the history of the various tribes. Unfortunately the Spaniards on their arrival, possibly owing to their fear of cultures which were as steeped in blood as their own, destroyed every document which they could find, with the result that nobody has yet succeeded in reading the glyphs of the Mayas, with the exception of dates, and it is improbable that any one will manage to do so. One of the results of this situation is that it is not always possible to match up the tales of the heroes which have come down to us by word of mouth with either the stone carvings which are so prolifically dotted all over the American continent, or even those depicted in the scant dozen codices which escaped the fury of the priests. It has been possible to go fairly deeply into Egyptian myth, thanks to the fact that the ancient Egyptians left behind not only many statues and mural drawings, but also the famous Pyramid Texts and later vast quantities of papyri, vttli the aid of which it has been possible to identify the great majority of their gods and heroes. That the influence of the ancient faith is not yet dead is shown by Egyptian women in the Delta who are in labour
calling on Amoon (Amon) for help, a practice which occurred as late as 1945, giving this religion an effective life of well over six thousand years. Had it not been for its tragic disintegration between 600 b.c. and 450 B.c. under the Greek influence, we should doubtless have had access to many more records of Egypt’s past.
The myths of Mesopotamia are nearly as old as those of Egypt.
The number that have come down to us is, however, far less owing
to the fact that the mud brick of which everything in the Tigris
xiii



INTRODUCTION
Euphrates valleys was built returns to dust after having been
baked in the sun for thousands of years, while the stone blocks of
Egypt arc still much the same as when they were placed in
position. The Tablets of the Creation from the library of King Ashurbanipal, now in the British Ivluscum, are, nevertheless, fuller
than anything which has come down to us from Egypt. These
stories were incredibly old when they were copied in ooo "B.c. and
appear to have been drawn from the same source as that used by
the Hebrews and Phoenicians, while they may also have been
known in pre-dynastic Egypt.
The Renaissance brought to the knowledge of the western
world the treasuries of Greek and Roman myth, to become the inspiration for poetry and art and the backbone of classical education. It is a matter for regret that no such impetus was available for the myths of India, and that Indian studies have produced no Pauly Wissowa to assist in disentangling the original stories from the two hundred and twenty thousand lines of the Maliabharata, the ninety-six thousand lines of the Ramayana, and other large-scale epics. If the tendencies towards multilimbed gods and goddesses, vast numbers of years outrunning the longest time scales for the existence of the earth, and the accentuation of the procreative motif are any indication, the Hindu religion is now in the full flood of decay and in a few short generations there will no longer be any fresh material on the glorious past of the Vcdic races available for the student. The myths of Africa and Australasia have suffered greatly from the well-meant intentions of missionaries and educationists and in the last hundred years most of them have already been forgotten, a process assisted by tbe inability of the average tribesman to commit his stories to writing. Doubtless the social psychologist and the anthropologist may manage to extract a few more details, but in general the future will lie mainly in the intensive study of material already to hand. While the work of the mythographer is not always as spectacular as that of the archaeologist, it must be remembered that had it not been for the mythical tales of Troy, Schliemann would never have dug there and another chapter of history would have remained closed. The study of myths establishes a link between prehistory and history', emphasizes that all gods were once men, and
shows that the marvellous element in these stories is mainly due to misunderstanding, although it is just possible that an occasional
forerunner df modem inventions may have made a spasmodic and
short-lived appearance. Ihe kinship of myths originating from adjacent and even
distant countries shows that the diffusion of cultures was a marked xiv

factor in the cultural development of mankind in the prehistoric period. This possibility is confirmed by the apparent lack of originality in religions, each of which seems to stem from its predecessor with grafts from contemporary opposing groups. One day perhaps it will be possible to investigate religious systems from a mythical basis; the results of such a study should be of
great interest. Readers will note that what is perhaps the greatest untapped store of myth now existing, the One Thousand and One Nights, being the stories of the merchants and captains who roamed the area between the Mediterranean and the Pacific, long before Islam had been brought into being or Haroun al-Rashid born, has not been broken down for inclusion in the present work. This is regretted, but it would have doubled the size of the present volume, in addition to causing its publication to be deferred for several years.
INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
The gulf which has separated myth, legend, and folklore, on the one hand, and historical, archaeological, and anthropological research on the other, may be said to have narrowed to a considerable extent during the ten years which have elapsed since this dictionary was first written. It is as if students of the past and its mysteries had suddenly discovered that they had had a first-class crib to all the subjects being studied, which had lain neglected at their feet for years, while all the time it contained the answers to practically all the questions they were asking. Naturally it was galling to some to have to seek for knowledge from stories which had, in many cases, arrived at a stage of being only found on the nursery bookshelf, but this should not have been so as the true scientist takes his knowledge where he can find it and is not snobbish about its origins.
We have now reached a stage in the world’s history where the untapped sources of historical raw material are restricted to three or four groups. These are the Orthodox churches of Russia, many of which have libraries which are only now coming to light; Mus
lim and Christian foundations in the Near East; Buddhist libraries in Tibet and China ; and finall}' the large stores of books available

INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
in India which nobody has got down to even reading, much less
translating. Here will doubtless be found the travel diaries of early sea
captains together with their maps, the poems composed in honour of victor}' or defeat, the stories of gods and heroes as told for popular consumption, and other bits of valuable information which have somehow managed to escape the blue pencil of the
religious censor.
Recent examples of this have been the Piri Reis map of the Atlantic Ocean drawn up years before Columbus; the Dead Sea Scrolls, which have caused a great shifting of emphasis for the period 200 b . c . to a . d . 200; the recent Soviet investigations on the return route of the Argonauts; the strong relationship in early dynastic times between Egyptian and Slavonic legends; the fascinating linkage between hill figures in Cambridgeshire, the Lady of Coventry who rode on a white horse as also the one who rode with bells on her fingers and bells on her toes, Gog and Magog, and a matriarchal goddess known from Palestine to Ireland. No reference has been made to the Americas as, although the working out of the relationship between such written documents as we still possess, such as the Popul Vuh and the Maya and Aztec scripts, is still forming the subject of careful study, progress has indeed been much slower than was hopefully anticipated a couple of years ago. This state of affairs is partially due to the fact that whilst in Europe and the Near East every scrap of information, ranging from passages of Halley’s Comet to solar and lunar eclipses, is being carefully studied as a means of checking the dates of historical events, this matter has not by any means received adequate attention in the Americas, with the result that any correlation between the calendar of the Mayas and our own is haphazard in the extreme. Another branch that has not received adequate attention is that of travellers' tales. Whether it was Herodotus or Hanno, Sir John
Mandeville or Marco Polo, Adam of Bremen or Benjamin of Tudela, there has always been a tendency to laugh off the stories of the marvels and miracles encountered by them as being figments of the imagination, instead of accepting them as inadequate descriptions of tilings which were outside the range of compre
hension of those who witnessed them.
An example of this occurs in two of the early Irish voyages,
when it was reported that an island had been seen supported by a
large pillar on which it rested. This has been assumed by most
people to be on the level of Baron Munchliausen. But to anybody
"ho has ever seen the mushroom effect of a volcano in eruption or
of an atomic bomb being exploded, the effect is precisely that of xvi



INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
an island supported on a huge pillar. The fact that the truth as seen by these early mariners was not immediately comprehensible does not imply that they were not telling the truth but merely that thenreaders had not taken the trouble to use logical analysis. That several ethnic groups, including that of the Aryan language
peoples, share a common tradition of myth and legend is well
known to many people, but there is uncertainty as to why and when they were forced apart by circumstances.
A possible explanation lies in the fact that during the period of
the last ice age, when much of Europe and Asia was covered by sheets of ice up to a mile in thickness, the nations sharing this common culture lived sufficiently far from the lower edges to enjoy reasonably good climatic conditions. However, when the ice age came to an end, the sudden melting of vast quantities of ice produced flood waters which turned a large portion of Asia into a series of inland seas, stretching from the Gobi to the Black Sea. While it is not possible to date this with certainty it may be observed that the last great climatic change took place about ioooo B.c., and that by a coincidence the common starting-off points of four of the main calendrical systems of the world, those of Chaldea, Egypt, the Mayas, Vedic India, can be set between 11542 b.c. for the first two and 11653 B.c. f°r the second pair. In addition the date on which the star Anna had been in the 'sanctuary' on 2nd February, the date on which Our Lord was presented in the Temple, has been calculated by Schiaparelli as being in 1x230 b.c. In the year of Our Lord the date was 25th July. It is precisely the differences between these dates which give them the possibility of reality, as it may be taken that after emigrating to a new land the race would take the date of their arrival there as a suitable one for a new calendar. This does not imply that the Mayas, the Egyptians, and the Israelis need have come from the same area but merely that they were equally affected by the worldwide climatic change. With this in the background it is easier to appreciate why most of the cultures with which historians have come into contact show a far greater degree of similarity in their backgrounds than might otherwise have been expected. The tendency on the part of the great research workers of the last century to assume that each race had its separate and peculiar cultural origin has been shown to be based on a fallacy. Modern research shows the reverse to have been the case, that no race can be shown to have experienced any series of cosmic or world catastrophes, or of religious or cultural backgrounds, which is markedly different from that of any other one.



INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
From the date of 11500 b.c. given above it may be said that our
history actuallv begins. For as long as the waters continued to
pour across Asia communication by ship was possible from one end of Asia to the other, and it is in the closing stages of this period that we have such stories of piratical expeditions, such as that of the Argonauts, seeking to loot the wealth of a culture infinitely older than their own. It is possible also that the tales of Sindbad, or of Yamilka, or of the Shipwrecked Sailor, belong to this period.
With the drying up of the waters communication by water ceased, and the land trade routes for amber, furs, silk, spices began to be developed, thus aiding in the prosperity of the petty sovereigns whose kingdoms were enabled to extort a levy on all goods passing through. Gradually, with the building up of minor empires, trade was brought to a standstill, and the manufacture of silk and of swords was brought from the East to Damascus, while amber, being a natural product, became scarce, and Irish blue beads ceased to be exported to such places as Egypt and the Near East. But in spite of all this the memories of the past still remained alive. Haroun al-Raschid, around whom the group of tales known as the Arabian Nights was grouped, was as separated from the period as was the historical King Arthur from the Arthurian Legends. The advent of Christianity resulted in the Pagan gods and heroes being turned into saints, and their deeds revised in accordance with local religious tradition. Nowadays, however, the chromium plate of sanctity is wearing tliin, and underlying it all it is possible to observe the outlines of the original stories. But it must be admitted that we are only at the beginning of the recasting of history in the light of myth and legend, there are generations of work to be done on the subject before we shall have an accurate and valid picture of the past. The process involved in dealing with myth and legend is the simple one of assuming that the narrator told the truth as he saw it. It then becomes a question of a patient search to find a set of facts which give a reasonable correspondence to the story. In doing this it is essential to bear in mind that most early travellers
had been subjected to a Pavlovian preconditioning before their departure, in the anticipation of finding the terrestrial paradise, the fountain of youth, etc., and were, in consequence, likely to trim their accounts to fit in with this. However, truth is like some of the modem plastics, no matter
how much it is deformed by pressure, it always tends to return to its original shape. For example, several of the early Atlantic
travellers told of an island from whence swarms of enormous ants
rushed into the water intent on seizing the ship and its crew. xviii



INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
Many years later the late Professor Rendel Harris pointed out that on approaching the Azores from the East one ran into a series of
dangerous reefs known as the Formigas, or Ant Rocks, a name by which they were known long before the Portuguese officially discovered the islands. And, what is more, Rendel Harris also observed that to an Anglo-Saxon mariner the rendering of Formigas would be the Antilla or Ant Island. This logical reasoning at one stroke cleared up the identity of a mysterious island which had figured on charts of the Atlantic for centuries. It is an unfortunate fact that the relationship between master mariners and early writers was practically nonexistent. As a result there were two parallel streams of information about foreign lands : the stories told by the men who had actually been there for trade or piracy, and the stories of those who had never been there but who knew how to write. The combination between the two produced results which were frequently ludicrous. One remembers being asked by a Persian in Teheran if the Queen Elizabeth was as big as a motor-bus, and by an Egyptian why snow was white and whether one could not keep it. In both cases the difficulty was simply that the Persian had never seen the sea, much less a ship, whilst the Egyptian had never been in a cold region where snow actually fell. The tendency to fasten on to the careers of famous sailors or soldiers a whole series of events, many of which happened years before they were born or after they died, is not confined to myth and legend. Both Drake and Hawkins would have had to live for centuries to do all that has been attributed to them, while the Mayflower must have been larger than several Atlantic liners to carry all the people who were supposed to have been on board. And here we are dealing with recent historical events where verification should be a simple matter. However, we may adopt the following as a rough basis for future research. Every national epic is designed to elevate the warriors, culture, and religion of the race concerned above all others. Defeats are minimized or overlooked, alien religions are vilified and traduced, successful generals have all the victories in a series of campaigns attributed to them, the virtues of rulers are magnified and their vices forgotten. In short they are propaganda designed to restore flagging morale and may be said to have achieved that aim in nearly every case. In reading the Ramayana with the story of Rustum, or the Eddas together with the Kalevala, one is in the same situation as somebody reading a history of the Napoleonic Wars written by a Frenchman, as against the Journal of Wellington's Campaigns, and a Russian account of the attack on Moscow. With a certain



INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION
amount of imagination it is just possible to recognize that they are all three accounts of the same series of events but seen from differing viewpoints. But, nevertheless, to the narrators they all constituted a truthful account of the facts. If we apply the same standard of judgment to all the tales which have come to us from the past the employment of myth and legend to reinforce the shadowy background of history will greatly ease the task of the research worker. E. S. 1961.
Advantage has been taken of the demand for a third edition to enlarge the book by the inclusion of an appendix (pp. 247-63) and two additional illustrations.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
One of the difficulties encountered in delving into non-classical myth and legend is that, apart from the popular collections of tales, the literature on the subject is limited, the great majority of data having to be obtained from the works of specialists in other fields, to whom myth and legend are in the nature of casual interests rather than matter for serious study. The books enumerated in the following bibliography are only pointers to further study and are not to be considered as forming a complete bibliography, which would run into many hundreds of volumes. Many of them are available in cheap editions, the others may be consulted at any good library. In them will be found bibliographies which will assist in the choice of further reading. The wide diversity of the views expressed by the authors should not hinder the student in arriving at a reasonable assessment of the material which is of use to him.

A
God ‘A.’ The death god of the Mayas.t In the codices he is represented as a being with exposed vertebrae and a skull-like countenance. He may be taken to be the same as Mictlantecuhtli,t the Aztec god of the dead, with the difference that while the Aztec deity presided over the north or south his Mayan counterpart presided over the west. His symbol is that for the day Cimi, ‘death,’ his hieroglyph is a corpse’s head and a skull together with a flint sacrificial knife.
Aah-te-Huti. Egyptian moon god, symbolically represented by an Ibis head surmounted by a crescent and a disk. He was a manifestation of Thoth.t
Ab. In Egyptian religiont the will, the emotion and passion of the Egyptian, symbolized by the heart, which was brought up for judgment, in the Book of the Dead.t
Abac. Irish spelling of Addanc.t
Abtu. In Egyptian myth one of a pair of sacred fish which swam before the boat of Rat to warn him of danger. It also announced the rise of the Nile. The other was Anet.t
Achomawi Indian Creation Legend. This tribe of Californian Indians tell that the Creator originally emerged from a small cloud and that Coyote,t who assisted him, came from a land mist.
Adad or Addu. i. Babylonian god of storm and thunder, forming, with Sint and Shamash,t the second Triad of Gods. Was introduced by the Amonites and later became equated with Rammant or Rimmon, his weapons being flood, famine, and lightning. 2. Canaanite god, also known as Martuyt the Amorite, and Kurgal/f the Great Mountain. Probably the Baalt of Mount Lebanon. The cypress was dedicated to him. 3. Syrian god of virility, known as Hadad.t 4. He may be equated to Buriasht and Teshub.t 5. The Kassite and Hittite gods of storm.
Adapa. A sage of Eridu, second king of Babylonia after the Deluge, and who Berosus says reigned 10,800 years ago. Was initiated into wisdom by Eat although eternal life was withheld frorn him. Once, while fishing, the south wind capsized his boat, and in his fury he broke the wings of the wind, which ceased to blow. Anut summoned him to appear for punishment, and Ea, out of jealousy, warned him not to accept anything to eat or drink. However, both Tammuzt and Gishzidat intervened on his behalf, explaining that Ea had revealed all wisdom to him and that if he but I



Adar Aegir
had eternal life he would be a god. Anu then offered him the bread and water of life but he refused, thus losing for ever immortality for
men. Adapa was the mortal with pure hands who helped the bakers of Eridu to make bread and cleared the holy table of the temple there. Some later versions make Adapa the son of Ea.
Adar. In Babylonian myth an alternative name for Ninib,t the god of the summer sun. Addanc. In Celtic myth a dwarft or marine monster who dwelt
by Lake Llyon Lliont and who caused a deluge. He was eventually
disposed of by being hauled from his lair by the oxen of Hu Gadam,t or alternatively, he was killed by Peredur.t His relationship to this
deluge myth is similar to that of Hayagrivat in Hindu legend. An
alternative spelling is Avane,t whilst in Ireland the word was Abac.t Some further details are given in Celtic Creation Legend.!
Aditya. In Hindu myth the mother of the gods from whom
all things sprang. A personification of the generative powers of nature. Daksha,t her son, was later considered as her father, while her husband Vishnut also appeared as her son when he was incarnated as a dwarf. She was the mother of the Adityas, the gods of the months of the year, and in this connection appears to have taken on the stature of a sun goddess. The twelve Adityas were: Ansa,t Aryman,t Bhaga,t Daksha,t Dhatri,t Indra,t Mitra,t Ravi,t Savitriyf Surya.t Varuna,t and Yama.t Aditya was one of the eight Vasus,t the divine attendants of Indra.t
Adonis. In Babylonian myth a title applied to Tammuz,t derived from Adon meaning lord. The classical use of this name probably arose from a misunderstanding of its meaning.
Adsullata. A river goddess of the continental Celts. The resemblance of the name to Suilat would indicate that she may have been a priestess of hot springs.
Aegir. The ocean god of the Norsemen; although accepted as an equal, he was not one of the Aesir.t He is encountered in three of the Eddas; in the Hymiskvida or Lay of Hymir,t he entertained the Aesir at the feast of the autumnal equinox. His supply of drink being too little for Thor,t the latter sets out with Tyrt to capture Odherir,! the magic cauldron of the giants.! Later in the Aegisdrekka, or Carousal of Aegir, the Aesir drink from the cauldron and are grossly' insulted by Lokrt who slays a servant and flees. 1 his Eddie story is also known as the I.okasenna.t It is to Aegir that Bragif tells the stories enumerated in the Bragi-raedur. Aegir seems to be a pre-Nordic culture hero who was too firmly established to be absorbed or displaced by the Aesir. His wife was named
Rant and they' lived with their nine daughters on the Danish island of Hlesey.

Aesir Agassou
Aesir. In Nordic myth the group of leaders forming the entourage of Odin.t Originally there seems to have been a coven of a chief
with a retinue of twelve and it may be assumed that of the seventeen names listed below, never more than a dozen were included at any one time. Their feast day was the Yulet festival of 14th January. The Aesir seem to have arrived in Scandinavia shortly after the
Vanir,! with whom they at first fought and subsequently allied themselves. The stories of their wars against the giants may have related to their struggles with the Finna. The Eddasf tell one side of the story, the Kalevalat and the Hero of Estonia! portions of the
other. Asgard,t the fabled city of the Aesir, with its palaces and assembly halls, may be a memory of their actual capital city before they migrated to north-west Europe. It is possible that some of the names of the Aesir were hereditary titles, whilst others may have been the names of actual people. The following list includes practically all the names of those who belonged to the Aesir at various times: Balder,f Baugi,t Bragi,t Forseti,f Frey,t Heimdal,t Hodur,t Hoeni,t Loki,t Mimir,f Odin,t Thor,t Tyr,f Ullur,! Vali,t Vidar.t Other details are given under Asynjor,t Bifrost,t Dwarfs,t Eddas,! Giants,t Horses,t Nibelungenlied,t Norns,t Ragnarok,! Sumars Blot,t Treasures,t Valkyries,! Volsung,f Volva,! Zodiacal Houses.!
Aesma. The Zoroastrian Deva or evil spirit of wrath, now the modern Khasmf or Khism, to whom was applied the term ‘with the terrible spear.’ He was the inspirer of vengeance and of perseverance in evil; he was third in the hierarchy of demons, his good opponent being Craosa.t In the Book of Tobit he was known as Asmodeus.t
A!. A form of Ra,t the Egyptian sun god, as he nightly journeys through the underworld.
Aflkoman. The Jewish ceremony of hiding the Passover cake
may be equated with Hapit Qementu (Hapi is found). In this case Ilapi was equivalent to Osiris,! and the piece of Passover cake which is hidden in the ritual is Osiris, while the other two pieces, which are not lost, are Isis! and Nephtys.t
Aganju. In Yorubaf myth he was the son of Oduduaf and brother
and husband of Yemaja.t by whom he was the father of Orunjan!
and of sixteen other gods, including Ogun,! Oko,t Olokun,! Shango,! Shankpanna,! the sun, the moon, and several of the river goddesses.
Agassou. Panther fetish! god of the royal house of Dahomey.!

Ahura
Agni
Agni. A fire god of the primitive Aryans who became the divine fire and the spirit of Somat of the Vedic religion. Agni was one of the eight Vasus.t With the development of Brahminism he was one of a triad of gods, the others being Indra/f ruler of the air, and Surya,t ruler of the sky, while he was the ruler of the earth. The numerous references to him in Vedic law show the great importance which was attached to fire by the Indo-Germanic tribes. Horses were sacrificed to him annually, presumably to provide new steeds for his chariot. Matarisvan,t the messenger of the gods, brought Agni to Bhrigu,t the Rishi.f The word ‘ agni’ comes from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘fire,’ and as such has passed into the Slavonic languages.
Ahi. In Hindu myth, an Indian serpent god slain by Trita,t later replaced by Indra,t the war god, of whom it is said: ‘With his vast destroying thunderbolt, Indra struck the darkling mutilated Vritra't (the alternative name for Ahi). In the Vishnu Purana mention is made of a certain Alii Naga,t one of the royal family of Ajudha. In Cambodia the name Naga is generally applied to the seven-headed serpent. In India it means the cobra, with which the ruling families were often connected. Ahi was the son of Danu.f
Ahriman. In Zoroastrian myth the leader of the powers of evil, who is in constant conflict with Ahura Mazda,t the leader of the powers of good. The Devas.t or followers of Ahriman, may well have been the culture heroes and gods of the early Persians before their conquest by the Indo-Germans, and the process of Dualismf may have been designed to offset their attractions for the masses by the increased value given to their opponents, the new gods. It is of interest to note that the name Ahriman was treated in a feminine form in old Persian, which may involve a link with an early mother goddess.
Ahsonnutli. Bisexual god of the Navajot Indians, also known as ‘the Turquoise Hermaphrodite.’ It is possible that he may have
been a later development of the Turquoise Woman, who is frequently
mentioned in Navajo myth. He is considered as the creator of heaven and earth and to have placed men at each of the cardinal points to uphold the sky.
Ahura. In the early Aryan languages there were two general
words for God: Asurat (Zend, Ahura) and Daiva (Sanscrit, Deva,t Zend, Daeva). In the Vedast Deva meant a benign power and
Asura an evil power. To the Zoroastrians Daeva meant an evil
power and Ahura meant a benign one. In Buddhismt both words
had largely lost their meaning.
Ahura Mazda. In the Zoroastrian theogony the chief benign divinity as opposed to Anra Mainyut or Ahriman,t leader of the 4



Ahy Aka-Kanet
powers of evil. The name, which means lord of knowledge, can be assimilated to the Vedic Asura.f Coghp, a fifth-century Armenian historian, tells that Hormazut (or Ahura Mazda) and Ahrimanf were
the twin sons of Zervan Akarana,t one of whom was to be the-creator of the earth and of all tilings good. Just before their birth Zervan
said: ‘He who first comes to me, will I make king.’ Hearing this
Ahriman immediately emerged from his mother’s womb and claimed the throne. Zervan, in order not to break his word, gave him the right to rule for 900 years, after which Hormazut would become supreme ruler. He was also the first of the Ameshas.t
Ahy. In Egyptian myth an alternative name for Herusmatauy,t the son of Horust and Hathor.t
Ailill. In Celtic myth an early king of Connaught whose wife Medbt had formerly been the wife of Conchobar.f The name seems to be that of a dwarft or elf,t which presumably means that he was not of Celtic stock. When Fergus! of Ulster had been defeated by Conchobar he sought refuge at the court of Ailill and was well received.
Aimon Kondi. In the Creation Legend of the Arawaksf of Guiana he scoured the world with fire from which Marerewanat and his followers sought refuge in underground caverns. Later there was a great flood from which the survivors escaped in canoes.
Aino. Heroine of the Kalevalat (the Finnish national epic), sister of Joukahainen,t who is pledged to Vainamoinen.t
Aion. Child of Kolpiat and Baauf in the Phoenician Creation Legend!; with Protogonos,! the parent of Genost and Genea; first to discover edible fruits. The word Aion means life.
Air. (a) In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Damascius, son of Omiclet by Potos,t representing purity without intelligence. He mated with his sister Aura,! and produced Otos,t meaning reason. (b) In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos, Air and Chaost were in the beginning, and produced Windt (Kolpiat) and Desire! (Potost). (c) In the Phoenician Creation Legend! of Mochus, Air and Ether! engendered Oulomos.t
Airavata. In Hindu myth the Elephant of Indra.t An alternative spelling is Airabata. It was one of the objects produced by the churning of the ocean! in the Kurmat avatar.
Airmid. In Celtic myth the daughter of Diancecht,! the god of healing and sister of Miach,! whom she assisted in the healing of Nuda.t
Aizen Myo-O. Japanese! god of love.
Aka-Kanet. A grain and fruit god of the Araucanian Indians.!
He presides over harvest festivals and appears to have originated as a culture hero. His evil counterpart and possibly twin brother was Guecubu.t

Akatauire. In the Mangaiat Island myth he was the brother of Rangi/fthe husband of Ruangeytand one of the co-rulers of the island.
Akra. In Persian myth alternative name for Sinurqh,! the bird of immortality. This word may be related to the Akarana of Zervan Akarana/t the Zoroastrianf Father Time. Akua. In Polynesian myth a generic name for the full gods of Hawaii. Akupcra. In Vedic myth the tortoise on which the earth rests. It has some resemblance to the Kujatat of the Mohammedans. Alaghom Naum. Wife of Patol,! chief deity of the Tzental tribe of the Mayas .t She was known as ‘the Mother of Mind’ and was credited with the creation of mind and thought. She appears to have been a mother goddess whose position was too firm for her to be displaced by her husband. She was also known as Iztat lx.!
Alatuir. The magic stone which in Slavonic! myth was to be found on the island of Bouyan.t From beneath it flowed a river whose waters healed all ailments. At some stage of Slavonic myth Alatuir became a stone at the cross-roads which warned heroes of impending danger, and later still it became the stone on which stood the Cross. Alberich. In the Nibelungenliedt and the Ring Cyclet the dwarft Andvari,! the guardian of the treasures,! is known by this name. As he was also Aelf-Ric the elf king, this presupposes that the position of guardian was hereditary, and that Andvari may have been the family name.
Albiorix. A name given on an inscription at Avignon to a Celtic war god, who may have been Tiwaz.t
Aleion Baal. In Ugarit myth the son of Baal.! He represents an intermediary stage between men and gods, in that in his father’s age-long fight with Mot! both adversaries are killed, only to be resurrected to continue the fight. Aleion is god of the clouds, winds, and rain. He is accompanied by a troop of wild animals, including eight bears. He is god of spring, and possibly that of winter or air. On one occasion he joins with Koser-et-Hasist against his father and is defeated, for which deed he is reproached by Astarte.! Further details are given under Phoenician Creation Legends.
Altar. In Nordic myth there were several groups of dwarfs,! and of these one was named the Alfar. From them comes the word
elf (O.E. czlf) of popular story. A member of the Lovar,! another group of dwarfs, was named Alfr, which may indicate some relationship between these two groups.
Alfatin^ Moorish hero who sleeps with his horse, which is green,
in a cave in the Sierra de Agner from whence he and his steed will 6

Alfheim. The home of the elvest or dwarfst in Nordic myth; the dwelling place of Frey/f and also his zodiacal housed Cf. Scott’s Elfhame, in The Rhyme of True Thomas.
Algonquian Indian Creation Legends. One of the myths of this tribe of Red Indians tells how Manibozho,t their culture hero, took refuge on a mountain when a great lake overflowed and submerged the world. He sent out three messengers in succession, a raven, an otter, and finally a musk-rat, before he was satisfied that the flood had disappeared. Another legend tells how Glooskapt and his twin brother Maslumyf representing the good and evil creative powers, formed the solar system and the human race out of their mother’s body. After defeating Maslum, Glooskap was involved in a series of combats with Kewawkqu,t Medecolin,t Pamola,t Wimpe,t over all of whom he was victorious. A third creation legend of this tribe is given under Gros-Ventrest Indian Creation Legend.
Allah. Islamic name for God. Is derived from Semitic El,t and; originally applied to the moon; he seems to have been preceded by Hmaqah,t the moon god. Allatt is the female counterpart of Allah.
Allantide. The apple time, a Cornish name for Samhain.t The word is related to Avalon.t
Allat(u). Female counterpart of Allaht from the pre-Islamicpantheon condemned by the Koran: ‘What think ye then of Al-Lat?’ She is considered to have been the solar goddess Samas.f The Nabateans considered her as the mother of the gods ; she has also been identified with the virgin mother of Petra described by Epiphanius. Allat is also to be equated with Asheratian.t She is occasionally confused with Ninmug,t or Ereshkigel,t queen of thelower world, who ruled over Aralu,t the Babylon Hades, and was the enemy of Ishtar.t She is akin to the Semitic goddess Elat.t Another variant for her name is Ilat.t
Alviss. A dwarft of Nordic myth w'ho is mentioned in the AlvisMai Eddat as having been promised the hand of a daughter of Thort in marriage. When he went to fetch his bride Thor detained him by asking questions until the dawn came and Alviss was forced to depart alone. The story may relate to an early attempt at alliance between the dwarfs and the pre-Aesir.f Amaite-Rangi. In Mangaiat myth he was a sky demon who was
defeated in battle by Ngaru.t
Amalivaca. Culture hero of the Orinocot River Indians wha taught them to till, the soil and instructed them in the arts of life.

From the marriage of these two sprang eight children, from one of whom the Japanese royal family claims descent. The story of her having shut herself up in the Cave of Heaven as a result of her brother’s ill treatment appears to be an attempt to link the personality of the sun priestess with some great catastrophe of the past. She was the most prominent member of the Shinto Pantheon and her exalted rank shows that she belongs to a period anterior to the adoption of Chinese anti-feminist ideas in Japan. She had a sacred bird, the Yatagarasu,t which may be identified with the Yangwut of Chinese myth.
Amathaon. A wizard in Celtic myth who taught his craft to Gwydion,t nephew of Math Hen.t His theft of a dog and a roebuck from Annwnt caused a battle between Gwydion and Arawnt known as the Battle of the Trecs.t He was the son of Danu.t

were delivered for total destruction the souls and bodies of the unvirtuous.
Amen. The famous cauldron of Ceridwen,t included in the treasures! of Britain.
Ament. In Egyptian myth a mother goddess ; consort of Amon.t

Amenti. In Egyptian myth the Land of the Dead and first region of the Place of Reeds, where dwell souls who lived upon earth offerings. Ruled over by Menuqet.t The name is also given to the West or Other World, as the region of darkness to which souls must go on their way to the Elysian Fields. In the Tuat,t or What is in the Next World, reference is made to the Horn of Ament, the utmost boundary of the horizon of Amenti, as being one of the boundaries of the Elysian Fields. Other regions were Sekhet-Aaru,t SekhetHetep,t Sekhet-Tchant.t Also known as Pet.t

Amirini. In Yorubat myth an early goddess.
Amon. A pre-dynastic Egyptian god, so ancient that he is never found alone but always in association with some other god such as Raff As Amon-Ra he was ‘ king of the gods, creator of the universe, lord of Karnak, and father of the Pharaohs.’ He was Great God of Thebes, and became Supreme Deity of Egypt during the eighteenth dynasty. His theophany was a ram. The Triad of Thebes was composed of Amon-Ra, his wife Mut,t and his son Khensu.t Originally he appears to have been a god of agriculture, and as such became associated with death.

The birds and climbing animals took refuge on the tree tops while the others were led by Sigu into a cave where they remained in safety until the disaster was over. There are other variants of this myth in Guiana. Aimon Kondi,! who may be taken to be the same as Makonaima, first burnt the world with fire from which those who took refuge in caverns were the only ones to escape. They included Marerewanat and his followers. The Macusis believe that the survivors of the deluge turned stones into human beings to populate the earth. In the Tamanac

Aruru.

In Babylonia she became Ishtar.t By the Greeks she was equated with Aphrodite,t who would appear to be the same but in a new setting.

Azidahaka
Azidahaka. In the Zoroastrian Creation Legendt the serpent
demon who overthrew Yima,t the first mortal, and cut him in twain.
The name Azidahaka appears to have been borne by a dynasty of
serpent-worshipping kings of Media which finished with Bevarash,t who was overthrown by Fariduf and condemned to be bound to Mount Demavand. This Bevarash has been equated with the
Astyages who was overthrown by Cyrus. One of the Azidahaka fought a great battle with Thraetona,t an early Persian culture hero.
Azrael. Name given to the Islamic angel of death * who is charged with you and shall cause you to die’ (Koran, Sura 32, 11).
Aztec Creation Legends. The myths of the Aztecs as to the Creation tell that the ‘first earth’ with its inhabitants was destroyed by a great flood caused by Atonatiuh, the water sun, who was subsequently equated with Tlaloc.t The human beings who survived this catastrophe were then exposed to a series of earthquakes caused by the wind sun, and it was the survivors of this latter disaster who were the ancestors of the Mexicans. These stories are a mixture of the disaster legends of two races, possibly the Toltecs and the pre-Toltec aborigines. There is a mother goddess Tlazolteotlf who is described as ‘The Woman who sinned before the Deluge,’ and Nata and Nenat were one of the human pairs who survived the inundation by building themselves a ship. In the same manner Xelhua,t the giant,t survived by climbing to a mountain top. Those who escaped the Deluge and/or the wind storms by taking refuge in caverns handed down the story of Chicomoztoc.t The Cavern of the Seven Chambers is similar to the Tulan-Zuivat of the Quichest and may have been the origin of Mictlan,t the Aztec Hades.
By the time the Spaniards arrived in Mexico these legends were so ancient as to have been partially forgotten, and the stories of the Deluge seemed to centre mainly around Tlaloc,t the rain god, to
whom large quantities of children were sacrificed annually in the hope of obviating further disasters of this nature. Other details may be seen under the various Aztec gods and beings, a list of which is given under Aztec Religion.
Aztec Religion. It is rarely in the history of the religions of the world that one is encountered which is quite so cruel and sanguinary as that of the Aztecs. To the original festivals of the agricultural deities of the primitive tribes was grafted on a superstructure of bloody sacrifice such as is without parallel. The tens of thousands of victims whose hearts were cut out and thrown on the altars of various gods, or who were flayed alive in order to provide garments
and masks for the priests appear to have contributed largely to that decline in morale which enabled the Spaniards to occupy the country
with such ease. It is an interesting speculation whether the fact 24



Aztec Aztlan
that syphilis had been endemic in Mexico for generations may have in any way contributed towards these violent religious excesses. Details as to the activities of the various gods and beings will be found under the following headings : Apochquiahuayan,t Aztlan, Camaxtli,t Chalchihuitlicue,t Chantico,t Chicomecoatl,f Chicomoztoc,t Cibola,t Cihuacoatl,t Cihuateteo,t Cinteotl,t Citlallinicue,t Coatlicue,t Ehecatl,t Huahuantli,t Huehueteotl,f Huitzilopochtli,t Huixtocihuatl,t Ilamatecuhtli,t Itzlacoliuhqui,t Itzli,t Itzpapalotl,t Ixcuina,t Ixtlilton,t Lords of the Day and Night,t Macuilxochitl,t Metztli,t Mictlan,f Mictlancihuatl,t Mictlantecuhtli,t Mixcoatl,t Nata and Nena,t Omacatl,t Omeciuatl,f Ometecuhtli,t Opochtli,t Piltzintecuhtli,t Quetzalcoatl,t Tecciztecatl,t Teoyaomiqui,t Tepeyollotl,t Teteoinnan,t Texcatlipoca,t Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli,t Tlaloc,t Tlaltecuhtli,t Tlapalan,t Tlazolteotl,t Tloque Nahuaque,t Toci,t Tonacacihuatl,t Tonacatecuhtli,t Tonantzin,t Tonatiuh,t Tzitzimime,t Xelhua,t XiIonen,t Xipe,t XiuhtecuhtH,t Xochipilll,t Xo chiquetzal,t Xolotl,t Yacatecutli,t and Zamna.t
Aztlan. In early Aztect myth Aztlan, * the Place of Reeds,’ was given as the country from which the Aztec race started its migration. There is a complete lack of evidence as to where this place might be, but it is possible that it may be linked with Chicomoztoc.t

B
God ‘B.’ This Mayat god, who may be taken to be the rain and thunder god Chac-Mool,+ is found frequently represented in codices and on statues. He is usually represented as carrying an axe and fasces, the normal equipment of the thunder god.
Ba. In Egyptian religion! the external manifestation of the soul which, in the Book of the Dead,! is frequently shown as a manheaded hawk; it might also assume the outward semblance of a flower, a lotus, a serpent, a crocodile, or other object.
Baal. At the time of the Ugarit tablets Baal is already the fertility god of the northern Semites, in eternal conflict with Mot,! the god of death or infertility; he is sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated but always comes to life again. It is probable that he was originally the male consort of the fertility goddess Belet,! whom he gradually displaced. Later the name became equated with ‘Lord’ and was applied to the local god of each town: Baal
Rosh = a lord of the cape, Baal-Shamish = lord of disguise, Baal
Lebanon = lord of Lebanon, Baal-(H)Ammon = the god of Carthage (the Moloch! of the Old Testament and the only member of the Phoenician pantheon whom Philo did not consider to have
been a human being), Baal-Zebub = lord, or owner, of flies. The fact that two sons of Saul, Ishbaal and Mephibal, were so named shows that at that period the word was synonymous with Yahweh. In Babylonia and Assyria the great gods were called ‘Bel,’ the earliest known by this name being Enlil.t The Bel of the Old Testament was probably Marduk,! on whom the title w'as conferred by Tiglath-Pileser I about 1200 b .c. In Egypt, Baal was worshipped during the eighteenth dynasty, after the Syrian wars. Under Rameses II there was a temple of Baal at Tanis. In the Edfu text he was equated with Set.! In his fight with his great enemy, Khoser-et-Hasis,t he was aided by Bod-Baal.t At Emesa he was worshipped as Elagabalus.t
Baalath. A generic name for goddess in the Middle East, frequently applied to the titular deity of a particular town. The Baalath of Byblos was Ashtart.t The word itself means lady or mistress, and would seem to be of greater antiquity than Baal.! Baalath was most frequently applied to Ninlil,! consort of Enlil,! but was also given to the wife of Asshurf or as a variant of Ishtar.t In Egypt she was known as Baelthi.t Alternative spellings are Belitf and Beltis.t To the Canaanites she was Venus, the evening star. 26



Baal Babylonian
Baal Shamain. In Babylonian myth the god of the sky. He has
been identified by Philo with the sun. He may be equated with Shamash.t Baau. Wife of Kolpia.t mother of Aiont and Protogonost in the
Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos. She may be the same as Ba’u.t Babbar. Sun god of Larsa, one of the earliest known members of the Sumerian pantheon. Babylon. In Babylonian myth, Bab-Ilu, or Gate of God. The
Sumerian equivalent w'as Ka Dingir Ra Ki. Babylon was regarded by Muslims as the fountain-head of black magic.
Babylonian Creation Legends. There are three versions of the Babylonian Creation Legend which have come down to us. They are: 1. The story of Berosus (2S0 b.c.). In the beginning there wras an abyss of waters, wherein resided the most hideous beings. This was
ruled over by Thalath—meaning the sea, or equally well the moon.
Belusf came and cut her asunder, and of one half he formed the heavens and of the other half the earth. At the same time he destroyed all the animals within her. To populate the world, Belus commanded Kingut to cut off his head, and from his blood, mixed with earth, were formed men and animals, the sun, the moon and the five planets. 2. The story of Damascius (sixth century ajd.). In the beginning there were Tauthet and Apason,t Tauthe being the mother of the gods. Their first-born was Moymis,t their second and third, Lakhet and Lakhus, their fourth and fifth, Assorust and Kissare,t From these last two came Anu,t Illinus,t and Aus.f To Aus and Daucef
was bom a son Belus,t the fabricator of the world, the Demiurge. 3. The story told in the Creation Tablets in the British Museum, from the library of Ashurbanipal, about 650 b.c. In the beginning there were Apsu,t Mommu,t and Tiamat.t From them sprang two orders of beings, demons and gods. The gods, in order of creation, were Lakhmut and Lakhame; Anshart and Kishar,f and then Anu,t Ea,t and others. Tiamat, being disturbed by the new' gods, consulted with Apsu,
and with Mommu, who appears to have been an intermediary between them. As a result it was decided that the gods must be destroyed. This presumably implies that the country was being invaded by peoples bringing new gods with them, and that the representatives of the old religions were refusing to accept this without war. It was in strict accordance with the principles of Dualismf
that Tiamat and her associates should become the powers of evil,
and Ea the chief of the powers of good.
Ea managed to destroy Apsu by a spell, and Mardukt was bom in 27



Babylonian Babylonian
the place of Apsu. Tiamat called for help from Ummu.Khuburf (or Melilit), who became the mother of the six thousand devils, and from the Eleven Mighty Helpers,t and the whole force was put under the command of Kingut who was given the Dup Shimatit or Tablets of Fate as his seal of authority. The next step was that Ea, becoming frightened at this, consulted Anshar and sent Anu as an emissary to Tiamat, but she looked so angry when he arrived that he fled in terror. The gods held a
council and after much discussion Marduk was put in command of their forces and invested with magical powers. In Assyria Asshurf took the place of Marduk in all these stories. With the aid of these magical spells Kingu was defeated, and the Dup Shimati were taken, and the body of Tiamat was split in half, one half becoming the dome of heaven and the other the wall to contain the waters. Marduk then created man by sacrificing Kingu and using his blood. Afterwards Marduk became the Lord of the Gods and of Men. It appears that the Creation Legends of Babylonia and Assyria are drawn from a source similar to that used by the Hebrews and the Phoenicians and, possibly, the Egyptians. They clearly cannot be memories of the actual creation as such, and may be memories of the emergence of mankind from the effects of some great catastrophe, possibly of a cosmic nature, followed by a flood, and the conflicts between groups of survivors as the effects of the disaster began to disappear. The functions of one of the mother goddesses, whose name may have been Tiamat, Tauthe,t Tohu,t Tamtu,t or Atmu,t were attributed to the flood waters, and, afterwards, when the new gods had been established, the old ones were degraded to the rank of demons, in accordance with the principles of Dualism.t There are two main versions of the Babylonian Deluge Legend, the first of which, taken from the works of Berosus, tells how Xisuthros,t tenth, and last, of the pre-diluvial kings, was warned that there would be a flood by which mankind would be destroyed, and that he should bury all the records of the past at Sippara, and then build a ship into which he could put his family and his friends. The vessel was built and rode the waters of the storm with success. When the flood began to abate Xisuthros sent out birds. The first time they returned, the second time their feet were muddy, and the third time they did not come back. He then found that his ship had stranded on a mountain in Armenia. After building an altar and making a sacrifice Xisuthros vanished, leaving behind instructions for his children. The other and longer version comes from the Gilgamesh Epic,t and is contained on the tablets now in the British Museum. The hero was Uta Napishtimt (in the Sumerian and Akkadian versions he was Ziudsuddu,t but otherwise the stories are much the same), who was
warned by Ea to throw down his house of reeds at Shurippak and 2S



Bacabs Bakairi
build a ship, in which he could house his family. That the vessel was large is shown by references to shipbuilders and a pilot or captain. The flood, when it came, was preceded by violent cyclones, and the waters reached up to the hills, so high that even the goddess Ishtarf was moved to utter a lament to the gods. Eventually the storm ceased and the ship stranded on the mountains of Nisir, where it held fast. On landing Uta Napishtim built an altar, and was later raised to the rank of the gods. It may be taken that the Noachic Deluge Legend was drawn from the same sources as these, but whether for that reason Noah is to be equated with Xisuthros, Uta Napishtim, or Ziudsuddu is by no means certain. The place of landing is variously given as Ararat,! Arnasis,! Baris,t Djudit or Judi,t and Nizir.t The Ark of Noah was said to have been built at a shipyard at Maala, at the foot of the Gebel Shan Sha, near Aden.
Bacabs. The Canopict gods of the Mayas,t who were also the supporters of the four corners of the earth. Their names, their cardinal points, and their symbolic colours were as follows : Mulac,t north, white; Cauac,t south, red; Kan,t east, yellow; Ix,t west, black. They were also minor agricultural gods, and were included among the attendant gods of Chac-Mool,t to whom they bore the same relationship as the Tlalocs of Aztec myth to Tlaloct the rain god.
Badb. A Celtic war goddess subordinate to Morrigu.t In Gaul she was known as Cauth Bodva, the * War Fury.’ She may have been a pre-Celtic goddess who was absorbed by Celtic culture. Her prophecy after Mag Tuireadht is referred to under Celtic Creation Legends.!
Badi. In the Volundar Kvida! he was a giant! who was the father of Volundt and Egil.t
Baduh. A Semitic spirit who ensures the speedy transmission of messages. He is invoked by writing the numerals S, 6, 4, 2, representing the letters in the Arabic alphabet forming his name. This practice was still common in Egypt and Iran in 1945.
Baelthi. Egyptian name for Baalath.f
Bahamut. The enormous fish on which stands Kujata,! the giant bull, whose back supports a rock of ruby, on the top of which stands an angel on whose shoulders rests the earth, according to Islamic myth. Our word Behemoth is of the same origin.
Baltulos. Meaning ‘Abode of God’ in the Phoenician Creation Legend.! The child of Ouranost by Gea,f and brother of Astarte,! Atlas!, Dagont, El,! Pontus,! and Zeus Demaros.!
Bakairi Carib Creation Legend. This is given under Tupuya and Ges Indian Creation Legends.! 29



Bakha Bali
Bakha. In Egyptian myth alternative spelling for Bukhe/f the Bull Bouchis. Bakha is a manifestation of Menthut at Hermonthis.
Bala-Ram(a). In Vedic myth the fair-haired twin brother of Krisna.t He was considered to be an incarnation of Sesha/f the Nagat chief. From this it would appear that both the brothers were related to the Nagas and that Krisna joined the Hindu invaders while Bala-Rama stayed true to his people. Bala-Rama was also worshipped by the ancient Tamils! under the name of Silappadikaram.t Balder. In Nordic myth the son of Odin! and Frigga,! the most beautiful of the Aesir.t His abode, which subsequently became his zodiacal house,! was Breidablik, which corresponds to Gemini, the Twins. Whether this would indicate a possibility of Balder and Hodurf having been twins is not clear, but the possibility should at least be considered. He was the husband of Nannaf and the father of Forseti.! In Balder’s Dream! it is told how, having been troubled with dreams of death, he reported it to the Aesir in council and Frigga! extracted an oath from all things that they would not do any harm to Balder. Loki,! filled with jealousy, ascertained that the mistletoe had not been included in this and persuaded Hodur, who was blind, to throw a sprig at Balder, who immediately fell down dead. Afterwards Hermod,! a son of Odin,! took Sleipnir,! the horse of Odin, and rode to Helat to offer a ransom if she would let Balder return. On arriving at his destination Hela said that Balder could return if ‘ All things in the world, both living and lifeless, weep for him.’ Balder then gave Hermod the ring Draupnirt which had been placed on his funeral pyre to take back to Odin, and Nanna, who had committed suicide after his death, also sent her magic ring to Fulla.t When Hermod returned everything on earth wept for Balder except Thaukt,! and accordingly he did not return. The alternative version of Saxo Grammaticus makes Hodur the rival of Balder for the affections of Nanna. It would seem, however, that this is a later version. After his death his body was placed on a ship, Hringhom,! which was launched with the aid of the giantess Hyrrokin! in strict accordance with northern customs. The fact that Hodur himself was killed some months later may point to Balder having been the divine sacrifice for the saving of the Aesir. The word Balder may be related to the Slavonic Bielbog,! the white god.
Balder’s Dream. An alternative title for the Edda! of the Lay of Vegtam.t
Bali. In Vedic myth a demon resembling Ravana! who is vanquished by Vishnu! as Vamanaf in his fifth or dw’arf avatar. The story appears to be another aspect of the recurrent wars between the Hindus and the Asuras.t 30



Balma Basque
Balma. The wife of Lara,t whose escape from a deluge is told in Celtic Creation Legends.t Balor. In Celtic myth a leader of the Fomorst and the son of
Buarainech. In early "youth one of his eyes had been poisoned and it retained the power of striking people to death by a glance; in consequence four men were needed to raise his eyelid in battle. This sounds very much like a story of some early type of catapult,
which would be confirmed by the fact that at the battle of Mag Tuireadht he was killed by a tathlumt or catapult shot fired by the Tuatha de Danaan.t His daughter Ethnet married Ciant and
became the mother of Lugh.t He may be equated with Bile.t He was the husband of Ceithlenn.t Banaded, or Binded. In Egyptian myth a ram or goat god of the Mendean Triadt of which the other members were Hetmehit and Harpakhrad.t
Banshee. English spelling of the Irish Bean-Sidhe, or fairy woman. Originally it seems to have meant a princess of the Celtic hill people, and its present use to describe a wailing spectre seems to be the result of a mixture of superstition and religious animosity.
Baphomet. The sabbatic goat of the Occultists. The word is said to come from the Greek baphemetons, the appellation of the Pythagorean Pentagon usually found on his head. It is of interest to note that at the trial of the Knights Templars for heresy in 1311 there was only question of a head, said to be that of the Eternal Father at rest, which was stated to come from Gnostics who represented Him as having long hair and a beard, the latter being the beard of truth of the Sephir Dzinioutha. The transformation into a goat’s head may be due either to a misreading of the evidence at the trial by later exponents of the magical art, or by confusion with some god of Semitic origin, brought to Europe from the Middle East by the crusaders.
Barbarossa. In Teutonic myth Frederick I, the red-haired emperor of Germany, rests asleep in a cavern in the Kyffhauser Mountains awaiting the call to arms. For details of similar stories see Sleeping Princes.t
Baris. In Babylonian myth a name given to the landing place of the Ark. The word actually means ship.
Basque Creation Legend. The Basque national epic, Atlantida,t
was put together by Verdaguer in 1S77-S. Unfortunately, although it has been set to music by the Spanish composer, Manuel de Falla, there is no translation available. The story, however, links the Hesperidcs, the Titans, and the loss of the continent of Atlantis to the origin of the Basque race. Other Basque references are given
under Basso-Jaun,t Benzozia,t Maitagarri,f and Orko.t 31



Basso-Jaun Belili
Basso-Jaun. A Basque forest deity living in the deepest part of the forest or in caves.
Bast. Egyptian fire and cat goddess of Bubastis.t She was known as the ‘Little Cat’ or Mau (Mew), as opposed to her sister Sekhmet,t the fire and lioness goddess, who was known as the ‘ Great Cat’ or Mau. Together they destroyed Apept by fire. Both of these goddesses, who are linked with Ptah,t the artificer god, are very ancient. Traces of them in their decadence as the familiars of witches are found in King Lear, where ‘Mahu’ is mentioned, and in Sir John Suckling’s The Goblins, where ‘Mahu’ is the devil. Alternative spellings for Bast are Bubastis and Ubastet.t
Battle of the Trees. In Celtic myth this was fought between Arawn.t the ruler of Annwn.t against Amathaont and Gwydion.t The story is told in Taliesin,t where the battle is given its Welsh name of Cad Goddeu.t
Ba’u. In Babylonian myth a goddess, wife of Ningirsu.t The festival of their sacred marriage came at the end of the harvest, and ensured success for next year’s crops. She gave her name to the first month of the new year, beginning with the autumn equinox. From other calendars of the same period (3000 b.c. or earlier) it is knowm that the festival fell in the month of Tishrit. She may be the same as Baau.t
Baugi. In Nordic myth one of the giantst of the Eddas. He was the brother of Suttungf and it is told in the Conversations of Bragif how Odint tricked him into handing over the secret of the production of Kvasir.t
Beda. In Nordic myth one of the Asynjor,t the women grouped around Freyaf and Frigga.t Begochlddy. In Navajot myth the name given to the great god.
Bel. The Bel of the Old Testament appears to have been the Mardukf of Babylonian myth. He was also Baalt and Belust of Phoenician myth.
Belet. Name of an early northern Semitic fertility goddess, who was gradually displaced by Baal.t It is an alternative spelling for Baalath.t
Beli. British name for the Celtic culture hero Bile,t who may be
equated with Balor.t He was the husband of Donf and the father of Arianrhodt and Caswallawn.t Arianrhod, the wife of Gwydion,t was the same as Ethne,t the wife of Cian.t The family pedigrees are compared under Lleu.t
Belial. Hebrew expression for worthlessness (Beliy Ya’al), meaning the underworld, or the devil.
Belili. Sumerian moon goddess, also goddess of trees, love, and 32



Beowulf
Belisma
the underworld ; she was very ancient and preceded Ishtar.t She
was the sister and wife of Tammuz.t Beli, the Slavonic name for
white, is connected with her, while the word billet (of wood) may come from her as a tree goddess. She was eventually superseded by Bel.t
Belisma. A Celtic lakef or river priestess. Ptolemy gives her name to the Kibble, but inscriptions of it have been found in Gaul.
Belit. In Babylonian myth an alternative spelling for Baalath.f
Beltaine. The Celtic feast of the spring equinox, held at the beginning of May, the other feasts being Lugnasad,t Oimelc,t and Samhain.t The ‘taine’ means fire and may be related to Tin,t the Etruscan fire god, while the ‘ bel ’ may be Bile,f the ruler of the Celtic underworld. In Ireland this festival was also known as Samradh or Cetsamain, and in Wales it was Cyntefyn.
Beltis. Alternative spelling for Baalatht in Babylonian myth.
Belus. Son of Aust and Daucet in the Babylonian Creation Legendt of Damascius. He is the same as Bel.t
Benani. In Babylonian myth he was the father by Melilit of the warriors with the bodies of birds and the men with the faces of ravens created by the old gods. These monsters numbered six thousand, had seven kings, and corresponded to the legion created by Tiamatt for her fight with Marduk.t
Bendigeidfran. Full-length rendering of the name of Brand
Bennu. The sacred bird of the Egyptians which periodically was re-created by flame, a story which came to western Europe as that of the phoenix. As an emblem of the resurrection it was sacred to Osiris,t but was also known as the head of Rat ‘Tep-rabennu,’ which may have been the original wording of Taprobana, early name for Ceylon. The hieroglyph of the Bennu was ‘Bah Balm,’ meaning to flood or to water, followed by three parallel wave lines, the water symbol, indicating a link with a flood legend. Further details under Egyptian Creation Legend,t Anqa,t Phoenix,

Benten. Japanese goddess of the sea who resembles Kwannon,t but who was mainly worshipped on the outlying islands. Her shrine was at Enoshimi, where she was said to have captivated and married a dragon which was devouring children of the neighbourhood. She was one of the seven divinities of luck, the Shichi Fukujin.t
Benzozia. A mother goddess of the Basque people.
Beowulf. The song of Beowulf is mainly concerned with the adventures of a historic king of the Geats, and as such cannot be considered as myth. However, there is a king of a similar name who is mentioned in various king lists as haring lived before Odint or
Wodent and it is possible that the dragon-slaying episode of the poem 33



Berecyntia Bhrigu
Beowulf belonged to this individual. In the poem is mentioned Sigmundt as slayer of another dragon, and also Sinfjotli,t thereby linking this story with the Nibelungenlied.
Berecyntia. A goddess of the Gauls, probably the same as Brigit.t
Bergelmir. In the Nordic Creation Legends.t as told in the Vafthrudnismal,t he and his wife w’ere the sole survivors of a deluge which came from the blood of Ymir.t They escaped in a boat and all the other members of the Hrim-thursarf or ice giants were drowned. Berouth. In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos he was one of the first gods. He was parent with Eliounf of Geat and Ouranos.t Bes. This bandy-legged dwarf demigod of Egypt wus the god of music and pleasure. He may have been a god of birth, as we hear of him as a protector of children. He seems to have been of
Babylonian origin and to have been akin to Gilgamesh.t He appeared in Egypt in the eighteenth dynasty as a war god and a god of fashion. Later he seems to have passed into Greek iconography as Silenus, the satyr.
Besla, Bestla. A giantess, daughter of Bolthom,t wife of Borf and mother of Odin,t the Nordic culture hero.
Bevarash. In Zoroastrian myth the last of the dynasty of the Azidahaka,t the serpent-worshipping kings of Media. He was overthrown by Faridut and condemned to be bound to Mount Demavand. He has been equated with the Astyages who wus overthrown by Cyrus.
Bhadra Vira. In Vedic myth a title under which Sivat was worshipped in the Maratha country. He is represented as armed with sword, spear, shield, bow and arrow, with the sun and moon, mounted on Nandi,t and with the goat-headed Dakshat by his side.
Bhaga. In Vedic myth one of the twelve Adityast or guardians of the months of the year. In the dispute between Sivat and Daksha,t Bhaga was blinded by Virabhadra,t a monster created by Siva.

Bhima. In Vedic myth the child of Vayu.t
Bhrigu. In Vedic myth one of the seven great Rishist or Prajapatis.f He was known as ‘ the Calm-souled.’ It was Matarisvan,t the messenger of the gods, who brought Agnif to Bhrigu. 34



B-Iame Bishamon
B-Iame. A supreme being of the Australian tribes of a class with Bun-Jil,t Daramulum/f Mungan-Ngana/f Nurelli,f Nurrundere,t etc. It is considered by some that although the aborigines could not be said to have any conscious form of religion their beliefs might, under favourable conditions, have developed into a worship of B-Iame. On the other hand it is equally probable that the confusion of
aboriginal belief may have resulted from the degeneration of an organized religion under the impact of difficult conditions. B-Iame was opposed by Darawigal,f the force of evil.
Blelbog. In Slavonict myth he was the white god, similar to Byelunt, or the power of good as opposed to Czarnobog,t the black god, or power of evil; a conception of Dualismt which may be traced back to ancient Persia. The word may be related to the name of Balder.t
Bifrost. In Nordic myth the rainbow bridge leading from the world to Asgard,t In the Ragnarolct it is told how it was broken down by the onrush of the sons of Muspellt led by Surtur.t
Bil. In Nordic myth a minor Norse goddess and one of the Asynjor.f She may perhaps be the Jill of the nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill who went up a hill to fetch a pail of water. The version in the Prose Eddat is that Bil and Hjuki were returning from the spring with a bucket of water when they were seized by Mani,t the moon god, and aftenvards they always followed the moon as could be seen from the earth. This postulates the former existence of a pair of asteroids between the earth and the moon which have long since vanished.
Bile. In Celtic myth an alternative name for Beli,t used in this capacity as ruler of the underworld. He appears to have been the same as Balor.t He is confused with another individual of a similar name who was the brother of Itht and the father of Mile, leader of the Milesiant invasion of Ireland. Comparative family trees of Beli,t Bile, and Balor are given under Lleu.t His festival was that of Beltaine.t
Bimbo-Gami. Japanese god of poverty.
Binded. In Egyptian myth an alternative spelling for Banaded.t
Binzuku. Japanese disciple of Buddha who was raised to the rank of god on account of his miraculous powers of healing the sick.
Birral. Early culture hero of the Herbert River tribes who may be linked with Maambaf and Kohint (also known as Koint).
Bishamon. Japanese god of war depicted as wearing armour and carrying a spear and a miniature pagoda. He is one of the seven divinities of luck, the Shichi Fukujin.t He is also one of the guardians of the cardinal points. He was the guardian of the north.

Bith Blue-Jay
Bith and Birren. The Adam and Eve of a Deluge story told in Celtic Creation Legends.t
Blackfoot Indian Creation Legend. This tribe of North American Indians have a legend that at the time of the great catastrophe their ancestors took refuge in a great cave named Nina Stahu.t from which they were led by Napi,t the founder of the tribe. They had a morning Venus god named Apisirahtst and a moon goddess called Komorkis.t Black Magic. At the present day means the use of ritual magic for personal gain or lust, and usually has a strong element of sexuality in it. Earlier it could have been defined as any religious practice appertaining to a superseded or unpopular religion which has not been incorporated in the dogma of an existing and dominating religion. The majority of the practices falling under tin’s heading are to be traced back to the pre-Judaic period in the Middle East, and are vestiges of still earlier ceremonies. The name itself constitutes a recognition of the dualistict principle of the offsetting of good by evil, which has formed the backbone of many religions, including some Christian heresies. The original definition is ritual practised for harmful purposes, to produce sterility, sickness, or death. While the various phenomena grouped under this designation are frequently difficult to explain by ordinary methods, there would appear to be no reason for describing them as other than ‘ of the earth, earthy.’ Blathnat. In Celtic myth she was the daughter of Mider,t the king of the Gaelic underworld. She helped Cuchulainnt steal her father’s magic cauldront from her husband Curoiyf who was its guardian. Blodeuwedd. In Celtic myth she was ‘Flower Face,’ the wife of Lleu,t who conspired with Gronw Pebyrt to kill him. As a punishment she was either changed into an owl or killed by Gwydion,t the father of Lieu. She was buried under Craig y Dinas where Arthurf
is supposed by some to sleep. To some extent she may be equated with Olwen.f Blue-Jay. A figure in the Creation Legend of the Chinookst who
resembles in character the Coyotet of the Californian Indians. He was originally a mischief-making individual who was eventually turned into a zoomorphic being by the gods. This may be a posthumous development. There is a trilogy of stories about BlueJay and his sister Ioif which resemble to some extent the initiation ceremonies described in the Popul Vuh.t The stories tell how Ioi, Blue-Jay’s sister, begs him to take a wife to share her labour. He takes the corpse of a chief’s daughter from her grave, and carries her to the land of the Supernatural People, who restore her to life. The chief her father finds this out, and demands Blue-Jay’s hair as a 36

recompense, but Blue-Jay changes himself into his bird shape and flies away. His wife dies again. The dead in the land of the Supernatural Folk then purchase Ioi his sister for a wife, and he sets off in search of her. He finds her surrounded by heaps of bones, to whom she alludes as her relations by marriage. The ghosts resume their human shape but on being addressed by Blue-Jay become heaps of bones once more, and he takes a mischievous delight in reducing them to this condition and in mixing up the various heaps of bones, so that the ghosts find they have the wrong heads, legs, and arms when they materialize again. He is also involved in the story of Aqas-Xena-Xenas.t
Bn-Ym. The son of the sea in the Ugarit texts. He was also known as Khoser-et-Hasis.f
Bo. A god of the Ewe peoples of Dahomey. He was the protector of persons engaged in war and was linked with a god Khebiesot or Sot who was the lightning. The priests of Bo carried with them on ceremonial occasions a peculiar axe made of brass and also bundles of sticks from four to six feet long painted red and white. As with the ancient Romans the axe was the symbol of thunder and the fasces, or sticks, that of lightning.
Boann. In Celtic myth a queen of Ireland, the wife of Dagdat and the mother of Angus.t Her name was given to the River Boyne and is linked with a flood myth given in Celtic Creation Legends.t It is probable that she was the titular priestess of the source of the river, where it is said there lived the salmon of knowledge which fed on nuts dropped from the nine hazel-trees at the water’s edge. This sounds very much like the magic cauldront of Annwnt which was tended by nine maidens.
Boars. Sacred boars are listed under Treasures.! The boars of Freyt are given under that heading.
Boat of the Soul. A vehicle used in Chinese! royal funerals together with the Chariot of the Soul and the Tablet of the Soul, the latter being a piece of thick flat wood five times as long as it is wide, on which the name of the deceased was inscribed. This custom may date back to a time when the Chinese were a maritime nation and buried their chiefs in boats.
Bochica. Culture hero of the Muyscayast of Columbia. He brought to them knowledge of building, agriculture, use of a calendar, and a legal code. On his death he handed over the govern
ment of the tribe to four chiefs. He is sometimes referred to as Suaf or Nemquetchaf but these are possibly later-date mistakes in identity. After his death he became a dawn or morning Venus god. Subse
quent generations recounted how he carried the world on his shoulders and that when he eased Iris position there were

Bocor Book
earthquakes, from which it may be deduced that he lived at a time of great natural disasters.
Bocor. Title of the professional sorcerer of the voodoot worshippers of Haiti. The practice of voodoo worship in Haiti resembles
that of the fetisht worshippers in Dahomey from whom it appears to have evolved. The slight modifications introduced by local custom and the advent of Christianity do not appear to have brought any great change. In both cases the religious practices appear to be the degenerate remains of an early and somewhat complicated African ritual.
Bodb. The Red, a son of Dagdayt who succeeded his father as king of the Tuatha de Danann.t
Bod-Baal. In the Ugarit texts he was one of the aids of Baalt in his combat with Khoserf and with Zabel,t the Lord of the Sea, and the Suffetet of the River, on whom he pounces like an eagle.
Bodvild. In Nordic myth the daughter of King Nithud,t who was seduced by Volundt in revenge for his ill treatment at the hands of her father.
Bog. A generic term for God in the Slavbnict languages. It comes from the Persian bagi, and the Sanskrit bhaga, implying richness and power.
Bolthorn. A northern giant, father of Besla,t the wife of Bor,t and grandfather of Odin.t
Book of the Dead. See also Egyptian Creation Legendst and Egyptian Religion.t An aspect of early religious thought peculiar to the Egyptians was the custom of furnishing the dead with detailed instructions, with the aid of which they could overcome all difficulties on their way to the Elysian Fields, the Sekhet Aarut (see Sad Elf). At first these instructions were painted on the inner walls of pyramids and on sarcophagi and coffins, being known as pyramid texts, but by the eighteenth dynasty the formulae had become so large that it became necessary to put them on papyrus rolls, extant copies of which range berween 50 and 135 feet in length. The Arab
tomb robbers called these rolls ‘Kitab al Mayit, ’ meaning ‘Book of the Dead Man,’ a name which is now generally applied to them. The earliest texts were taken from the Pertemhru or ‘Coming forth by Day,’ which seems to have been evolved in the earliest dynastic or even pre-dynastic period. Although it was in use for over three thousand years, nothing appears to have been taken from it, the only changes being in the nature of increases. There were three main recensions, at Heliopolis, Thebes, and Sais, differing mainly in the naming of Amont Ra or Osirist as chief god. These 38



Bor Bouyan
collations of prayers, religious texts, magical spells, hymns, evocations, and detailed instructions faithfully reflected the religious feeling of their time, but with the general decline in Egyptian religion the meaning of many of the texts had obviously been for
gotten. The author of the Pertemhru was generally assumed to be Thothjt the scribe of the Ennead,t the Great Company of the Gods, and the recording angel of paradise, and it was upon his advocacy that the Egyptian counted for the securing of his acquittal on the Day of Judgment, so that he might enjoy the fruits of a virtuous life. The underlying assumption of the whole work, as was the case for the whole religion of Osiris, was that the dead came up for moral judgment, before a tribunal of the gods. The accused entered the antechamber, and repeated an affirmation of Iris good conduct during life, and was then admitted for trial before Osiris. Near him were the scales, watched over by Anubis,t and in a state of expectant waiting was Ament,t the devourer of the hearts of the wicked. After addressing the assembled gods, the heart of the accused was weighed by Thoth balanced against the Maatf or feather of truth. If the balance was exact the heart became as the heart of Osiris, and he was admitted into the other world, or Amenti,t the Land of the West, as a Sahuf or spirit body.
Bor. In Nordic myth, son of Burf and father, by the giantess Besla,t of Odin,t Wili,t and We,t the slayers of Ymir,t the first of the frost giantsf or Jotunns.t
Bormanus. An early god of the continental Celts.
Borve. In Celtic myth a king who was involved in the dispute between Llyrt and his second wife Aeife, who turned the children of his first wife into swans. For this act she was changed by King Borve into a demon. There is a Borvot who was a deity of the continental Celts associated with hot springs who may possibly be the same person.
Borvo. A god of hot springs associated with the continental Celts, equated by the Romans with Apollo. He seems to have arisen as the son of an earlier goddess Sironat or Dirona.t The word borvo means to boil.
Bouto. Greek name for Uadjit,t the Egyptian serpent goddess.
Bouyan. An island paradise of the Slavs. On it was the sacred stone Alatuiryt from beneath which flowed a river whose waters healed all ailments. Here dwelt the king of the snakes and Zaryat the beautiful priestess. It resembles Falias,t the City of the North of Celtic myth, from whence came the Stone of Destiny, and seems to indicate an intermingling of Slavonic and Celtic myth at some early stage. Bouyan also resembles Muriast in being the City beneath the
39



Bragi Bran
Waters. Even after the revolution Bouyan continued to occupy an important place in Slavonic! myth, and is akin to Raj.!
Bragi. In Nordic myth one of the Aesirt and husband of Iduna.t In the Braga Raedur, or ‘Conversations of Bragi/ one of the Eddas,! he tells Aegirf the stories of Idunat and her apples; of the peace treaties between the Aesir and the Vanirf sealed by spitting in Odherir,! the magic cauldron ; of the murder of Kvasirf by the dwarfst; of the liquor of poetic inspiration brewed by the giant Suttungt from the fermented blood of Kvasir, and how Odint steals the recipe by seducing Gunnlauth.t
Brahma. In later Vedic myth the senior god of the Great
Triad with Vishnut and Siva.f He was said to be bom from the golden egg called Narayana,! which floated on the waters. He divided himself into two halves, a male half called Purusha,! and a female half called Satarupa.t In view of the fact that Purusha is also described as a primeval giant from whose dead body the world was created, it would seem possible that at some very early stage Satarupa may have been the mother goddess from whom Brahma developed. The whole conception of Brahma as the universal allpervading deity appears to have arisen comparatively late in the structure of Vedic religion, and to be rather a theological concept than an expression of popular opinion. Other details are given under Hindu Creation Legends.! The Matsyaf and Kurmat and Varahat avatarst of Vishnu have also been attributed to Brahma. The Kalpa,! or Day of Brahma, was supposed to cover the entire period from the creation of the universe to its final destruction. Brahma is represented as red or gold coloured, robed in white, and seated on a swan. He has four heads and four arms. In his hands he holds a rosary, a vessel containing Ganges water, a portion of the Vedas, and a sceptre. His city is Brahmapurat on the summit of Mount Meru. Although Brahma is the most familiar name in the Hindu pantheon, he has receded so far into the background as to be almost outside the field of popular worship.
Brahmanaspati. In late Vedic myth the lord of prayer. This purely abstract deity appears to have arisen as part of the general polytheistic tendencies of Brahmanism. In the Mahabharatat he was the parent of Agni.t
Brahmapura. In Vedic myth the city of Brahma,! situated on the summit of Mount Meru.!
Bran. Hypocoristic form of Bendigeidfran.! In Celtic myth he was the son of Llyrt by Iweriddt and was the brother of Branwen.t After his sister had married Matholwch,! the King of Ireland, her husband’s continued ill treatment of her forced Bran to invade Ireland and he was killed in a battle, only seven of his followers

Branwen Brisingamen
surviving: Pryderi/f Manawyddan,t Glunent son of Taran/f Taliesin,!
Ynawc, Grudyen the son of Muryel, and Heilyn the son of Gwynn the ancient. After the death of Bran, his head was cut off and carried by the seven to Tower Hill in London, where it was buried. During the Irish wars Caswallawnt had seized the kingdom of Britain. The head of Bran, which was known as Uther Ben
meaning the Wonderful Head—remained buried until dug up by King Arthur, a deed which was called one of the ‘three wicked uncoverings of Britain.’ Bran himself appears in subsequent myth under many names, such as Brandegore, Sir Brandel, Ban of Behvik Lcodegrance.t He originally appears to have been a king of a crow or raven totem clan and the legendary assumption that he was mythical king of the underworld appears to be unjustified.
Branwen. In Celtic myth the daughter of Llyrf by Iweridd.t She was one of the three matriarchs of Britain and became the wife of Matholwch,t the King of Ireland, and had one son, Gwem.t Her continued ill treatment by her husband caused her brother Bran,t the King of England, to invade Ireland and kill her husband with most of the Irish nobility. Her son was murdered by Evnisien,t her stepbrother.
Bregon. In Celtic myth the father of Bileyt a leader of the Milesians.t He was also the father of Ith.t
Bress. In Celtic myth the son of Elthan,t chief of the Fomors,t and the most beautiful being in Ireland. After the deposition of Nudat he was made king of the Tuatha de Danannt as a move towards peace between the two nations. He was a most unpopular king and eventually was himself deposed in favour of Nuda, after he had fallen ill following a magical satire written about him by Caipre.t
Brian. In Celtic myth one of the three sons of Tuirennt the murderers of Ciant who, as a penalty, had to seek and find what subsequently became the treasures of the Tuatha de Danann.t His brothers were Iuchairt and Iucharbar.
Briganta. Goddess of the Brigantes; she was a northern Celtic variant of Brigit.t
Brigindo. Name given to Brigitt by the Celts of eastern France.
Brigit. The Celtic goddess of fire, of the hearth, and of poetry,
who was also known as Berecyntia,t Briganta,t and Brigindo.f With the advent of Christianity she became St. Brigit or Brigid. She was said to be the daughter of Dagdat and dates back to the earliest periods of Irish history.
Brisingamen. In Nordic myth the fiery necklace of Freya,t which she broke in her fury on hearing that the giant Thrymt had demanded
her hand as a reward for the return of the hammer of Thor.t Later



Buddha
Brownie
Freya lent the necklace to Thor, who disguised himself as the bride
and went in her stead. Other details of the story will be found under
Thrym. The tale that the necklace was made by the dwarfs,t and
that it was only by surrendering herself to four of them that Freya
obtained it, seems to refer to some dispute between the mother goddess and the dwarfs settled by payment of a necklace. In the same manner Odin’st bribing of Lokit to steal it must relate to a
dispute between the invading Aesirt and the goddess. To recover it Heimdalt fought Loki daily until he killed liim at Ragnarok.f It is possible that the necklace was a magic one as an enchantress of the name of Brisin is mentioned in the Arthurian legends. In Scaldic literature it is called Sviagris.
Brownie. A kindly Scottish goblin similar to the elvest and the koboldst of continental tradition. There was an altar to a brownie in Scotland until recently, from which one may conclude that he was a pre-Celtic god who had been degraded by time. To some extent he resembles the Fenodryee,t or the Cornish pisky.t
Brynhild, Brunhild. In the Volsung Cycle! a Valkyrie! who is awakened from a charmed sleep by Sigurd,! to whom she becomes betrothed. Later, Sigurd, having lost his memory, impersonates Gunnarf to enable him to win Brynhild. To do this he rides through a wall of flame (initiation ceremony!), as in the case of Menglad! and Skimir.t When Brynhild discovers the treachery of which she has been the victim, she turns against Sigurd, and has him killed and then takes her own life. In the Thidrek Saga,! her betrothed Siegfried! marries Grimhild, for reasons of policy. The rest of the story is similar to the above. In the Nibelungenlied she is a queen of Iceland, who can only be wed by one who could defeat her in three trials of strength. Siegfried, her betrothed, wearing the Tamkappe,! the helmet of invisibility, defeats her, thus enabling Gunther! to wed her. Because of this she has Siegfried murdered by Hagen.!
Bubastis. Greek name for Bast,! the Egyptian cat goddess.
Buddha. Gautama Buddha, to whom in the western world the name Buddha is usually applied, was according to the traditions of the faith the twenty-fifth in order of a series of great religious leaders who preached the gospel to mankind. On each occasion,
however, men forgot the truth and fell away into ignorance and sin, and a new Buddha arose. Gautama was born about 560 b.c. to a princely family of the Sakyas, rulers of portions of Oudh and Nepal. Before his birth his mother Maya dreamt she beheld the future
Buddha descending from heaven and entering her womb in the form of a white elephant, for which reason the elephant is a sacred animal to Buddhists. At the time of his birth earthquakes and miracles of healing took place, flowers bloomed out of season, and heavenly music 42



Buddhist Bun-Jil
was heard. It was prophesied that at the age of thirty-five he would
become a Buddha, after seeing the four signs: a decrepit man, a sick man, a dead man, and a monk.
In spite of precautions the four signs were manifested and Gautama, at the age of twenty-nine, abandoned his princely life, his wife, and his son, and proceeded to a life of six years of austerities, after which he sat alone under the sacred Bo Tree, and after a successful battle with Mara,t the tempter, he became a Buddha, the Enlightened One. After forty-five years spent in teaching the Buddha died at the age of eighty. The religious system which he initiated spread to Tibet, China, and Japan, where it still survives, although in India itself it has largely been displaced by Brahmanism and Islam. The doctrine of the Noble Eightfold Path, sometimes called the Middle Path because it avoids both bodily indulgence and asceticism, has been made known to the western world largely through the activities of the Thcosophical Society and kindred bodies. The adoption in Vedic religion of Buddha as the ninth avatarf of Vishnut was due to the necessity for some compromise between the two faiths.
Buddhist Creation Legend. According to Buddhist myth our universe is divided into three regions: Kama Loka, the world of desire; Rupa Loka, the world of form; and Arupa Loka, the world of the spirit. In Tibetan Buddhism there is yet another region above the Arupa Loka, that of the Five Celestial Ginas or Dhyani Buddhas, crowned by the realm of Adi Buddha, the primeval Buddha. The
Kama Loka is divided into six regions, beginning with that of the four maharajas, the guardians of the four cardinal points, situated on the top of Mount Merut; the Trayastrimska, the abode of Indrat and of the thirty-three subordinate divinities; the kingdom of Yama,t the realm of the dead; Tushita, the home of the Boddhisattvas; the Nirmanarati, the abode of the creative gods, and at the top, Paranirmita-Vasavartin, the abode of Mara,t the great tempter. Below this and still forming part of the Kama Loka are, in descending order, the world of men, that of the Asuras,t that of animals, that of ghosts, and at the very bottom the various hells. For further details see Buddha,t Hsi-Yu-Chi,t Karma,t ICuanYin,t Nirvana,t Sakyamuni,t Sun-Houtzu,f and Tripitaka.t The Japanese Buddhist deities were Amida,t Binzuru,t Dainichi,t

Bur Byelun
Australia. He is said by the first to have made men of day and endowed them with life, and by the second to have taught them the art of life. Later he ascended to the sky land. In the Murray River and Victoria districts he is known as Pun-Gel.t He is of a similar type to B-Iame,t Daramulum,t Mungan-Ngana,t Nurelli,t and Nurrundere.t Bur. In the Nordic creation mytht he was the first man, the father of Bort and the grandfather of Odin.t
Buriash. Kassite god of storm, corresponding to Adadt and Teshub.t Burmese Myth. See Hmin/f the demon of ague.
Bushes, Sacred. The Lithuanians worshipped sacred bushes, a practice which appears to have been similar to the worship of Djin,t the woodland spirits of Albania and Serbia.
Bushmen Creation Legends. The bushmen of South Africa believe that in the beginning men and animals were endowed with speech. There existed a quarrelsome being named Hochiganf who hated animals; he eventually disappeared, but with his departure the animals lost the power of speech. They also believe in a being as mischievous and full of tricks as the Coyotet of North America; his representative on earth is the praying mantis. He is named Kaggen,t or, alternatively, Cagn.t
Bussumarus. A god of the continental Celts, whom the Romans identified with Jupiter. The name signifies ‘the large-lipped.’
Byelun. A Slavonic! deity similar to Bielbog,t the name meaning ‘the white one.’

He is the same as Zotzilaha Chimalman,t the bat god of the Mayas.
Camu. A culture hero of the Arovacsf who in all probability corresponds to the Kamut or Tamut of the Caribs.t
Camulos. In Celtic myth a king of the Tuatha de Danannt who has been fused with some early heaven god. It is possible that he
may have been the Cumhal, the king warrior who wras the father of Finn! and original King CoIe,t hero of nursery rhyme.
Canopic Jars. In the process of embalming as practised in Egypt, the intestines and other internal organs were removed, cleaned, wrapped in linen with powdered spices, etc., and placed in jars named Canopic Jars. The name is said to have arisen from the old legend whereby Canopus, the pilot of Menelaus, w'as buried at Canopus, and there worshipped in the shape of a jar with small feet, thin neck, swollen body, and a round back. As far back as the sixth dynasty these jars were dedicated to the four cardinal points, and

from about the seventeenth dynasty they bore the heads of the four sons of Horust (or of Osirist): Amset/f Hapi,t Duamutef,t .and Qebhsneuf,t who also became gods of the cardinal points, protecting the liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines respectively. Traces of a similar custom have been observed in the Americas. For details see Bacabs.t Carib Creation Legend. This now extinct tribe of the Antilles had a myth that after the Deluge the founder of the race created
mankind by sowing stones in the soil from which sprang men and
women. Their earth mother goddess was called Mama Nono.t

Celtic Cesara
Celtic Creation Legends, i. An Irish myth tells how Bith,t his wife Birrcn, their daughter Cesarat and her husband Fintaan,t their son Larat with his wife Balmayf escaped to Inisfail in a ship, at the time of the Deluge. Later there was a large red moon, with bright expanding clouds breaking up into hundreds of pieces, and the whole family were killed, leaving the land uninhabited. Another legend tells that a woman had a magic cask which, when opened, flowed for so long that the water covered the earth. Boannyf the wife of Dagda,t is also linked with a Flood myth, concerning the
overflowing of the Boyne. Badbt prophesied after Mag Tuireadht that there would be a disaster involving the gods similar to Ragnarok.t 2. In Wales, the Deluge myth tells of the overflowing of LlyonLlion,t from which Dwyvant and Dwyvacht alone escaped. There is a Druid myth telling how fire and water prevailed over the earth.
Cenn Cruaich. In Celtic myth ‘the Lord of the Mound' to whom firstlings were sacrificed in Ireland. His effigy was stated to have been of gold surrounded by twelve stones.
Cephalonia. The Lost Island, so called because only by chance even those who had been there were able to find it again.
Cerldwen. An early British fertility goddess mentioned in the Mabinogion. She was the possessor of a magic cauldron called Amen.t She was the wife of Tegidt and had three children, of which Creirwyt was the most beautiful girl and Avagdut the ugliest boy. To compensate him for this she prepared a magic draught made from
six plants and named ‘greal’—which has some affinity with the
Graiit—and which when drunk was to give inspiration and science.
The process of making took a year and a day, and Gwiont was ordered to stir it when three drops splashed from the cauldron named Ament on to his fingers, and on his sucking them to stop the pain he suddenly became possessed of all knowledge. The liquor resembled the Kvasirf of the northern races. Ceridwen on discovering what had happened pursued Gwion.
He changed into a hare and she became a greyhound; he became a fish, she became an otter; he became a bird, she became a hawk; he became a grain of com, she became a hen, and ate him. Later she gave birth to a child who became Taliesin,t the most famous of the Welsh bards. The myth resembles various initiation ceremonies,
and may well relate to the rites connected with the appointment of a bard or Druid.
Cermait. The Honey-mouthed, a name given to Ogma,t the
Celtic god of literature.
Cesara, Cessalr. In Celtic myth the daughter of Bitht and Birren,
who escaped with her husband Fintaant in a ship to Inisfail (Ireland) at the time of the Deluge. The story, which is detailed in Celtic

Chac-Mool. A rain and thunder god of the Mayast who became a personification of the four Bacabst whose personal names were Kan,t Cauac,t Mulac,t and Ix,t words meaning yellow, red, white, and black. He appears to be the God ‘B’t of Schellhas. It is possible that he may be a later development of Chalchihuitlicue,t the Mexican rain and water goddess. He was the deity of the east.
Chalchihuitlicue. Aztect water goddess, the wife of Tlaloc,t and known as ‘the Emerald Lady.’ There may be some connection between her and Xochiqeutzalt as in one instance she is referred to as ‘ Macuilxochiquetzalli,’ meaning ‘ Five Times Flower Feather.’ She was the lordt of the third hour of the day and the sixth hour of the night.

Chandra. In Vedic myth one of the eight Vasus,t the divine attendants of Indra.t The word means moon, and is probably the name of some pre-Vedic moon god.

There was a lunar zodiac of 27 asterisms.

Chla. Moon goddess of the Muyscayat Indians. In their creation myth she was once supposed to have flooded the whole
world. She was pre-eminently a goddess of women, and if a man fell

Chicomecoatl. Aztect maize goddess dating from Middle Culture times known as ‘Seven Snakes.’ She was probably of Toltec origin and has been equated with Tonacacihuatl.t
Ckicomoztoc. In the Aztect Creation Legend the first of their race emerged from Chicomoztoc, the Cavern of the Seven Chambers, the place of refuge of the race during some period of natural disaster, possibly situated in Aztlanf or alternatively somewhere to the north of Mexico. In the first case this would fit in with the story of their departure by boat for Mexico, bringing with them their chief god Huitzilopochtli.t Whether the seven cities of Cibolat can be integrated into this picture is not clear. It seems possible that Mictlan,t the Aztec Hades, was derived from this, while the TulanZuivat of the Quichesf may well be the same place.
Children of Don. In British Celtic myth the equivalent of the Tuatha de Danann.t
Chimalmat. In the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the Popul Vuht she was the wife of Vukub-Cakix,t a giant,t and the mother of two sons, Earth Heaper and Earthquake.

From these arose Pan-Ku,! a giant,t from whose body the world and our solar system were composed. Shang-Tit and Tien,t the heaven gods, appear to have been imported from northern China about 2000 B.c. Their relationship to the Creation is purely abstract. The Deluge myth of Kung

Chinvat Peretu. In Zoroastrian myth the bridge over the abyss which the souls of the dead had to cross, For the good it was broad and pleasant; for the wicked it was narrow and impassable: with the result that they fell into the clutches of the demons waiting beneath.

The name means * Doctrine of the Mean’ ; it is in fact chapter xxxi of the Li-Kit and with its commentary is regarded as the most complete account of Confucian philosophy, and is said to have been done by the grandson of the Master himself. The preceding work is the Ta-Hsucht and the following work is the Meng-Tsze.t
Chun-Tsiu. The fourth of the nine authoritative works on Confucianism.f The name means ‘Spring and Autumn,’ and the work itself, which is a history of the Chinese state of Lu from 772 b.c. to 484 b.c., is usually regarded as having been written by Confucius himself. The style, however, is rather that of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a sequence of factual statements of events. The preceding work is the Shi-King,-f the following work is the Li-Ki.t Churning of the Ocean. In Vedic myth the Churning of the Ocean, which is described under Kurina,t is a peculiar mixture of a 50

Deluge legend, a cosmic disaster, an early sea battle with the Asuras,t and the treasures which the Vedic tribes had as their legendary heritage.
Cian. In Celtic myth the son of Dianchecht/f the husband of Ethnct and the father of Lugh,t the leader of the Tuatha de
Danannt against the Fomors.t He was murdered by the three sons
of Tuirenn,t and as a penance they had to bring to Lugh the eight wonders of the Celtic world, which became the treasurest of the Tuatha. He may be equated with MacKinely.t Comparative pedigrees arc given under Lleu.t
Cibola, The Seven Cities of. Legendary cities from which the first Aztccst originated. It is possible these may be the same as Chicomoztoc.t
Cihuacoatl. Aztect mother goddess ruling over childbirth known as ‘Serpent Woman.’ She was also styled Tonantzin,t meaning * Our Mother.’ She was the mother of Mixcoatl.t
Cihuateteo. In Aztect myth these goddesses were the spirits of women who had died in childbirth and who lurked at cross-roads inflicting evil on passers by. Originally they would appear to have been priestesses of one or other of the fertility cults whose transformation into forces of evil may have taken place at the time of some religious change.
Cinteotl. Aztect maize god, the son of Tlazolteotlt and the husband of Xochiquetzal.t He is probably the same as the Mayan God ‘E.’t In his earlier stages he may have been a maize goddess. He was the lordt of the fourth hour of the night.
Citlallinicue. ‘Star Garment.’ Secondary name of Ilamatecuhtli,t ancient Aztect fertility goddess.
Cluricane. In Celtic myth an Irish elft of evil disposition, noted for his knowledge of hidden treasure; he generally assumed the appearance of a wrinkled old man. He was probably a debased god of pre-Celtic, even of Mediterranean, origin, and as such a cousin of the Dulachant rather than of the Fenodyree.t
Coatlicue. Aztect earth goddess known as ‘Serpent Skirt’ who was associated with spring sowing festivals. She was the mother by Mixcoatlt of Huitzilopochtli,t the Aztec god of war.

Conanche Coyote
Conanche Indian Creation Legend. The myth of this tribe is found under Shoshoneant Indian Creation Legend.
Conchobar. In Celtic myth he was the child of Fathacht and Nessat and the brother of Dechtere.t On the death of his father his mother persuaded the then King of Ulster, Fergus,t to allow her son to occupy the throne for a year, at the end of which time the nobles refused to allow Fergus to return. Conchobar married first Medb,t and after she had left him for Ailillt he married her sister Eithne.f He appears to have been a wise and successful king. The story of Deirdref and Naoise,t one of the most tragic of the Celtic love stories, is intimately linked with him.
Confucianism. The doctrines of Confucianism are expressed in nine books: Yih-King,t Shu-King,t Shi-King,t Chun-Tsiu,t Li-ICi,t Lun-Yu,t Ta-Hsuch,t Chung-Yung,t and Meng-Tsze.f Confucius himself was mainly a political and social reformer and his doctrines are in the main rather a system of ethics than a religion. The actual name of Confucius was Kung-Fu-Tsze. As was the case with Taoism,t the ancient cosmological dualistic doctrine of the Yangt and the Yint became an important part of the background of Confucianism.t
Copacati. Incat lake goddess whose worship was mainly centred round Tiahuanaco,t where she was said to have overthrown temples put up to other gods, or to have submerged them beneath the waters of Lake Titicaca.
Corb. In Celtic myth a god of the Fomors,t possibly Iberian.
Couvade. A ritual custom, common all over the world, whereby after the birth of a child the father takes to bed for ten to twelve days. It has been suggested that this is a form of Geasa.t Tabu, or Novana,t whereby individuals, or even whole tribes, have applied to them the same preclusion and precaution as are imposed on the mother of the (presumably) royal child. An alternative explanation is that the practice is intended to obviate the ritual sacrifice of the first-born, which formed such an important part of the religious
background of many peoples, including the Hebrews. A Basque family living in the south of France practised the couvade as recently as September 1952. See also Maiso.
Coyote. A figure common to the culture myths of many of the North American Indian tribes, including the Achomawi,t the Aschochimi,t the Maidu,t the Navajo,t the Sia,t the Tuleyone,t the Yana,t the Yokut,t etc. He is usually depicted as being cunning and resourceful, mischievous and malicious, and corresponds to some extent to the Lokit of Nordic myth. In the Tuleyone Creation Legend, however, he appears as Olle/f the saviour of the world, 52

his part as the agent of destruction having been taken by Sahte.t Among the names given to Coyote are Italapas/f Mahih-Mah-Tlehey.f

spirit of wrath.
Crcdne. The bronze worker, a culture hero of the Tuatha de Danannt who, together with Goibniut and Luchtaine,t made the weapons with which the Fomorsf were defeated.
Crco Indian Creation Legend. This tribe of Knistenaux Indians of North America have a myth that the flesh of the generations which perished in the waters of the Deluge was changed into the deposits of red clay which were found after the waters had subsided.
Creek Indian Creation Legend. The Creation Legend of this tribe, which was common to other members of the Muskhogean family such as the Choctawst and the Seminoles,t begins with the Sea of Waters after the Deluge out of which arose gradually a great mountain, Nunne Chaha,t on which Esaugetuh Emisseef resided. As the waters receded he moulded mankind out of clay and when this had dried in the sun it became endowed with life. These were the ancestors of the tribe. This is an interesting variant of the usual North American Deluge legend as there is no question of the waters having been preceded by a great fire. It is. possible that this particular tribe originated in an area different to that of the majority of their neighbours.
Creirwy. In Celtic myth the daughter of Ceridwenf and sister of Avagdu.t
Cronos. The father of all in the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Damascius. He appears to have been a Middle Eastern god who strayed into Greek and Roman mythology and Iris equation by the Romans with Saturn, the youngest of the Titans, who emasculated Ouranos, or the assumption that he was the father of the Titans and Mott by Rhea, might be explained by the title Cronos being that of a ruler, such as Pharaoh or Caesar, and the stories, memories of pre-Hellenic wars in the Middle Seas. With
him were Potost and Omicle,t who produced Airf and Aura.t
Crow Indian Creation Legend. In the beginning all was water and
the Old Man created the world from the mud which emerged from the waters, and afterwards he created a living couple who were the ancestors of the tribe.

Cu. In Celtic myth the son of Diancecht,t the Celtic god of medicine, brother of Cethet and Cian.f
53



Cuchulainn Czarnobog
Cuchulainn. In Celtic myth one of the greatest heroes of the Ultonian Cycles. His mother was Dechtere,t the sister of King Conchobart of Ulster. The accounts of his youth have a certain resemblance to that of Hercules but this is in all probability due to the tendency of unrelated myths to attach themselves to the persons of great men. He was the great enemy of Aillilt and Medb,t the rulers of Connaught, with whom he was constantly at war. On one occasion on the battle-field he saved Conchobar from death. On one of his expeditions he stole the magic cauldront of Miderf with the aid of Blathnat,t his daughter. He was eventually slain by the King of Leinster.
Culture Hero. It should be noted that while it is quite possible for culture heroes to become gods it is rare that gods become culture heroes. The reason for this is that most gods appear to have started as abstract conceptions and their relationship with mankind was limited to the personalities of the priest or priestess who became identified with the god. The process of deification of the culture hero is relatively common and tends to occur even nowadays with outstanding personalities. It is akin to that of ancestor worship.t
Cupra. Etruscant goddess of fertility, with Tinat and Menrvat forms the Great Triad, having shrines at Veii, Falerii, and Perugia. Her weapon was the thunderbolt, and she appears to be the most ancient of all the Etruscan pantheon, having possibly already been in existence at the time of their arrival in Italy. She is occasionally confused with Feronia,t Ilythyia-Leucothea,t and Thalna.t
Curoi. In Celtic myth priest of the sun god and King of Munster. After the defeat of the Tuatha da Danannt he was killed by Cuchulainnt thanks to the treachery of his wife Blathnat.t
Cyhiraeth. A Celtic goddess of streams who degenerated into a spectre haunting woodland brooks and whose shriek foretold death.
Czarnobog. In Slavonict myth the black god as opposed to Bielbog,t the white god. This dualistic system of organizing the heavens appears to have originated in Persia before the Great Migration. His name was also spelt Zcemoboch.t

Dagon, or Siton,! and although related to the Ouranos group, later acquired a maritime character. In spite of the fact that Philo considered him to be a com god, the description in i Samuel v. 4,

In the Ugarit epics Ben Dagon, son of the above, fought on the side of Baal against El.! 3. Babylonian god of agriculture, usually known as Dagan,! who is confused with the above.

Daikoku Dalhan
personal fate or Fa,f who has to be consulted on all matters of import. The system is one of totemism gone wrong, and its final degeneration is to be seen in voodoot worship in the West Indies.

In Vedic myth the Titans who fought against the gods. They were the sons of Diti.t It is told that at the Churning of the Oceant they endevoured to seize the ambrosia of the gods but were defeated and fled to Patala.t In reality they appear to have been the culture heroes of the races who were defeated by the Vedic invaders in their conquest of India. The descriptions of fights would therefore have been related to actual battles. They are one of the tribes of the Asuras,t who were defeated by Indra.t Hayagriva, the villain of an early Deluge legend, was a Daitya, as was also Hiranyaksha.t Dajdbog. In Slavonict myth a variant of Da-Bog.t Dakota Indians. The two principal figures in Dakota myth are Untunktahe,t the water god, and Waukheon,t the thunder bird. Daksha.

Devaki
Zcnd-Avcstaf it means an evil spirit, while in Buddhismf it may mean hero or goblin, The reason for this is that the original
value of the word was preserved in the Vedas, but by the time it had become incorporated in the Zend-Avesta it had become degraded by the process of Dualism.f The Zoroastrians declared :

Druids Durgha
Druids. The word Druid, which occurs so frequently in Welsh
myth, may possibly come from ‘ derroydd ’ or ‘ oak seer ’ and may also
be related to the Fathit of the Irish Celts. At this stage it is somewhat difficult to determine the main features of the Druidical
religion, but it would appear that the Druids themselves, who may have been of pre-Celtic origin, occupied a position similar to that of
the Magi.t While all the excesses attributed to them by the Romans may not be true, there seems to be no reason for assuming that their religious practices were any milder than those of their contemporaries. The cutting of the mistletoe from the oak would appear to commemorate the emasculation of the old king by his successor. References to them in classical literature include Tacitus, Diogenes Laertius, and Sotion of Alexandria.
Dua. In Egyptian myth a god whose name means To-day. His brother, a lion god, was called Sef,t i.e. Yesterday.
Dualism. This conception of religion, where the power of good was balanced by the power of evil, may have required a long period of gestation before it finally became established. Its beginnings may be linked with the custom of degrading gods of conquered peoples by calling them the powers of evil and setting against them the gods of the victors as powers of good. It may also be linked with the supersession of the mother goddesses by the father gods, and the attempt to degrade them to the status of witches or evil spirits as with Allat.t Other references to Dualism are to be found under Ahriman,t Bielbog/f Black Magic,t Int and Yo,t Koji-Ki/f Mithraism,t Taoism,! Yangt and Yin,t and Zoroastrian.t
Duamutef. In Egyptian myth one of the four divine sons of Ilorus.t Guardian of the East and Canopic protector of the stomach. The others were Amset,t Hapi,t and Qebhsneuf.t The
name means 'Praiser of his Mother.' For further details see Canopic Jars.t
Duat. Egyptian abode of the dead, referred to as Amentit and Tuat.t
Dulachan. In Celtic myth a malicious elft or goblint of foreign origin resembling the cluricanes.f

Durgha. In Vcdic myth a name given to Parvati,t wife of Siva,t
in her aspect as Kali.t The name is that of the giant whose decapi
tated head she bears in her hand. Durgha bears twelve weapons:

Du’uzu. Tire fourth month of the Babylonian year (June), named after Tammuz.t Dwapara. In the Hindu Creation Legendt the third of the four Yugast of the current Mahayugas,! having a length of 2,400 divine years. Dwarfs in Celtic, Teutonic, Slav, and Vedic Myth. The role played by dwarfs in the myths of these races is considerably less important than with the Nordic races. Below are given some of the more outstanding names: Celtic: Gavida,t Goibniu,t Govannon,t Leprechaun,! Luchorpain,t Luchtaine.t Teutonic: Kobold,t Mara.t Slav: Karliki,t Ljeschi/f Lychie.t Vedic: Tvashtri,t Vamanat. Dwarfs in Nordic Myth. In Nordic myth the dwarfs play a very important part in that they are the artificers, the craftsmen, and the inventors. Both the Aesirf and the Vanirt appear to have maintained amicable relations with the dwarfs, and in return for this they made such things as Brisingamen,t the necklace of Freyaf; Draupnir,t the ring of Odint ; Gungnir,t the sword of Odin ; Hringhorn,t the ship of Balder,t and Skidbladnir,t the ship of Freyt ; and the wig of Sif.t Many of these are included in the list of treasures.t In practice the dwarfs appear in the same relationship to the Scandinavians as to the Celts and the Slavs and there seems but little doubt that they were a short, round-headed central European tribe possessing the art of working in bronze and iron in addition to precious metals. In the following is given a list of the more important dwarfs mentioned in the Eddast: Ai, Alfar,t Alfreikr (elf king Albericht), Althjofr, Alviss,t An, Andvari,t Annar, Austri, Baumbur, Bavor, Bivor (the Tremulous), Dainn,t Davalin,t Dolgthasir, Dori, Draupnir,t Dufr, Duneyr, Durathror, Durinn, Eikinskjaudi, Fili, Fith, Fjalar,t Frosti, Fundin, Galar/f Gandalfr, Ginnar, Gloinn, Harr,t Hepti, Hljodalfr, Hogstari, Ivaldi, Kili, Litur,t Mjodvitnir, Moin, Naglfar,t Nain, Nali, Nar, Nibelung,t Nipingr, Nordri, Nori, Norori, Nyi, Nyr, Nvradr, Oinn, Ori, Radsvithr, Regin,t Sjarr, Skandar, Skirvir, Sudri, Thekkr,t Thorinn, Thror,t Throrinn, Veigur, Vestri, Vindalfr, Virvir, Vithur, Yingi. Certain of these names are also names of Odin, thereby showing the close relationship between the Aesir and the dwarfs. Further details will be found under Alfheim,t E]f,f Fays,t Lovar,t Yggdrasil,t etc.
Dwyvan and Dwyvach. In the Celtic creation mytht the man

Dyaush-Pitir Dyu
with an assortment of animals, they escaped from the deluge caused by the Addancyf a monster who dwelt by Llyon Llion,t the Lake of the Waves. This legend is pre-Celtic but has suffered from Christian additions.
Dyaush-Pitir. Primitive Aryan sky father who may be equated with Zeus and Jupiter although the adventures of both of them clearly belong to the history of the Mediterranean Sea. By the time the Vedast were written Dyaush had already receded into the background. It is possible that Dyaush-Pitir may originally have been a sun-mother goddess.
Dyavo. In Slavonic myth the demons of Serbia, in whom it is just possible to recognize the Devast of Vedic and Zoroastrian myths.
Dylan. In Celtic myth a sea god, the brother of Lleu.t As soon as he was bom he was said to have plunged into the sea and swum like a fish, and accordingly was called Eiiton/f or son of the wave. The word dile is an old Irish term for flood, while, according to Wormius, Endilt was another name for him as a sea god. Dylan was eventually slain by Govannon,t whose relationship to him seems to have been purely mythological, Dylan being a chief of the Celtic invaders from the sea, and Govannon being an artificer, possibly a dwarff and a member of the pre-Celtic clans of Britain.
Dyrnwyn. The sword of Rhydderch Hael, one of the treasures! of Britain.
Dyu. In Vedic myth one of the eight Vasus,t the divine attendants of Indra.t The word means heaven, and may have some affinity with Dyaush.t
63



E
God ‘ E.’ Mayant maize god who is probably the same as the
Aztec Cinteotl.t His head-dress is an ear of com and he may be
either Ghanant or Yum Kaax.t Ea. Ea, who was first known as Nudimmud,t or Nidim,t was the first of the Babylonian new order of gods, as opposed to Tiamat/f Apsu,t and Mommu,t in the Babylonian Creation Legend.t Ea, as the
champion of purity, fought and defeated Apsu and Mommu by the
utterance of a powerful spell. He then divided Apsu, who was his mother and whose name means ‘ the Fresh Water Sea,’ into chambers and made a resting place for himself. Later, when Tiamat as
sembled the forces of evil to avenge the death of Apsu, Ea called in the aid of Anshar,t who appointed Mardukt as champion of the new gods. From the blood of Kingu,t the defeated leader, he created mankind. Ea was the water god of Eridu, and also the god of
wisdom whose jealousy deprived humanity of eternal life. He was third of the Great Triad of Gods with Anut and Enlil.t One of his daughters was Nina.t Ea is the same as Oannest and can be equated to Damkina.t Ealur. In Babylonian myth a name given to Zarpanit.t
Ear. One of a series of names given in south Germany to Tiwaz or Tyr.t Easter Island Creation Legend. The earliest myths of Easter Island refer to struggle for supremacy between the ‘Big Ears’ and the ‘Small Ears.’ It is not now possible to say where the ‘ Big Ear’ people, the prototype of the statues, came from; but there are elements of Melanesian culture which appear to be similar. The colossal stone statues of long-eared people wearing pumice-stone hats have long been a mystery to archaeologists; they possibly represented a link with some vanished culture of the Pacific. Unfortunately it has not been possible to decipher the petroglyphs or to interpret the drawings of birds and birdmen, which seem to relate to some unusual form of worship. The native name for Easter Island is Rapanui.t They had a creator god, Meke Meke,t who may have been Tangaroa,t the Polynesiant god.
Ebisu. Japanese god of labour, the son of Daikoku.t He is usually depicted with a fishing rod, and a fish under his arm, and may originally have been a god of the fishermen’s clan. He was one of the seven divinities of luck, the Shichi Fukujin.t
Eda Male. Twin idols, male and female, used by the Ogoboni tribe of the Yorubast in their initiation ceremonies. 64



Eddas
Eddas
Eddas. The Eddas, the source books of Nordic myths, have come
to us mainly in three texts. The oldest of these is the Elder Edda or Codex Regius, considered to have been drawn up by the Icelandic historian Saemund about the year 1090. The next is_a Christianized version by Saxo Grammaticus written in 1190 and included in the Gesta Danorum. Unfortunately this version has been so modified in accordance with the existing religious sentiments as to be almost valueless. The third and last version is the Prose Edda drawn up by Snorri Sturlason in 1220. The vast majority of the stories and myths of the Scandinavians have come to us from the Elder and the Prose Eddas. The fact that both these codices were discovered in Iceland seems to prove that the disintegrating impact of Christianity only reached that country after the legends had been reduced to writing, and was therefore too late to be fully effective. The stories of the Eddas are independent of the great body of Celtic myth, although there are certain points, particularly in the treasures,! where they tend to overlap. They bear the impression of the early struggles of at least four racial groups involved in the development of the Northlands. These were the giants,! whom we take to be the first hyperborean inhabitants (the Frost Giants! may have been the heroes of the Kalevalaf and the Hero of Estonia!), and the dwarfs,! who were eventually dominated by a combination of two invading groups, the Vanirt and the Aesir.t In a similar manner to the Celts the Norsemen appear to have been incapable of working metals and were forced to rely upon the services of the dwarfs,! who may be considered to be a tribe of short, sturdy, Central European stock specializing in metal working and other crafts. An alphabetical list of the works included in the Elder and the Prose Eddas is given below. Details about them will be found under the appropriate headings. Aegisdrekka or Lokasenna (Aegir’sf Carousal or the Taunting of Lokit) ; Alvis-Mal (The Lay of Alvisst) ; * Braga Raedur (The Conversations of Bragif); *Eptirmali; Fjol Svinns Mai!; * Formali

Efrit Egyptian
Efrit. The second most powerful dass of jinnt in pre-Islamic myth. Egg. In the Phoenidan Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos, Mot,t the primeval egg, was the child of Wind! and Desiret (Potos). In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Mochus, the egg was produced by Oulomosf and when broken gave rise to Ouranost and Gea.t The Ghaddarf and certain other jinnt are said to have sprung from an egg: this may be a distorted Arabian version of the Creation Legends. See also Narayana,t Ghaddar/f Egyptian Creation Legends, Khnemu.t Egih In Nordic myth the brother of Volund,t who at the court of King Nithudt shot with an arrow an apple o2 the head of a young boy, a feat later attributed to William Tell. Later he assisted Iris brother to escape. He was the son of Badi.t
Egyptian Creation Legends. There is a great similarity between the Creation Legends of the Nile Valley and those of the Fertile Crescent. In all of them the beginning was a primitive chaotic mass of waters known to the Babylonians as Tamtu,t Tiamat,t or Tiawath,t and to the Hebrews as Tohut or Tchom.t One would therefore expect the Egyptian chaos monster to have had a name fitting into this common pattern, but instead he is called Nun,t or Nu.t However, there is also a primeval god called Atmu,t who is said to have caused the Deluge, from which it would appear that he or she was the original mass of waters, and that at some later date Nun or Nu was installed in this position. There are several alternative versions of the actual creation process, of which the simplest is that the sun arose from the waters, and that when the light had made a rift between the earth and the sky, four pillars, marking the cardinal points, were erected to hold up the heavens. At Hermopolis, however, Thotht was the mind and intelligence of Nu, and, with the aid of Khnemut and Ptah,t created several pairs of gods, including Herat and Hehut, Kekuit and Kekuit, Qeh and Qerhit, and afterwards the remainder of the universe. At Sais, Neith,t the self-created virgin goddess, became the mother of Ra,t from whom sprang the gods. At Hermopolis, Khepera,t the scarab beetle god, created Gebt and Nut,t the parents of Osirist and Isist and of other gods. At Elephantine it was Khnemuyf the potter god, who created the universe, made the cosmic eggt from the mud of the Nile, and shaped man on his potter’s wheel, while at Memphis the same part was played by Ptah,t who in the process of development seems to have absorbed Tenen,t an early creator god. Contrary to general opinion, there are at least two Egyptian Deluge legends, of which the earliest says that the god Atmu caused the waters of the great deep to overflow and drown every66



Egyptian Egyptian
body, except those who were with him in his boat. This would
indicate that when Atmu, as mentioned above, was deposed frorn the post of god of the mass of waters, he, in turn, took over the functions
of the Egyptian Noah or Uta-Napishtim,t whose name may some day
be discovered.
The other Deluge legend tells how Ra, being offended with his subjects, ordered Hathorf and Sekhmet,t the fire goddess, to destroy
them all. After they had partially completed their work, and were
wading in human blood, Ra relented, and, being unable to persuade them to desist, flooded the world with beer, which the goddesses drank to such an extent that they forgot all about their dreadful mission. This rewriting of an early myth of volcanic catastrophe followed by flood is rather different to those of the countries to the
north-east, where there are references mainly to floods. There may also be a faint recollection of a flood in the hieroglyph of the Bennut bird. Also there is Manetho’s story of Thotht setting up the Siriadic Columns,t before the Deluge, in order that the records of the past should not be lost.
Egyptian Religion. It is not possible to give more than the briefest outline of Egyptian religion in the space available. The original basis appears to have been the totems of the pre-dynastic tribes, many of which were female, and later became metamorphosed into goddesses and gods. In the earliest stages these birds, beasts, and fishes were recognized for what they were, but later, with the advent of the polytheism which is the sure sign of religions in decay, they all were endowed with the functions of actual gods. Later came the divine Icings, originally perhaps the object of sacrifice, but later to emerge as supreme rulers. The story of the murder of Osirist is clearly that of the death by sacrifice of a barley king. Such beings as Anit,t Anquet,t Hathor,t Isis,t Maat,t Nephtys,t Ptah,t Set,t and Thotht may have been kings and queens, priests and priestesses, who were deified after their deaths; while the stories of the fights between the gods are obviously memories of intertribal wars, in which Set, Osiris, Horus,t Isis, and Nephtys were the names of leading personalities involved. As it is obvious that no human beings were actually present at the Creation, in whatever manner it may have occurred, the Creation Legendst of the Egyptians, in common with those of other countries, must be made up of memories of some great disaster from which
mankind only emerged with great difficulty, combined with priestly ideas as to what might possibly have occurred in the beginning. 1 he gradual change of Osiris from being the god of a most depressing nether world into the potential saviour of the soul must have
taken a long time, and is intimately linked up with the story of his resurrection by Isis and of his begetting Horus in the interval before 67



Ehecatl El
he became ruler of the Kingdom of the Dead. The somewhat excessive preoccupation of the Egyptian with the problems of the next world must have been fostered by the dry climate which made mummification relatively easy, and also by the fact that the system of regulated agrarian life left long periods for leisure and contemplation. The trend towards monotheism, which came to its zenith with the worship of Aten,t appears always to have been that of the ruling classes, as the vast bulk of the populace preferred the potential delights of the Osirian paradise to the somewhat impersonal joys of accompanying Rat in his sun boat. The problem of life in the after-world is revealed by the number of parts of the body and personality which had to be considered. They were the Khatf or physical body; the Kat or double; the Bat or soul; the Khut or aura; the Khaibitt or shadow; the Sekhemt or vital force; the Rent or name; the Abt or will, symbolized as a heart; the Hatit or physical heart; the Sahut or spirit body; and the Ikht or final spiritual state. The Egyptians may take credit for having evolved the first Holy Trinity of Father, Mother, and Child (Osiris, Isis, and the Child Horus), and also for conception of the future life directly related to the moral value of conduct on this earth, and, finally, the first abstract monotheism, in the worship of Aten, in 1375 b.c., which
arose at a time when the Hebrews were still struggling in Canaan. For further details see Book of the Dead,t Egyptian Creation Legends,! and references to named goddesses and gods.
Ehecatl. Aztect wind god, sometimes confused with Quetzal

God ‘M.’t
Ekhi. A variant of Sutt or Set! in Egyptian myth.
El. See Elat.! Semitic term for god. When ‘El’ stands alone, the term means ‘God,’ the supreme being. In Phoenician mythology as revealed by the Ugarit tablets El was an old man also
known as Alik ab Anm meaning ‘ the King, Father of Years,’ or ‘ the Old King,’ which explains why in Roman times he was compared, if not identified, with Cronos.! El lived, not in heaven, but in the 6S



Elagabalus El-Khadir
‘Sad El. ’ or Field of God (compare with the Egyptian Sekhet-Aaru,t)
situated near the seashore at the point where rivers flow into the ocean. With him lived several other persons, the most important of whom is a goddess called Asheratianyf the Ashera of the Sea, who is also to be identified with Elat,t the goddess far excellence.
the wife of El. The possibility that El might be the supplanter of a still earlier god is shown by the story quoted by Philo in the Phoenician Creation Legendt that he revolted against his parent Ouranost with the aid of his brothers and sisters. His children were
Persephone, Athena, Eros, etc. By Damkinaf he was the father of Marduk.t As the moon husband of the sun goddess, El was known as Eterah.t In the Ugarit texts he was the father of Saharf and Salem.t Elagabalus. Roman emperor, a.d. 218-22, who was worshipped at Emesa as a variant of Baal.t His image was a black aerolith.

of venom which turned into the giant Ymir,t whose sweat while sleeping engendered the Frost Giants.t
El-Khadir. The Old Man of the Sea of Muslim legends and the
Arabian Nights. The name is derived from Xisuthros,t which in its turn has been transformed from Hasisatra.t He is greatly vener
ated in the part of Syria inhabited by the Alaouites (formerly the

Enki
Elli
Elli. In Nordic myth the giant crone of old age with whom Thorf wrestled without success, as told in the Lay of Skrymir.t Elom. Name given to the moon by the southern Hebrews. Variants of Elom were Eterah,! Ilmaqah,! Jerah/f Sahar,! and Terah.t Elthan. A chief of the Fomorst and the father of Bress/f who for a short period became King of Ireland. Elves. In Nordic myth the elves were the dwellers in Alfheim,! the dwelling place of Frey.t There were also black elves who dwelt in Svartheim,! but whether this differentiation was one of actual complexion as between two of the tribes of dwarfs or whether it was merely a term of derogation applied to those who were not friendly with the Aesirt is not clear. The question is gone into in greater detail in the article on dwarfs.t Allied with the elves are the brownies,t cluricanes,t the Dulachans,t Fenodyrees.t In Celtic myth Ailillt may be an elf or dwarf.t
Embla. In the Nordic Creation Legendt the wife of Askt created out of a tree. The fact that her name was not Eskga, which would have paired with Ask, makes it appear that the combination results from the fusion of two different legends.
Emma-O. Japanese Buddhist god who was the lord of Yomi,t the other world, and who sat in judgment on the dead. Emrys. In Celtic myth the city of Dinas Emrys, a name given to Myrddint or Merlin.t It has been identified as a fortification called Broich y Ddinas on the summit of Penmaen. Emrys is also a
Welsh rendering of the late Roman name Ambrosius.
Endil. A marine deity of the Celts who may be the same as Dylan.t His name still exists as St. Endellion of the parish of the same name in north Cornwall.
Enigorio and Enigohatgea. In the Iroquoist Creation Legend these were the twin brothers, Enigorio having been the benign creator of rivers, fertile plans, and fruitful trees, and his brother Enigohatgea endeavouring to neutralize all these activities by the creation of deserts, harmful plants, and natural catastrophes. They are the equivalent of Ioskehat and Tawiscarat in the Huron! Creation Legends.
Enki. Babylonian god of fresh water and water god of Eridu

was said to have been created by Arurut from her own spittle mixed with clay.
70



Enlightener Epact
Enlightener of the Darkness. In Chineset myth we are told that this dragont produces light by opening his eyes and causes darkness by shutting them. His serpent-like body is a thousand miles long
and of a filthy colour. He never rests and his breath causes wind and cold weather. He can assume nine colours and his breath descends as a rain of water or fire. Gold is the congealed breath of white dragons, crystal the spittle of purple dragons, and glass solidified dragon breath.
En-lil. Originally titular deity of Nippur in Babylonia. He was addressed as ‘the Great Mountain’ and ‘Lord of the Storm,’ from which it is concluded that his original habitat was a mountain-top city ; as there are no mountains in the Euphrates valley, he must
have been the god of a people living in a mountainous area who later emigrated to Babylonia. As Nippur was originally a Sumerian city, it seems safe to presume that the cult of En-lil was of Sumerian origin. The term Lil also means demon; he may therefore have been ‘the Lord Demon’ (see Lilith). In the Great Babylonian Triad of Anu,t En-lil, and Ea,t En-lil was god of the earth. The great Assyrian winged bulls are considered to represent him. He was frequently referred to as Bel,t but the Bel of the Apocrypha was most likely the god Marduk,t who was also referred to by this title. In Assyria, Tiglath refers to En-lil as 'Old Bel,’ and Sargon calls him ‘the Great Mountain.’ En-lil was subsequently displaced by Marduk. He was the father of Sint and Enurta,t and of the heavenly bodies, the sun, the moon, Venus, and, later, Mars. He was son of Anu.t His wife, in some versions, was Ninlil.t
Enmesliarra. Babylonian god of the underworld Aralu,t or Mcslam.t Ministered to by a special kind of priest called Kalu.t
Ennead. Name given to the ‘Paut’ or great company of nine Egyptian gods of Heliopolis: Atmuyf Shu,t Tefnut,t Geb,t Nut,f Osirist and Isis,t Sett and Nephtys.t To this list Rat, Horus/t Uadjit,t IIu,t Saa,t and Khenti Amentit were sometimes added.
Enurta. The name of the Assyrian god of war Ninib,t represented by a bird of prey, is sometimes spelt Enurta. He was the son of Enlil,t and the husband of Gulat and Ba’u.t
Enzu. Alternative name for Nannaryf the Babylonian moon god.
He may be equated with Sin.t
Eostre. Teutonic goddess who gave her name to Easter. The
word may have evolved from Ishtar,t as her festival has some
resemblance to the Babylonian spring festival.

enabling not only Osirisf but also Horust the Elder, Set,t Isis/f and Nephtyst to be bom, these days being celebrated as the birthdays of the gods. In actual fact the date of the introduction of the change in the calendar must have been at a time when the heliacal rising of Sirius coincided with the rise of the Nile, which cannot have taken place later than 4231 b.c., as by the next rising of Sirius in 2871 b.c.
the calendar was already in use. It may even have been changed before the first-mentioned date. Epona. Goddess of a continental Celtic tribe, having a horse
totem. A bas-relief showing her riding on horseback was found at
Mainz. A recent writer has suggested that ‘pony’ is derived from
Epona, which may also have been a Celtic word for mare. That the horse is always associated with the sea gods may possibly mean that the first horses came by water. Epunamun. A war god of the Araucaniant Indians. Probably of
Inca origin and has certain points in common with Punchau.1 an Incaf sun god. Erchtag. A variant of Ear,t a name for Tiwaz.t
Ereshkigel. Alternative name for Ninmug,t the wife of Nergal.t in Babylonian myth. Ercildoune, Thomas of. An English nobleman who is said to sleep with his knights in a cavern in Eildon Hill.

Alternative spelling for Renenit,t the Egyptian goddess of birth and child-bearing. ,
Esaugetuh Emissee. Chief god of the Creekt Indians. He was a wind deity and his name means Lord of Wind. In the Creekt Creation Legend it is told how he took up his residence on Nunne Chahat as the waters of the flood receded and there proceeded to make the ancestors of the tribe out of wet clay. Eset. Alternative spelling of Isist in Egyptian myth.
Eshmun. 1. The Baal of Sidon in Phoenicia. He is equated by some classical authors with Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. The word appears to mean ‘ the name,’ and to have been used in some cases in lieu of ‘Baal.’ 2. Eshmun of Byblos was a title given to Hey-Tau.f Eskimo Myths. The Eskimos have a chief deity, known as Tomarsuk,t and a goddess of food, known as Sednat or Amaknagsak.t

Etain. In Celtic myth the wife of Mider,t who was stolen from him by Angus.t
Ethne. In Celtic myth the daughter of Balorf who, having been warned that he would be killed by his grandson, imprisoned her to prevent her marriage.

She may be taken to be the same person as Arianrhod,t the daughter of Beli.f Comparative pedigreesare given under Lleu.t
Etruscan Religion. Owing to the fact that the mystery of the Etruscan language is still only partially solved, much of their religious background is still unknown. Such details as are available come mainly from classical writers, from monuments, and from mirrors. There were twelve great gods, six of each sex, who were called ‘the Senators of the Gods’ and ‘the Penates of the Thunderer Himself.’ Their chief was Tin.t They were fierce and pitiless deities whose name it was forbidden to utter, but they were not deemed eternal but supposed to rise and fall together. Above the great gods were the ‘Shrouded Gods,’ who ruled both gods and men. In practice, however, the three gods of greatest importance were Tin, Cupra,t and Menrva.t The Thunderbolt-hurling Gods, such as
Summanust and Sethlans,t were subordinate to these. Besides these there were Voltumna,t mother goddess; Feronia,t Horta.t Ilythyia-Leucotheayt Thalna,t and Turan,t who were fertility goddesses; Nortia,t the goddess of fortune; Losna,t the
moon goddess; and Fuflunsyf the Bacchic god. Finally there
were the guardians of Hades, Mantust and Ms wife Mania.

Euwe Ewuo
Euwe Peoples. Tliey had two gods Bot and So,t who was also known as Khebieso.t Evnisien. In Celtic myth the son of Penard’unt by her first marriage, and stepbrother of Bran,t King of Britain, and Branwen.t By spite he caused the hatred between them and Matholwch,t and later, when a reconciliation was on the point of being arranged, he burnt his nephew Gwem,t the son of Branwen and Matholwch, to death, and killed himself by jumping into Llassar’s Cauldront of Rebirth. In another version he received the cauldron from Bran and proceeded with it to Ireland as an emissary. There he allied himself with Matholwch and slew his stepbrother in the ensuing war. The story of the embittered hatred of the displaced heir to the throne, for his stepbrother, the King of Britain, and his stepsister, the Queen of Ireland, has within it a tragic element of historical truth. Ewuo. In Yorubaf myth name given to the taboo against women seeing Oro,t the Nigerian bull-roarer, in use.

F
God * F.’ Mayant war or sacrifice god similar to the Xipet of the Aztecs. He is frequently represented as successfully attacking Ekchuaht (God ‘M’t), the god of travellers. Fa. The god of destiny of the fetish worshippers of Dahomey .t This god has a special name for each follower, and is consulted through his priests on every occasion of import. The basic assumption is that human destiny is only fixed within certain limits, and that by consulting one’s Fa one can obtain advice as to which course of action is the less likely to have ill effects. It does not seem less effective than similar practices elsewhere. Fafnir. In Nordic myth, as expressed in the Volsung Cycle, the Nibelungenlied,t etc., he was the guardian of the treasure. He was later slain by Sigurdt or Siegfried.t In the Volsung Cycle he is described as a giant, but this would seem to be an error in that the guardians of the treasure were usually dwarfs.
Fallas. In Celtic myth the city of the north, one of the four from which originated the Tuatha de Danann.t From it came the Lia Fail, or Stone of Destiny, which was one of the treasures of the Tuatha, and which may be the stone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey. The other cities were Finias,t Gorias,t and Murias.t There is some resemblance between this and the story of Bouyan.t Fand. In Celtic myth wife of Manannan,t whom he deserted.
Farbauti. Father of Loki,t the Nordic Merlin.t His wife was Laufcy or Nal, and his other children were Byleifstr and Helblindi.f
Faridu. In Persian myth an early king who overthrew Bevarash,t the last of the Azidahaka dynasty of serpent-kings, and condemned him to be bound to Mount Demavand.
Fathach. In Celtic myth the poet king of the Firbolgs.t The
word may be related to Fathit—Irish equivalent for Druids.t He
was the husband of Nessat and the father of Conchobar.t Fathi. Irish equivalent of the Welsh Druids.t The word may be related to Fathach,t the poet of the Firbolgs.t
Fati (or Fadu). In the Society Islands myth, the moon, the son of Rouat by Taonoui.t
Fays. While most fairy lore belongs to a period considerably later than that covered by this work, their origin appears to be linked with the priestesses of the pre-Celtic matriarchal races. In the majority of early accounts the fays are women only, but there

are a few accounts of fairy men which are not irreconcilable with the foregoing, and the visitor is able to stay in their realms for quite long periods of time without seeing any men, which would indicate either a clan of priestesses as suggested, or alternatively that the men of the tribe were away hunting and would only return for the spring or the autumn fertility festivals, the approach of which would automatically terminate the stay of any outsider who hoped to survive. That they were pre-Celtic is indicated by their not knowing the use of iron and by their inability to count above five. Whether they are to be linked with the dwarfst or not is not clear, but it is significant that there are few references to women in stories about the dwarfs .t Fea. In Celtic myth a war goddess, subordinate to Morrigut
;
the name means ‘the Hateful.’ Feather Cloak of Freya. This magic garment, named Valhamr,t which is mentioned in the Nordic stories of Thiassit and of Thrym,t appears to have given the user the power to fly through the air. Unfortunately no further details about it are available.
Fenodyree. A name for a hairy being, or satyr, similar to the dwarfst of Nordic myth and the elves,t brownies,t and cluricanest of the Celts. In actual fact it appears to be a memory of the pre-Celtic and pre-Teutonic inhabitants of western Europe.
Fenrir. The Fenris Wolf of Nordic myth, one of the monsters spawned by Loki.t As it could not be restrained by any force of the Aesir,t they asked the dwarfst to make a suitable cord to fetter it, which they did from ‘ the noise of the footfall of a cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones, the sinews of bears, the breath of fish, and the spittle of birds.’ It was as light as silk but strong enough to hold the monster, although in the act of binding him the hand of Tyrf was bitten off. He remained captive until Ragnarok,t when he killed Odint and was slain by Vidar.t He is to some extent linked with Vlkodlaks.t
Fergus. An early king of Ulster who fell in love with Nessa,t the mother of Conchobar,t who consented to marry him on condition that he should hand over to her son the sovereignty for a year, at the end of which time his people refused to restore him to the kingship. Later, while in exile he acted as tutor to a nephew of Conchobar named Cuchulainn,t one of the greatest figures of early Irish history.
Feronia. An Etruscan fire and fertility goddess who is sometimes confused with Cupra.t

Finias Fj°l
bronze and silver and having some resemblance to the orichalcum of the Greeks. In the voyage of the sons of Corra,f a maiden is mentioned as wearing sandals of findrina.
Finias. In Celtic myth the city of the south and one of the four from which came the Tuatha de Danann.t From here they brought the sword or spear of Nuda,t later one of the treasurest of the Tuatha. The other cities were Falias,t Gorias,t and Murias.t
Finn. In Celtic myth the son of Cumhal or Camulos,t a king of the Tuatha dc Danann.t As a child he was apprenticed to a magician of the same name who was fishing for the salmon of know
ledge in the pool at the source of the Boyne or Boann.f When the salmon was caught Finn burnt his thumb on it and on sucking it to case the pain became possessed of all knowledge. This story resembles that of the magic cauldronf of Annwn,t particularly as the nine maidens who attend such a cauldron are replaced by nine hazeltrees, a mistaken rendering due to the passage of time. The story of his betrothed Grainnet who eloped with Diarmaitt is told under those headings. He was the father of Ossian.t

Finola. In Celtic myth the eldest daughter of Llyr.t
Fintaan. Husband of Cesarat and father of Larat in a Deluge myth given in the Celtic Creation Legend.t
Firbolgs. In Celtic myth the third dynasty of ancient Ireland following those of Nemedt and Partholon.f It is possible that they occupied portions of Ireland simultaneously with the Fomors,t but the tendency of early myth has been to keep them separate. The Fir Domnann and the Gailioin appear to have been subdivisions of the same tribe, and their first leader was Simeon Brec, known as the Freckled, and the last king was Eochaidh Mac Eire, whose wife Tailitiu became the foster-mother of Lught after their defeat by the Tuatha de Danann.t One of their kings was Fathach.t
Fire. One of the three children of Genosf and Genea in the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos, the others being Flamct and Light.t From Fire came the giants,t including Hyposouraniost and Ousoos.t

Fjorgyn Fravashis
Fjorgyn. In Nordic myth the giant mother of Frigga/f and wife of Odint and wife or mother of Thor.t She was one of the Asynjor.t At some later stage a husband was devised for her with the name Fjorgynn. He corresponds to Perkunas.t
Flame. Brother of Firet and Lightt in the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos.
Flatey Book. A fourteenth-century manuscript, containing, in addition to long lists of Norwegian kings, two of the Eddie poems, the Chant of Hundlat and the shorter version of the Voluspa.f
Folkvangr. In Nordic myth the ‘folk meadow’ or dwelling of Frevaf and also her zodiacal housed
Fomors. In Celtic myth the fourth dynasty of ancient Ireland, succeeding that of the Firbolgst and preceding that of the Tuatha de Danann.t They appear to have developed from the Fir Domnann, who were one of the subdivisions of the Firbolgs. Their goddess or queen was Domnu.t Their leaders were Balor,t Bress,t Elthan,t Indech.t Net,t and Tethra.t Like the Firbolgs they were a maritime race and it is possible that in both cases there were many expeditions to Ireland before a settlement was attempted. They were eventually defeated by the Tuatha at the battle of Mag Tuireadh.t
Formosan Creation Legend. Details of this are given under Awun,t Infoniwoo,t and Peiroun.t
Forseti. In Nordic myth one of the Aesirt and the son of Balderf and Nanna.t He was the dispenser of justice and seems to have been a Frisian deity who became absorbed into Scandinavian culture at some early period. Heligoland was once known as Forsetisland and was formerly sacred to him. Humans are said to have been sacrificed to him there, while the sheep on the island were considered to be his property. Among the Teutons the spelling became Vorsitzer (chairman or president), and as such may have been linked with Dings.t His zodiacal houset was Glitnir, which comes under the sign of Virgo, but one is inclined to believe that this is inappropriate and that either he should come under Libra, and have the house of Noatun assigned to Njord,t or he should not appear in the list at all, having taken the place of some early mother goddess, possibly Jord.t
Fravashis. In Zoroastrian myth the guardian ancestor spirits of the believers. The)’ date back to the very earliest periods and are specifically omitted from the Dathas, or fundamental statements of doctrine in the Zend-Avesta.f They constitute a form of ancestor worshipt and are of interest as they show a stage in the process whereby the great ones of the past acquire divine or semi-divine rank. 7S



Frey Fre7a
Frey. In Nordic myth the son of Njordt and Skadi,t who resided
in Alfheim,! which was also tlie name of his zodiacal house,t from
which it may be presumed that he was related to the dwarfs.t He
had a ship Skidbladnir,! built by the dwarfs, which could contain all
the Aesir,t but which could be folded up. His sword, which rendered him invincible, was given by him to Skimirf in return for his services
in persuading Gerda,! a giantess,! to marry him. Owing to this he
fell to the arms of Surtt at Ragnarok.f Adam of Bremen identifies him with Frikka,t the husband of
Frigga,t which is quite possible, although it is not clear whether this might not make him a Teutonic rather than a northern character. He is found associated with the boar, two of which, Gullinbursti and
Slidrurgtanni, drew his chariot, from which it may be assumed that he was originally the chief of a boar clan of the Vanirt who later became merged with the Aesir. Later he became one of the three gods who shared the great temple at Upsala. He is always known
as the brother of Frevat and his promotion to the rank of god may be yet another case of the supersession of a goddess by a god occurring after the end of the matriarchy. The attempts to fuse the personalities of Frey and Yngvi, or Ingr, the chief of the Ingaevones, as put forward in the Ynglinga Saga, do not appear to have any solid foundation. He was called Frea by the Anglo-Saxons.
Freya. In Nordic myth one of the Asynjorf and wife of Odint and mother of Hnossa.t She appears to have been originally a moon goddess and to have travelled in a chariot drawn by two cats, and also to have been priestess of a clan having a hawk totem. This element of confusion may have arisen from the fact that by the time she was taken over by the Aesirt her cult was so ancient that it had already acquired certain portions of other cults. She lived in Folkvangr,t which was also her zodiacal house,! and received half the dead slain in battle. Her marriage to Odin was a purely mythological one. Her personality tended to become merged with
that of Frigga.t who may well have been a different entity. In the later stages of Scandinavian religion she was the goddess of love, of marriage, and of fertility. Her necklace Brisingamen! and her feather cloak,! Valhamr, are included in the treasures! of the Aesir.
On two occasions the giants! tried to get her away from the Aesir; on
the first she was demanded as payment for the building of the wall of Asgardt and was saved by Loki,! and on the second her hand in
marriage was asked for by Thrym,! and on this occasion she was
saved by Loki and Thor.! The word Freya means lad}- in the same
way as Frey means lord. Freya was also known as Gef(jo)nt, Horn,! Mardoll,! Mengladf
or Mcnglod, Syr,t and Vanadis.! Her partial supersession by Frey
was probably a stage in the replacing of the early fertility goddesses

Frigga Fujin
by gods. From this goddess we get our Friday, but it is not sure whether the placing of the day in the same position in the week as dies Veneris, or vendredi, is not a coincidence. It seems probable that apart from being representative of one of the mother goddesses she was also a sibyl. The story of how she saved the Vinili from their opponents is told by Paulus Diaconus. Odinf had promised victor)' to the Vandals, the enemies of the Vinili. They appealed for help to Freya, who told them to bring their wives to see Odin early the next morning and for the women to drape their hair round their faces like beards. Odin on seeing these said: ‘Who are
these Langobards [or longbeards] ?
’ Freya said: ‘As you have named them you must give them the victory.’ And this Odin was obliged to do. In the story of Hyndla,t Freya mounts a boar to ride to Valhalla. As, however, it was Freyt whose chariot was drawn by two boars, there must have been some confusion between the two accounts. It seems probable that the boars originally belonged to Freya and were later transferred to Frey.
Frigga. In Nordic myth Frigga appears to have usurped the place of Freyat and to have become not only the wife of Odin! but also the chief of the Asynjor.t She was a Teutonic mother goddess, and while she may originally have been the same as Freya, by the time she was brought into contact with the Aesirt she presented a strong element of competition. The later date of her arrival is shown by the fact that although she had a residence called Fensalir, ‘the Halls of the Sea,’ this never became her zodiacal house,! as was the case with Folkvangr,t the residence of Freya. By Odinf she was the mother of Balder.f
Frikka. Name meaning lover or wooer given by Adam of Bremen to Frey.f
Frimla. A Nordic virgin goddess who wore gold ribbon in her hair. At some period she was absorbed into the Asynjorf as a personal attendant of Frigga.f She may be the same as Fimila.f

Futsunushi. Japanese fire or lightning god. He was one of the emissaries sent by Ama-Terasuf to force the abdication of Onamujif in order that Ninigit could come to the throne. His associate in this work was Takemikadzuchi,t the thunder god.

Gandharvas. In Vedic myth the heavenly choristers of Swarga,t the heaven of Indra.f They are usually found associated with the Apsaras,t the celestial nymphs of Swarga. They were said to have a great partiality for women, and the word Gandharva was used to describe a marrage ‘from affection without any nuptial rite.’
Ganesa. In Vedic myth the god of wisdom and the patron of literature. He is usually depicted with the head of an elephant. The story goes that his mother, Parvati,t showed him to Siva,t whose glance destroyed his head, which was replaced by that of an elephant. As Ganesa is corpulent, it is possible that his designation as an elephant may have been due to his bulk and to his rank as the leader of the armed forces of Siva, in which case the elephant’s trunk would be a later addition. In Japan he was known as Shodent. In Swargat his celestial city was Kailasat on Mount Meru.t
Ganga (the Ganges River). In Vedic myth the Ganges was the most sacred of all the rivers in India. It was formerly the custom for pilgrims to start from the source of the river at Gangotri and to walk down the left bank to the mouth at Ganga-sagara, and then to return to the source by the right bank. This pilgrimage, which takes six years to accomplish, is called Pradakshini, and great merit was acquired by it. The guide to persons undertaking these pilgrimages was known as a Gangaputra. The sacredness of this river is due to the belief that it flows from the toe of Vishnu.t Its waters are said to hold great curative properties.
Gann. In Nordic myth the hell-dog slain at Ragnarokt by Tyrt in a terrible conflict in which both participants died. It is the same as the moon hound of Teutonic myth, and the white dogs with red ears of Arawn.t which are included in the treasures! of Britain.

the prose Edda that she was promised by King Gylfit of Sweden as
much land as she could plough in a day and a night, upon which she ploughed up a large piece with her giant oxen and dragged it over to
Denmark. The kinship of Freyat with the giants is shown by the fact that one of her names was Gef(jo)n.

Ghul. In pre-Islamic myth female jinnt opposed to travel. The male of the species is the Qutrub.t From Ghul comes the modem word ghoul. They were cannibals, and often appeared to men in the desert, and, occasionally, prostituted themselves to them.
Giants. Mythology and fable are full of stories of giants, and it is felt that these may be divided into two groups. The first group, of which the Jotunnt are typical representatives, is composed of people who are slightly taller and larger than the tellers of the stories, in the manner that a Scandinavian may seem a giant to an Italian. These differences are merely of a racial character and do not necessitate more than the interminglings of peoples at the time of the great migrations.

One of the boundaries of the Egyptian Elysian Fields. Horns. Drinking and hunting horns are listed under Treasures.t Horses of the Aesir. To the northern peoples the difficulty of securing horses as opposed to ponies must have been very great, as is shown bv the specific mention by name of all the horses that occur in the Eddas.t In the following are listed twenty of them: Alsuid, Arvar (the sun god), Blodighofi, Falhofnir, Gardrofa (dam of Hofvarpnir), Gils, Gladr, Glaer, Gultopprf (the horse of Heimdalt), Gyllir, Hamskerpir (sire of Hofvarpnir), Hofvarpnir (the horse of Gnat), Hrimfaxi (the horse of Nottf), Lettfeti, Silfrintoppr, Skeidbrirnir, Skinfaxi, Sleipnirt (the horse of Odint), Svadilfari, Synir.

Another difficulty arises from the habit of the ancient Egyptians of combining two or three gods into dyadic or triune deities, which was frequently done with Amonyf Horus, Osiris, Ptah,t and Ra. The more important manifestations of Horus were: i. Horus the Elder, or Haroeris,t a falcon-headed sky god, of pre
dynastic origin, who may possibly have been the high priest or ruler of a tribe having a falcon totem. The story of his fight, as god of the sun, god of day, god of light, god of life and of all good, with Set, as 96



jjotei Hottentot
god of night, god of darkness, god of death and of all evil, was already
current in the earliest dynastic periods. According to this, Horus had two eyes, the sun and the moon, of which Set managed to steal
the sun, but was attacked by Horus, who inflicted a deadly wound
in one of his thighs. Thoth,t acting as mediator, made a treaty between them, allotting the day to Horus and the night to Set, and making them of equal length. Set, however, continued to persecute Horus, by cutting off pieces from his other eye, the moon, for a fortnight in each month, until there was none of it left. Thoth managed to frustrate him by making a new moon each month.
This is an interesting earlier variant of the Osiris-Set conflict, and seems to relate to a dispute between two sun and sky gods, Set having been a sun and sky god originally, combined with memories of some cosmic event of great import. Horus the Elder was known by many names, including Aroueris,t Horn Ivhent an Maa, Heru Khent Khat,t Heru Khuti, Hern Merti, Herunub, Heru Sam Taui, Heru Ur, etc.
2. Horus of Edfu, or Horbehudet.t A war god of Edfu, whose deeds were commemorated on the walls of the temple there.
3. Horus on the Horizon, or Herhkhty.t A manifestation of Ra, the sun god, on the horizon, i.e. the rising or setting sun. 4. Horus the infant sun god, who was reborn every morning, and was also a manifestation of Ra. 5. Horus the Child, or Harpakhrad.t The son of Isis and Osiris, who is usually shown as being suckled by his mother. He was conceived when Osiris had been brought back from the dead by Isis, a point which later allowed Set to oppose his claim for the throne of Egypt. 6. Horus the son of Osiris. He is sometimes shown as a man with a falcon’s head, wearing the double crown. He was the avenger of Osiris, and as such protagonist in the battles with Set, where we have another version of the story of the loss of an eye, only here Thoth brought it back and restored its sight by spitting on it. Horus then gave the eye to Osiris, who ate it and became filled with vital powers sufficient to enable him to take over the kingship of the dead. 7. Harpokrates. A son of a Horus god and Rat Tanit.t May be another form of Horus the Child, one of the Mendean Triad.t
Hotei. Japanese god of laughter and contentment. He is usually depicted as being extremely fat and carries on his back a linen bu.^ (ho-ki) from which he derives his name. He is one of the seven divinities of luck, the Shichi Fukujin.t

I
Goddess * I.’ Usually presumed to be the Mayanf water goddess, represented in the Dresden Codex as holding an inverted earthen

In Siouxt myth the son of the sun god who was expelled from heaven by his father for deceit and trickery and who is considered by the Sioux as ‘the father of lies.’ The stories told of his disputes with the beaver, the flying squirrel, the kingfisher, and the musk-rat, all totems of the Sioux, show that he was always defeated
by them, and he was probably a culture hero of some tribe whom the Sioux absorbed in the course of their history.
Iduna. The story of the Apples of Iduna which preserved the life and health of the Aesirf in Nordic myth may be a reverse side of the stealing of the Apples of the Hesperides by Hercules. They also seem to have formed part of the treasures of the Tuatha de Danann,t
for whom they were stolen by the sons of Tuirenn.f The tale of their theft, as told in the Conversations of Bragi,t is as follows : Lokit was kidnapped by Thiassit and obtained his release by promising to deliver Iduna into the hands of Thiassi. He enticed Iduna into the forest by saying he knew where she could obtain better apples
than her own. On entering the forest she was kidnapped by Thiassi. Without their daily supply of apples the Aesir grew old and grey, and it was only when they were at the point of death that they discovered what had become of Iduna. Under threat of punishment Loki was ordered to bring her back and, making use of the feather cloak of Freya,t he flew to the home of Thiassi and
rescued Iduna. He was pursued by Thiassi to the outskirts of Asgard,t where he was killed by the Aesir. Iduna, about whom
little is known except for her guardianship of the apples, was the daughter of a dwarf,t the wife of Bragi,t and one of the Asynjor.t IOI

He may be equated to Ilf or Ilah.t

Inca Creation Legends. As the Incas were comparatively late arrivals in Peru, being the last of a whole series of pre-Columbian cultures, their Creation Legends are scanty in the extreme. Several of them are centred on Tiahuanaco,! where there are monolithic structures of great age far outdating the Incan culture. Here it was believed that both men and animals had been created, and the two mother goddesses of the lake, Mama Cochat and Copacati,! appear to have been connected with this. Later Titicaca became a centre of sun worship to which pilgrimages were made. In common with many other American races the Incas tell of a time when humanity sought refuge in a cave known as Pacarit from wliich came the founders of the Inca culture. Another story is that of Ataguju,! from whom descended Guamansuri,! the father of Apocatequilt and Piguerao.t Finally there was the mother goddess Mama Pacha,! from whom originated Pachacamac,! the earth god.

Initiation Ceremonies. These ceremonies, no matter from what part of the world they originate, have' a tendency to resemble each other in outline. There are usually three stages: Katharsis, corresponding to baptism; Paradosis, corresponding to confirmation; and Epopteia, corresponding to ritual death and rebirth. The first two of these still exist in the Christian Church. The third stage, that of rebirth, is the period of meditation and temptation which all the great religious leaders of the past have had to undergo: Buddha sitting under the Bo-tree, Christ spending forty days in the wilderness. In many ceremonies the third stage included passage through a ring of fire, as with Brynhild,t Menglad,! and Skimir.t Innana. Early Babylonian mother goddess who later became merged in Ishtar.t She was also known as Ninni.t Both terms appear to have been generally applied to pre-diluvial goddesses.
Invisibility. Garments and rings producing invisibility are listed under Treasures.!
Io. Abstract supreme being of the Maori and the Polynesian peoples. In Tahiti the name is Iho-Iho or Io-i-te-vaki-naro. The resemblance to Iao, a name of Jupiter-Zeus, may be a coincidence. The fact that Io had receded into the background seems to show that he may have been an early god or culture hero of these races who was already in process of being displaced when they first arrived in the Pacific.
Ioi. Sister of Blue-Jayt in the Creation Legend of the Chinookst and participant in many of his adventures.
Ioskeha. In the Creation Legend of the Huront Indians, Ioskeha and Tawiscara,t his twin brother, were the founders of the human • race after Ioskeha had defeated the Great Frog which had swallowed all the waters of the earth. He brought to mankind the art of making fire and was the initiator of Huron culture. As a later development he and his brother became gods of the dayand of the night respectively. They are the equivalent of Enigoriot and Enigohatgea.

Iroquois Indian Creation Legend. In the myths of the Iroquois tribes Athensic,t the ancestress of mankind, fell from heaven into the waters of the Deluge as it was receding and she found herself on dry land wliich soon became a continent. Later Enigoriot and Enigohatgea, the twin brothers, began to organize life again, and when the Iroquois migrated to the Land of the Stone Giants,t their enemies were overcome by the efforts of Hinun,t the thunder god, and his brother the West Wind. One of their later culture heroes was Atatarho.t In another version of the story the twins are named Ioskehat and Tawiscara,t as in the Huron Creation Legend.
Irra. In Babylonian myth a plague demon who at the instruction of Allatu,t Queen of the Underworld, tormented Ishtart when she visited it to find Tammuz.t
Ishtar. The Babylonian goddess of fertility. Her cult was first recorded in Erech, but probably started much earlier and spread to the whole of the Middle East, and even to Greece. On the Mediterranean coast she appears as Ashtart,t but without alteration of her essential characteristics. She was adopted into the pantheon of many races, and appears as the consort of Marduk,t Asshur,t Tammu7.,t and even as Ninlil,t consort of Enlil,t the storm god. She has also been identified with Damkina,t wife of Ea,f in which ' capacity she is the mother of Tammuz.t She was sometimes considered to be the daughter of Anut or of Sin,t while Frazer equated her with the Esther of the Old Testament. The story of her descent into Aralu,t the Babylonian Hades, to bring back Tammuz,t is told on a tablet in the British Museum. When she arrived at the gates she found them shut, and threatened to break them down to free the dead and to devour the living. On hearing this Allatu,t Queen of the Underworld, gave orders for her admittance. After performing the customary rites, which consisted in the removal of part of her dothing and ornaments at each of the Seven Gates, she arrived naked in the region of those ‘whose bread is dust, whose food is mud, who 1 105

see not the light, who dwell in darkness, and who are clothed like birds in apparel of feathers.’ Allatu mocks her and orders Namtar,t the plague demon, to smite her with disease from head to foot. (This is obviously the description of an initiation ceremony in one of the early mysteries.) During her absence from earth, all fertility is suspended for man and beast. Shamash,t the sun god, receives the dread news through Papsukal.t He consults Ea and Sin, and Ea creates a being called Ashushu-Namir who is sent to Allatu to demand the release of Ishtar in the name of the Great Gods, a demand which Allatu could not refuse, so Namtar was ordered to bring Ishtar forth and to sprinkle her with the Water of Life. She was then conducted back through the Seven Gates and her garments and jewels returned to her. On her coming back to earth, life resumed its normal course. Ishtar occurs several times in the Epic, as befits the importance of her role as chief of the Igigi,t or spirits of heaven, and as the enemy of Gilgamesh. At some stage she absorbed Anunitumt and Nina.t She was the evening manifestation of the star Venus. With the Semites, the name was spelt Astarf or Istar.t
Isis. See Book of the Deadf; Egyptian Religion.t Egyptian goddess, daughter of Gebf and Nut,t sister and wife of Osiris,t sister of Nephtyst and Set,t and mother of Horus the Child.t One of the Ennead.t Although Isis, who was the prototype of the good wife and mother, is usually considered in relation to the myth of the murder of Osiris by Set, and her struggle to put her son Horus on the throne, in actual fact she would appear to have been a goddess in her own right, and possibly even before Osiris. Her magical powers were shown when Set caused a scorpion to sting her son Horus, and she managed to avert any evil result by reciting certain spells. On another occasion, when Horus and Set were fighting and had assumed the forms of huge black bulls, she was sufficiently powerful to slay them both. She could transform herself into any kind of creature, and travel through earth, air, fire, and water with ease. On one occasion, however, she wras defeated by Horus, who was so infuriated with her for releasing Set after a battle in which he had been captured that he cut ofi her head. Thoth,t however, magically changed it into the head of a cow and reattached it to her body. This myth arises from the identification of Isis with Hathort in some localities, and also from the fact that she was under the care of Hathor in the swamps of the Delta when rearing Horus. The lament which Isis and Nephtys were said to have sung after the death of Osiris was the official Egyptian funerary dirge. The worship of Isis spread far and vide, and images of Isis were found in
many parts of Europe. With the advent of Christianity these were 106

dozen in 1939. In the same manner there was a Black Aphrodite in
Cyprus. _
On one occasion Isis desired to know the secret name of Ra.t This
she accomplished by collecting his saliva and forming it into a
poisonous snake, which caused Ra to become very ill when it bit him. As Ra had not created the snake, as he had the rest of the world, he
was unable to remedy the ill. Isis promised to cure him if he told
her his secret name, by which she would become all-powerful. The god tried to avoid the issue by telling her his other names, but to no
avail, and at the end he had to tell her and ‘it passed from his bosom
to hers.’ Isis was known by many names, including Aset,t Aust,t Eset,t
IIest,t Mert,t Selkit,t and Unt.t
Isis, Mysteries of. Egyptian religious ceremony which became widespread over the Mediterranean area, and which was still being performed in the sixth century a.d. They cover the death and resurrection of Osiris,t and the liiding of his coffin in a tree trunk at Byblos, from which Isis excised him. The best description is in Plutarch’s Dc hide et Osiride.

Jagan-nath. In Vedic myth a vast idol, without legs, and having only stumps for arms, stated to contain the bones of Krisna,t which stands at Puri in Orissa, India. The peculiar shape of this monstrous image may be due to its being the irisida of a Buddhist tope, erected about 250. b.c. The term Jagan-nath means ‘Lord of the World/ and festivals are held in his honour, particularly in Puri, where as many as two hundred thousand pilgrims assemble for the occasion. At the Rath-yatra held in the month of Asarha, the temple car containing the images of Krisnaf and other gods is drawn through the town.

Jinn. In the pre-Islamic Arabian mythology the jinn were living beings of superhuman kind. They were not pure spirits but were corporeal beings, more like beasts than men, usually represented as hairy or having some animal shape. Their bodies were solid, but they had a mysterious power of disappearing and reappearing, or even of assuming human form. It should be observed that jinn are not recognized as individuals; the Arab says ‘the Ghul appeared/ not ‘a Ghul appeared’; with the advent of Islam, the term jinn became applied to many of the pre-Islamic gods. Four hundred and twenty species of jinn were marshalled before Solomon. The jinn of the Arabian Nights, who have distinct personalities, would appear to be later additions. According to Mohammedan tradition, the prophet assigned the healthy uplands to the believing jinn and the fever-haunted lowlands to the unbelieving. There were five orders of jinn: the Marid,t the most powerful; the Efritt ; the Shaitant ; the Jinn ; and the Jann.t The development of this hierarchy appears to have arisen from the necessity of accommodating several groups of pre-Islamic gods in the pantheon of evil
as represented by the jinn. There were also other jinn who fitted

The land of the giants was known as Jotunnheim and its chief city was Utgard.t It was a snowy region on the outward shores of the deep ocean, known to both the Aesir and the Vanir.t The fact that in the Eddast it says, ‘The golden age lasted until the women of Jotunnheim corrupted it,’ shows that intermarriage must have been fairly common, which is confirmed by the giant women in the Asynjor.t

Kalevala Kalpa
Kalevala. The Finnish national epic, which resembles the Hero of Estonia.t It was first put into book form in 1835 by Elias Lonrot. It consists of fifty cantos, called ‘ runes,’ and apart from a recital of the adventures of the various participants gives an account of the Creation of the world corresponding to those of the Nordic races. It also includes details of a cosmic disaster affecting the moon, causing high tides and earthquakes in the land of the Finns. The wars in which the heroes were involved were those of the Great Migrations and the period of resettlement. It is possible they may have been the Frost Giants,t the enemies of the Aesir.t For further details see Aino,t Ilmarinen,t Ilmatar,t Joukahainenyf Kaukomieli,t Kullervo,t Lemminkainen,t Vainamoinen.t
Kali. In Vedic myth the wife of Siva.t Kali also appears in the following forms: Ambika,t Anna-Purna,t Bhavani,t Durgha,t Kamashi,t Kumari,t Sati,t Uma,t Vijaya.t As Kali, the goddess of time, she is usually depicted dancing through space. She has four hands, and her garment is draped with human heads. In one hand she holds a sword; in a second hand a freshly severed human head; the third hand is raised in a gesture of peace; and the fourth hand is grasping for power. At her feet lies the body of her husband, on whom she has trampled in her frenzy. She would appear to be an early war goddess who was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon as the creator or mother of Siva, whom she subsequently married. Her other names are doubtless those of goddesses who have been treated in the same cavalier fashion. Her worship is usually accompanied by sanguinary rites. She was the titular goddess of the thugs. She has also given her name to the fourth Yugat of the current Mahayuga,t having a length of 1,200 divine years. Calcutta, or Kali-ghat, was named after her.

x Mahayuga = 4 Yugas = 12,000 divine years
1 divine year = 360 human years The Hindu obsession with big numbers makes these figures very suspect. As mentioned elsewhere, if the 12,000 divine years of the 114

11,500 B.c. Kalu. Babylonian priests ministering to Enmesharra,t a god of the underworld.

Karliki. According to Russian tradition, when Satan was expelled from heaven some spirits fell into the underworld and, becoming dwarfs,t were given this name ; others became the Lychiet of the woods. This explanation seems to be an attempt on the part of Christian missionaries to discount the stories of the old gods of the Slavs.

Later, when Marduk
created man out of ‘ blood and bone, ’ Kingu was named by the gods as a sacrifice for this purpose as a punishment for having fought against Marduk. He was seized and, after being fettered, ‘they inflicted punishment upon him and let his blood,’ from which Eat

Their children were Ama-Terasu,t Tsuki-Yumi/f SusaNo-0,t and Kagu-Tsuchi,t and from them was descended the roval line of Japan.

Kuksu
Krita
Bhagavads. It is possible that the story of his overthrow of the tyrant Kamsa has a factual basis ; the remainder of thelegends about Krisna are probably myths of earlier heroes which have been incorporated into his story in the process of making him into a god. The Vishnut worship which grew up about Krisna may have been the result of an attempt to foist a sectarian god on the Vedic peoples by identifying Krisna as the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Details as to the manner in which Vasudevaf was brought into the picture are given under the relevant entry. The legends of Krisna’s boyhood among the cowherds of Brindaban arise from his confusion with Gopala, a cowherd god of the nomadic tribe of Abhiras, who migrated into India about the first century A.D., bringing with them the worship of a boy god and legends of the massacre of the innocents.

Those who went away never returned, whilst the couple who remained were the ancestors of the Lithuanians. The third version says that after being saved the old couple were past the age of child-bearing. Pramzimas advised them to jump nine times over the bones of the earth.

British river god. His Irish equivalent, Nuda,t was known as
Argetlam.t
Lieu Law GyiTes. Early British culture hero who may be con
sidered to be the same as the Irish Lugh.t He was the son of
Arianrhodt and Gwydiont and the grandson of Dont and Beli.t The story of how he got his name, his arms, and finally his bride, in
spite of his mother, as told under Blodeuweddt (the Flower Maiden), is probably that of some early form of initiation ritual. The parallel pedigrees of Lieu and Lugh are as follows:
Don, wife of Beli or Danu,t wife Ceithlennt or Danu,t wife of Bile of Balorf
Arianrhod, wife of Gwydion,t the Ethneyf wife of Mackinely,t or brother of Govannont Cian,t the brother of Gavidat or Goibniut

It is possible that King Lear of Shakespeare is to some extent based upon him.

Loki. In Nordic myth a culture hero who was one of the Aesir.f He was the son of Farbautif and the husband of Signy.t Although the stories of his activities in the Eddasf describe him as being beautiful, he would appear in fact to have been related to the dwarfs,t which is shown by the numerous occasions on which he acted as intermediary between them and the Aesir. The confused stories of these activities may arise from endeavours to fuse his identity with those of Lodehur, one of the original companions of Odin,t and Logi, a fire god mentioned in the Lay of Skrymir.t It may have been in this latter capacity that he destroyed the hair of Sif.t His role seems to have been that of a malicious Merlin,t and the word ‘Loki’ appears to have had the sense of Magus, certainly when it was applied to the ruler of Utgardt in the story of Skrymir. He is also mentioned under Aegir,t Brisingamen,t Draupnir,t Lokasenna,

Maat. In Egyptian myth a goddess associated with Thoth,t Ptah,t and Khnemut in the Creation.

As the daughter of Ra,t a lady of heaven, queen of the earth, mistress of the underworld, she sat in the Judgment Hall of Osirist to judge the dead, wearing in her hair a large upright feather (maat) as the symbol of justice (as can be seen in the Anhai papyrus in the British Museum). She it was who ordered the daily course of the sun, and was with Ra when he first appeared from Chaos.f Maat is probably one of the first pre-dynastic mother goddesses, and was so enthroned in the hearts of the early Egyptians that no incursion of male gods or of new contestants for that rank could disturb her.
Mabon. In Welsh myth a great hunter who had a wonderful hound and rode on a steed swift as the waves of the sea.

Magi. A non-Aryan, possibly Turanian, tribe of professional magicians, astrologers, and priests, established in western Persia before the advent of the Iranians, and certainly before that of Zarathustra.t The Wise Men from the East, mentioned in the New Testament, were probably of this tribe, as was Zoroaster,t the Magian. After the development of Mazdaismf the Magi held a similar position to that of the Levites, in that they alone had the ritual knowledge necessary to slay the victims, to prepare the sacred IIaoma,t and to hold the Barsom (the bunch of fine tamarisk boughs). The words magus and magician constitute a presentday tribute to their legendary powers.

Mahabharata. In this colossal epic poem of 220,000 lines is contained the background of Vedic myth. The pre-Brahmanic version of this work may be dated to 500 b.c. or even earlier, and the eighteen books into which it was eventually assembled may be taken as covering the period of the Great Migration when the IndoGcrmnnic tribes were advancing southwards into the Indian mainland and driving out or enslaving the aborigines. Naturally, the work has suffered severely from the censorship of the Brahman 131



Maha-Deva Maitagarri

destroyer of all things. The feminine aspect of this is Kala. How Siva and his wife Parvatit became Kala and Kalit is not clear.

These persons were known as ‘ Vue ’t and were potent as givers of life, being full of Mana.
Manannan. In Celtic myth the son of Llyr.t the sea god
of the Celts.

At some later date the first ruler of the newly emerged island was Rangi,t who called himself the grandson of Rongo.t although this relationship is improbable.

its similarity to the Babylonian story of Oannest the Fish God. It may have been acquired from the Dravidians. The battles with

Owing to the destruction by the Spaniards of the vast majority of the Maya codices and the reluctance of the survivors of the Spanish excesses to assist them in any way it has been a matter of great difficulty to equate the pictured representations of the gods in the codices with the main deities of spoken myth. In order to get over this Schellhas decided upon an arbitrary naming of the more important gods occurring in the
codices with the letters of the alphabet. The series goes from A to
I and from K to P. Although other unidentified gods have been found the series was not extended any further.
Maya Creation Legends. Owing to the destruction of the entire literature of the Mayas, with the exception of a few codices which no one has been able to interpret successfully, the myths of the Mayas have largely passed into oblivion.

Mithra Mithraism
Ata.t She was defeated in battle by Ngaru,! who caused a deluge
which put out the hot fires on which Jliru had intended to cook him.
Mithra. Mithra, or Mitra, first appears as a god in the Vedic Hymns, where he is mentioned some hundred and seventy times.
He would appear to have been a human being who became elevated
to divine rank after his death, which occurred before the Aryans reached India. In the Rig-Vedaf he was one of the twelve Adityas.t
With the development of the Hindu religion into Brahmanism the figure of Mitra gradually vanished. The Persians, however, made him one of the Ameshast as the ‘ genius of Heavenly Light.’ He was the chief of a heavenly host of Ahura.t whom he led against the evil forces of the Devas.t In the reform of the Mazdean religion arranged by Zoroaster,! Mithra was reduced in status from the rank of Amesha to that of Yazata,! where he stood between the opposing forces of good and evil, always willing to assist in the saving of souls. There is a speculative possibility of his being related to tuctru, the Assyrian word for rain, as the firmament of Genesis appears in most of the mythologies of the Middle East. The worship of Mithra is always associated with the killing of bulls. Whether this is related to the passage of the sun from Taurus to Aries in 2350 b.c. or to the suppression of the bull cult at Minos is not possible to say. The transmission of the worship of Mithra to Rome and western Europe is dealt with under Mithraism.t In the Zoroastrian Creation Legends,! Yimat was told to build a var, or shelter, for the preservation of humanity. Later, however, this became the vast grotto prepared by Zoroaster! in the Persian mountains in honour of Mithra. This grotto contained the symbols of world elements and zones, the north entrance being that of life and the south that of death. This story seems to give the foundation for many of the religions of caverns which spread as far as Britain in the times of the Romans and possibly has its origin in a period when large numbers of the human race had to seek shelter against cosmic disaster in caves. It is possible that the dolmen and the socalled passage graves are linked with this.
Mithraism. The worship of Mithra! was introduced into the
Roman world from Cappadocia. By the time of Xerxes I it had spread into Greece, and by that of Pompey the Great it had reached
Rome. It was an aesthetic religion of truth, purity, and right for
men only—women worshipped Cybele. It was divided into seven grades : the raven, the gryphon, the soldier, the lion, the Persian, the courier of the sun, and finally the eagle or father. The doctrine and
mysteries became slightly modified in their passage from Persia to
Rome, and included a form of baptism. The great power was
Zervan Akarana,! or Aeon. It was a Dualistict religion with good 143

Mixtec Indian Creation Legend. In the myths of this tribe it is told how the Wind of the Nine Serpents manifested as a bird, and the Wind of the Nine Caverns (Gucumatzf) manifested as a winged serpent, caused the waters of the Deluge to subside, and land appeared. The fact that the Nine Caverns are mentioned shows that this tribe took refuge at the time of the Deluge in a cave rather than on a mountain top.
MJ olnir. Tne Crusher, the hammer of Thor,t which may also have been a thunderbolt. To use it Thor had to wear iron gloves and a belt to increase his strength.

Moloch. In the Semitic countries Malek,f or Melek, was, and still is, the common term for king, and as such was applied to their gods. The Jews, however, from religious dislike, inserted the vowels of boshetk. meaning ‘shameful thing’ (which presumably is still with us in the word bosh). This addition to Mlk produced Moloch. The Moloch of the Old Testament may have been the Baal(H)Ammon of Carthage, who is represented as an old man with
ram’s horns, holding a scythe, and to whom small children were
sacrificed until after Roman times.

Morgan Mywnoawr. In Celtic myth the possessor of a chariot which would take the user wherever he wanted to go. This vehicle, which was one of the treasuresf of Britain, would appear to have belonged to Manannan,t who was known in Wales as Manawyddan,t an alternative rendering of Mywnoawr.

The daughter of Nutt and Ra,t sister and wife of Set,t sister of Isist and Osiris,t and mother of Anubist by Osiris, a member of the Ennead.t The lament which she uttered together with Isis after the death of Osiris gave them the title of the Weeping Sisters. While she has been overshadowed by her sister Isis, there is no doubt that she also was a great magician in her own right, and that she knew the words of power used to raise the dead; because of this she was considered as a protector of the dead in the Book of the Deadt and in the great body of Egyptian myth. It seems fairly certain that, as with Isis, she was one of the mother goddesses of early pre-dynastic Egypt, and that their being linked together as members of the family group with Osiris, Set,t and Horust came at a later date when, perhaps, their ranks and titles were those of the priestess queens of early Egypt.

A Teutonic fertility goddess, mentioned by Tacitus, who participated in the biannual fertility festivals and whose temple was in a sacred grove on a Baltic island, possibly Seeland.
Although she corresponds to Jordt her ritual—particularly the fact
that both the goddess and her chariot had to be washed in a sacred
lake by slaves who were subsequently drowned—recalls the worship of Svantovitf on the island of Riigen. In later times she becaiqe known as Hertha.t Nessa. In Celtic myth the mother by Fathacht of Conchobart who obtained for him the throne of Ulster from her lover Fergus.t

He also defeated Amaite-Rangi.t He defeated Tumu-I-TeAre-Toka,! the sea monster. Nibelungenlied. The various stories based on the theft of the treasure of the Nibelungs are so interwoven into Nordic, Teutonic, and Anglo-Saxon myth that it would appear probable that there
may have once been an actual treasure, the loot of many campaigns, at one time in the ownership of the Aesir,! which brought with it the legacy of murder, treason, and betrayal which accompanied all such hoards before the institution of bankers’ strong-rooms. That the great heroic tragedies of the past should have been linked up with 152



Nichant Ninib
the existence of such a treasure is a legitimate device, but in practice the adventures of Sigurdt and Brynhildt should be considered
separately from the treasure. A comparative table of characters in the various stories is given below: Alberich,t Andvari,t Brunhild,! Brynhild, Fafnir,t Gudrun,! Gunnar,t Gunther,! Gutrune,! Hagen,!

Nichant. In the Creation Legend of the Gros Ventre! Red Indians he was the god who destroyed the world by fire and water.
Nick. The 'Old Nick’ of popular English fable would appear to be a male variant of the Teutonic Nixe.t The lake, river, and well priestesses! of Europe being female, he is in all probability a fairly recent development. The Nickard mentioned by Aubrey as stealing children may be of the same origin.
Nicor. Alternative spelling for Nick! or Nixe.! Nidim. Early name for Eaf in Babylonian myth.
Niflheim. The description in Nordic myth of Niflheim as a place of mist, cold, and darkness seems to have been based on the experience of hunters, or raiding parties, who were caught by winter in the frozen wastes of the Arctic. Here was to be found Hvergelmir,! the fountain.

Ninib had a temple at Caleh, mentioned in Genesis x. 12 as having been built by Ashur.t He was also a god of storm and of fertility. He had two consorts, Gulaf and Bau.t In Girsu, Ninib was known as Ningirsu.t It was here that the festival of his marriage to the goddess Ba’ut was held. An alternative spelling of his name is Adar.t Ninib is also called Enurta.f Ninigi. In Japanese myth grandson of Ama-Terasu.t He ascended to the throne on the abdication of Onamuji,t the son of Susa-No-O.t He brought with him to the throne the three symbols of Japanese imperial power, the jewel, the mirror, and the sword.

Nirvana. In Buddhism! the state of release from the bondage of Karmaf and rebirth where desire and lust have ceased to have power and no renewal of existence trill take place after death. To gain Nirvana was the goal which the Buddha set before his followers as a supreme end to their efforts and longings.

Nisaba. ‘Goddess of Wisdom,’ a title given to Ninlil,t the Babylonian goddess. 154



Nithud Norns
Nithud. In the Volundar Kvidat the King of Troy, and the father of Bodvild,! who was seduced by Volund.t Nixe. In Teutonic myth the priestesses of the lakes, rivers, and wellst were known by this name. Wormius thought that the
' Wasser Nixe’ fabled to have been seen as late as 1615 may have
been the Nickard of Aubrey, which used to steal children. The Grisly Waterman of Spenser’s Faerie Queen would appear to have been of this family. Another kindred was Nanto-Suleta,! as was also 'Old Nick.’ Nizir. Chaldean name for the landing place of the Babylonian Ark. Further details will be found under Babylonian Creation Legends.! Njord. In Nordic myth he was a giant! who was one of the Vanirf and at the conclusion of the war with the Aesirf was sent to them as a hostage. There he married the giantess Skadi,! the daughter of Thiassi,! and became the father of Frey! and Freya.t It is possible that he is a masculine form derived from Nerthus (Jord),t the earth mother goddess. In the list of zodiacal houses! his residence is given as Noatun, which comes under the sign of Libra; both of these would belong rather to Forseti,! the dispenser of justice, who comes under the sign of Virgo. It seems that when Njord displaced Jord it was considered inappropriate to allot to him her mansion and her sign of the zodiac and that he was given the next one in sequence.
Nodens. A river god of the Severn estuary who had a temple at Lydney Park. There is considerable confusion between him and the Ludd! of Ludgate Hill, and Nudat the Celtic hero, and it is possible that they were all one and the same. He seems to have displaced Tamesis.t Nootka Sound Indians. The chief god of this tribe was Quahootze.t
Nordic Creation Legends. The story of Ragnarok,! although given in the form of a prophecy, appears to be that of some great natural disaster as seen by early man in northern latitudes. Apart from this, the world is assumed to have started with a vast ocean of chaos, with mist and cold to the north, and fire or volcanoes to the south. Ymir,t the giant, was killed by the sons of Bor,! and from his body the world was created. From his blood came the great flood.
Among the survivors were Bergelmirf and his wife, who escaped in Nnglfart ; Ask! and Embla,! who escaped in a canoe and were rescued by the sons of Bor, who escaped by some other means. There is also a story of the lowering of the strand lines around the northern coasts, told under Skrymir,! and of a lunar disaster, told under Bil.t The story of the repopulation of the world is given under Rig.!
Norns. The Nordic fates : Urd,t the past : Verdandi,! the present; Skuld.t the future. Some were said to be descended from the

Nortia Nunbar-Segunnu
In fact they would appear to have been a college of sibyls at Asgard,! of which perhaps the Valkyriest may originally have been students. The custom of wandering wise women casting the fates of children appears to arise from this. Later they appear as the weird sisters in Macbeth and as the godmothers in the fairy stories. They may originally have been the guardians of the sacred fountain at the foot of Yggdrasil.t The Noms were also known as Disar, Sing, Dis.t
Nortia. Etruscan goddess of fortune.

Nuda. King of the Tuatha de Danannt whose sword from Finiast was one of the treasures! of the Tuatha. He lost his hand in battle with the Firbolgs.t Because of this infirmity he was deposed and replaced by Bress/f son of King Elthant the Fomor.f However, Miach,! with the aid of his sister Airmid,! fitted him with a silver artificial hand and he regained his throne afterwards, being known as Argetlam.t He may be considered to be the same as Luddyf who also lost his hand. Although Tiwt or Tyrf had a similar deformity there does not appear to be any connection between them. Machaf was reputed to be one of his wives. Nudd. In Britain Nuda,t the Celtic culture hero, was known sometimes by this name instead of Ludd.t Nudimmud. AlsoNidim.t Early name for Eat in Babylonian myth.

He is of a similar type to B-Iame,t Bun-Jil,t Daramulum,t Nurelli,t and Mungan-Ngana.t
Nusku. Assyrian fire god, best known by a series of eight tablets in the British Museum, in which he is referred to as the offspring of Anu,t offspring of Shamash,t first-bom of Enlil,| etc. His symbol was a lamp. He was also known as the son of Sin,t the moon god, and was sometimes equated with Nabut and Gibil.t
Nut. Mother goddess of Egypt. Sister of Shut and Tefnunt,t wife of Gebt and mother of Osiris,t Set,t Isis,t and Nephtys.t One of the original Heliopolis Company of Gods. At first she personified the day sky and Nautt the night sky. She is usually represented with her hands and her feet on the earth, the curve of her body being the arch of the sky or, perhaps, the Milky Way, and her limbs the four pillars of the firmament. In the very beginning the sun is said to have raised her up to support the sky, but another story has it that she gave birth to the sun, who passed along her back or across her body on his journey. At Heliopolis she had a sacred sycamoretree, at the foot of which Apept was slain by Ra.t Legend has it that she was born at Denerah and that the birthdays of her five children were the five intercalary days {see Osiris). She played an important part in the underworld, where she provided fresh air for the dead. She is also equated with the Celestial Cow, later sup
planted by Shu,t to whom a calf was bom every morning to be sent across the sky. There are several versions of the story. In one her husband was Nu,t in another he was Ra,t while in a third she was the mother of Khensuf by Amon.t She was akin to Mehueret.t

Goddess ‘ 0.’ An elderly mother goddess of the Mayas,t possibly a goddess of the home.
Oannes. In Babylonian myth the god of wisdom, said to be the father of Semiramis.t Berosus considered Oannes, who was half man and half fish, to have brought culture to mankind, which may indicate an early conquest of Babylonia by a sea-going people. Later he was equated with Ea.t See also Matsyaf.
Oa Rove Marai. Culture hero of the Makeo people of British New Guinea.t
Obatalla. Yorubat heaven god in opposition to Odudua,t the earth goddess.
Odherir. The magic cauldront of Nordic myth. It was originally one of three belonging to Suttung,f the giant,t the others being Bodn and Son, and in it was brewed the intoxicating mead of the Aesir.t It was first used when the peace treaty between the Aesir and the Vanirt was implemented by both sides spitting into the cauldron. When Kvasir/f who was in charge of the cauldron, was murdered by Fjalarf and Galar,t his blood was mixed with the honey mead and fermented to give an intoxicating liquor which gave wisdom, the knowledge of runes and charms, and the gift of poetry in a similar manner to the Somat of the Persians and the Vedas. The story of how Odint stole the secret of its manufacture is told under Gunnlautht and of the subsequent theft of the cauldron by Thort under Aegir,t Bragi,t and Hymir.t It was also known as Eldhrimir.t
Odin. In Nordic myth the elder son of Thort by the giantess Besla.t He was one of the slayers of Ymirf and with his two brothers Wilif and Wet participated in the Nordict Creation myth. As leader of the Aesirt he gradually displaced Thor, who was the representative of the peasantry, while Odin was the hero of the warriors. His title of ‘Allfather’ was probably a move to confirm him in this position. Odin was a god of the dead, of cunning, of poetry, and, on occasion, of wisdom. He had originally been chief
of a raven clan. He was not renowned for prowess in battle unless 158



Odudua
backed up by Thor and Tyr,t but was the inventor of tactics. In
Ilagnarokt he died in conflict with Fenrir.t In some measure he resembled Thoth,t the Egyptian god of learning; the story of his ‘catching up runes’ after having hung for nine days on a gallows
tree pierced with a spear, may relate to some form of initiation ceremony in the same way as his pledging one of his eyes to Mimirt for a draught of wisdom from Odherir,t the magic cauldron. His throne, Hlithskjalf; his two ravens, Huginf and Munint; his horse, Slcipnitt; his sword, Gungnirf; his ring, Draupnirt were all favourite
subjects of northern folklore. Like Haroun A1 Rashid, Odin delighted to mix with his people in disguise. Snorri, in the Prose Edda and in Ynglingasaga,t postulated the existence of Odin as an historical personage, an assumption which seems to have in it a distinct element of probability, although it should be observed that the various king-lists built up on this basis are probably wildly optimistic. It seems fairly certain that Odin was the chief of one of the most powerful groups of early Scandinavian settlers. He is the Wodent of the Teutons. Gladsheimyf the castle at Asgard.f was his zodiacal house,t but this
would appear to be a later development.

The name may possibly be derived from Orongot or Rongo.t In Tahiti the king by virtue of his coronation ceremony became an incarnate god.

His houses became the Ao-Roaf or clouds of heaven, his canoe became Anuanua, the rainbow, and when he travelled he was never described as journeying but only as flying. He was also the Marai of Opoa in Raiatea, where he was said to have originated. 2.

Osiris. See Book of the Dead. Egyptian Religion. The story of the life and death of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the dead, and chief member of the Ennead,t is, probably, the most important contribution which the ancient Egyptians made to the general body of religious myth. Osiris was the son of Nutt and Rat or of Nut and Geb,t the brother and husband of Isis,t and the brother of Nephtyst and Set.t Before the birth of Osiris, Ra w'as so infuri162



Osiris Osiris
atcd at the faithlessness of Nut that he decreed that her children should not be born in any month of the year. Thoth,t however,
gambled with the moon for a seventy-second part of the day and eventually won five days, which were added to the Egyptian lunar year of 360 days, thus enabling not only Osiris but his four brothers
and sisters to be bom out of any month. The addition of these days, known as the Epactyt to the year in connection with the birth of Osiris, shows that it was at this time that the adjustment of the
calendar took place. Later, when Osiris had grown up and married Isis, he was known as a wise and beneficent ruler, who spread civilization throughout Egypt and the surrounding countries. This aroused the hatred of his brother Set, who plotted his murder. This was accomplished by secretly obtaining the measurements of Osiris, and making a special coffer to fit him. On the occasion of a banquet he offered to present the coffer to whomsoever it fitted. On Osiris taking his turn, the lid was slammed dowrn and sealed, and the coffer thrown into the Nile. The waters of the river carried it as far as Byblos, a town in the papyrus swamps of the Delta. It came to rest by a tamarisk-tree, which grew' around the coffer, enclosing it. After a long search Isis obtained possession of the coffer, but during her absence it vfas discovered by Set, who cut the body of Osiris into fourteen pieces which he scattered in the marshes. Isis recovered the pieces and reassembled them, and by the aid of Thoth brought Osiris to life again for sufficient time for him to beget the infant Horus.t Alternative versions say that the fourteen pieces were buried where they were found, or that they were reassembled and
made into a mummy. After this—in all the stories—Osiris became
ruler of the kingdom of the dead, Amenti,t the Land of the West.
When he came of age, Horns claimed the throne of Egypt, but this was opposed by Set on the grounds that he was illegitimate, owing to the method of his conception. Ra favoured Set, who was a sun and sky god, and the trial was reduced to a succession of combats between Horus and Set, in which, by the aid of magic, they both assumed the forms of wild beasts of various kinds. In one episode, where they were both black bulls goring each other, Isis lulled them both. The council of the gods, however, failed to come to any decision, and Osiris sent a letter pointing out that he was the creator of the barley, on which both gods and men lived, and that for this reason his son should be declared the winner. This also brought no result, so finally Osiris resorted to threats and told the council that he would
send savage messengers to fetch the whole Ennead to the nether world unless they declared in favour of Horus. To this they finally agreed. Other aspects of the conflict are given under Horus, Isis,
and Set, the Book of the Dead, and Egyptian Religion.



Ossian Ouranos
In the myth of Osiris we seem to have the history of a king of predynastic Egypt, interwoven with the ritual sacrifice of a barley god, and a conflict between two priest kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, perhaps for temporal gain or connected with the driving out of the oldersun and sky religion of Set by the newer one represented by Osiris. It has been authoritatively stated that 1 The evidence of Osiris as the source of vegetable life, as far as the Old Kingdom is concerned, must be admitted to be very scanty and indecisive, and is completely outweighed by the evidence testifying as to his kingly character.’ Frazer attributes a lunar origin to Osiris, as did Plutarch. This might explain the violence of the fight with Set. Over a period of several thousands of years the original conception of Osiris as a harsh god of the nether world was gradually modified to a point where the myth of his resurrection by Isis became the basis for the faith of the average Egyptian for a life beyond the grave. The linking of Osiris with Nephtys as the father of Anubist may be a late development. Osiris was called by many names, of which the following are the best known: Andjeti,t Asari,t Asartaiti,t Aus,t Unneffer,t Unno,t Wenneffer,t Winefred.t He may be equated with Heytau.t
Ossian. An Irish heroic poet, the son of Finn.t The Ossianic poems by James Macpherson which caused such a sensation in 1762-3 may now be accepted as a successful attempt to put into modem language a vast assembly of Gaelic myth which might otherwise have been lost.
Otos. Reason, in the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Damascius, child of Airt and Aura.t
Oulomus. In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Mochus he was engendered by Ethert and Air,t and himself produced Chousorus.t From him sprang the primeval egg,t which when broken gave rise to Ouranost and Gea.t Ouranos. This would appear to be a Semitic rendering of Uranus,
t
dating back to the period when efforts were being made to explain Semitic myth in Greek terms. In the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos he was the child of Eliount and Berouth,t the husband of Gea,t and the father of Baitulos,t Dagon,t Atlas,t Zeus Damarost and Pontus,t EH and Astarte.t In the Phoenician Creation Legend of Mochus, Ouranos and Gea were the two halves of the primeval egg.t Both of the versions fit in with the classical myth of Ouranos, the sky god, father of the Titans, including Cronost (the father of Zeus), the Cvdopes, and the Hecatoncheires. He was emasculated by Cronos, and from the drops of his blood falling into the sea sprang the Gigantes and from the foam Aphrodite. 164



Ousoos Oynyena
Ousoos. Giant son of Firet in Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos, and the first to make garments from skins; at enmity with his brother Hyposouranios,t who was the first to build cities. This enmity would appear to be founded on the traditional dislike of the pastoral tribes for the first town dwellers although analogies have been traced with the dispute between Aleiont and Baal.t
Oya. Consort of Shangoyf the culture hero and thunder god of the Yorubat tribe of Nigeria. She was the priestess of the Niger River.
Oynyena Maria. In Slavonic myth ‘Fiery Mary/ who was the counsellor and assistant of Peroun/f the thunder god. She may have been a fire goddess who later became submerged by the new thunder god.

Paehacamac. In Incat myth one of the four brothers who issued from Pacari,t the Cave of Refuge. His brothers were Viracochat

This was the second dynasty of ancient Ireland, the first having been that of Nemed.t Partholon was followed by the Firbolgsf and the Fomors.t
Parvati. In Vedic myth the wife of Siva,t in her aspect as a mountain goddess. The fantastic complications of nomenclature, caused by the desire of the Brahmans to symbolize all manifestations of goddesses as being wives of Siva, have led to all kinds of historical personalities being merged into this one entity. Other names under which she is known are: Anna-Puma,t ‘Full of Food’; Bhavanif; Durghaf; Kali,t ‘the Black One’; Kamashiyf ‘the Wanton-Eyed’; Kumari,t ‘the Damsel’; Satit; Uma,t ‘the Light of Wisdom’; Vijaya,t ‘the Victorious’; Vindhyavasini,t ‘the Bloody.’ Parvati was the mother of Ganesa.t

Peiroun. The hero of a Formosant Creation Legend. He was warned that when the faces of the idols Awunt and Infoniwoo! in a nearby temple turned red in colour there would be a deluge. One day this happened and he hurriedly boarded a ship just in time to see the island of Maurigasma, of which he was ruler, vanish beneath the waves. Pele. In Polynesian myth the fire goddess of Hawaii. There is a deluge legend associated with Pele, who is said to have poured out the seas around the Hawaiian mainland until all but the highest summits were submerged. Later, however, the water receded to its present level. In the West Indies the volcano of Martinique is named Pele, which may indicate a common origin.
Penard’un. In Celtic myth the first wife of Llyrt and the mother of Evnisien.t

Peroun. The Slavonic! thunder god, who gave his name to Thursday (Perendan), in the same manner as Thorf gave it to the
northern races and Orkot to the Basques. He drove across the sky in a fiery chariot launching shafts of lightning. He was also lord of the harvest, and, as such, may be equated with Perkunas.! At Novgorod a fire of oak wood was always kept burning in front of his effigy; the penalty for letting it out was death. In Serbia his name was given to the iris (peroon). He may have been brought as Thor by Scandinavian traders to the cities of Novgorod and Kiev. After the arrival of Christianity he was merged with the prophet Elijah (Ilya or Elias). He was assisted by Oynyena Maria.! In 168

Phoenician Creation Legends. There are four main versions of the creation legend of the Phoenicians (a) That of Sanchuniathon (eleventh century B.c.) as reported by Philo Byblos (a.d. 42-117): In the beginning there were Airt and Chaos,t from whom proceeded Windt and Desiref (Potost), who produced Mott in the shape of an egg.t In this were formed creatures which remained motionless and dormant until the egg opened, when from it were projected the sun, the moon, and the stars. Later under the influence of Light,! the waters were separated from the sky. The creation of man was not less complicated. From Kolpiat (the windt) and his wife Baaut issued Aiont (life) and Protogonost (first-born). Their children were Genost (race) and Genea, who were the first to worship the sun. Their descendants were Light,! Fire!, and Flame,t who discovered the use of fire. From Fire issued the giants, of whom Hyposouraniost was the first to build towns, while Ousoost was the inventor of garments made from skins. The first gods were Eliount and Berouth,! whose children were Ouranost (the sky) and Geat (the earth). From this pair sprang El,t Dagon,! Atlas,t Zeus Demarost (father of Melkartt), Astarte,! Baitulos,! etc. El later revolted against Ouranos with the aid of his brothers and sisters, a story which recalls the classical revolt of the Titans against Uranus with the aid of Gea. (b) That of Damascius (a.d. 480). Before all, there existed Chronost (time), Potost (desire), and Omiclet (mother of all). From the union of the two latter came Air! and Aura,! who in their turn produced Otost (reason). (c) That of Mochus, reported by Athenaeus (second century a.d.). The first principles were Ether! and Air,! who engendered Oulomos,! "'ho himself produced, first Chousoros,! and then the egg,! which when broken up gave rise to Ouranost and Gea.t (</) That of the Ugarit texts, discovered shortly before the Second
M orld War. Although these cannot properly be described as Creation Legends, the portions dealing with cosmological origins not being available, nevertheless they form a parallel to the Sanchuniathon story, having been written about the same time, and having the advantage of not being distorted to meet the demands of Hellenistic
* 169



Phoenix Piltzintecuhtli
abstract thought : El, the supreme god, lived in the Sad-Elt (Field of God) with Asheratiant (the Ashera of the Sea), who seems to have been the same as Elatt and may in actual fact have been the mother goddess who preceded El. In perpetual conflict with El is Baalt (the lord), maintaining the principle of Dualismt which is found throughout this area. The offensive in his conflict is not taken by Baal the younger and more vigorous god, but by El, who sets against his opponent various fabulous creatures including the Aquqim,t or Okclim,t which have huge horns and resemble Baal in appearance. Baal, wTho is attended by Ben Dagon/f is sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated, in which latter case he is sacrificed.
A similar, possibly later, conflict takes place between Mot,t the son of the gods (i.e. of El), and Aleiont, the son of Baal. At some stage in these combats Mot kills Aleion, and the world of nature suffers. Anat,t the sister of Aleion, goes to Mot and demands the restoration of her brother to life, but failing to secure this she carries out the sentence of death passed by the gods and cuts him in half with a sickle. Other portions of the story show Baal taking the place of his dead son and eventually killing Mot, while in yet another the eventual victory is given to Aleion. There are other conflicts between Mot and Leviathan,! who is the giant sea beast of the Bible. These combats, which seem to have been an annual event and to have involved the death of one of the parties, may have replaced the sacrifice of the agricultural god by armed combat between the representatives of two religious groups, in which the loser wTas the victim of the sacrifice. The story presents certain points of similarity with those that came later and doubtless it will be possible, in time, to disentangle
all the threads. A possible point of contact is the similarity betw-een Aleion and Tammuz.t
Phoenix. Name by which the sacred Bennut bird in Egyptian myth is best knowm. There is a kinship here with Roc,t the enormous bird of the Arabian Nights.
Piguerao. A name meaning ‘White Bird’ given by the Incas to the twin brother of Apocatequil.f Because of the veneration shown to these brothers twins were regarded by the Incas as sacred and as protected by the lightning wielded by Apocatequil. He w'as the son of Guamansuri.t

Tupi-Guaranit Indians, he was the son of Temiouat and was bom girdled with a star serpent, and subsequently became the constellation Orion. His sister, born with seven stars, became the

Polynesian Creation Legends. The Creation myths of the Polynesians show a marked similarity to those of Mangaiat Island, which should be consulted. Cognate information will also be found under Akua,t Ao-Kahiwahiwa,t Ao-Kanapanapa,t Ao-Nui,t Ao-Pakakina,t Ao-Pakarea,t Ao-Potango,t Ao-Pouri,t Ao-Roa,t Ao-Takawe,t Ao-Toto,t Ao-Whekere,t Ao-Whetuma,t Apu-Hau,t Apu-Matangi,t Avaiki,t Hawaika,t Hina,t Io,t Kiho Tumu,t Knpua,t Marae,t Matao-Anu,t Mate-Anu,t Maui,!

Pomo Indian Creation Legend. In the myth of this tribe of California Indians it is told that Marumdat lived in the north and decided one day to create the world and called in his elder brother Kuksut for assistance. After they had done so they were dissatisfied and decided to destroy it with a deluge, but this proved so disastrous that they themselves had to be rescued by Ragno,! the Old Mother. Again they tried to destroy the world, this° time by fire, and again they had to be rescued. Finally they created man, and the ancestors of the tribe built a ceremonial dance house and they taught the people to dance, then, having done this, they left mankind to its own devices. Another version tells how Dasant and his father Makila! came from the waste of waters and brought civilization to mankind.
Pontus. The Sea, one of the children of Ouranos! and Get in the Phoenician cosmogony, also a son of Gaea in the classic myth. In actual fact this would appear to be a Greek name given by Damascius

Pooka Potos
Pooka. A pre-Celtic god, possibly of the dwarfs,t who was eventually degraded until he became a goblin,t the Puck of English literature.
Popul Vuh. The Creation Legend of the Quichet Indians, was fortunate in having escaped the destructive efforts of the Spanish conquerors. It may be said to be a reflection of the myths, not only of the Mayas,t but to some extent of the Aztecs,t and is of considerable assistance in arriving at an interpretation of certain of these. The name means ‘The Book of Written Leaves,’ and it is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the creation of pre-diluvial man, his destruction by the wrath of the gods, by flood and by fire. There is also a section in this part dealing with war of the gods against the giantst but this seems to have got out of place as the personnages concerned, Hun-Aput and Xbalanque,t are only bom in the middle of part two. Some of the stories about Blue-Jayt resemble those in the Popul Vuh. Part two tells the story of the death of Hunhun-Aput and VukubHunapuf at the hands of the rulers of Xibalba,t the Cavern World of the Quiches,t and the avenging of these deaths by Hun-Aput and Xbalanque.t The third part deals with the arising of present-day man and his origin in Tulan-ZuiVa.t In common with the myths of many of the American tribes the Popul Vuh is vitally concerned with caverns, and it would seem that at some remote period of natural disaster the ancestors of these races were forced to live in caves as places of refuge for several generations. The adventures of the brothers in Xibalba appear to relate to initiation ceremonies carried out in these places. Other references mentioned under Camazotz,t Chimalmat,t Gucumatz,t Hun-Apu,t Huncame,t Hunhun-Apu,t Hurakan,t Tohil,t Tulan-Zuiva,t Votan,t Vukub-Cakix,t Vukubcame,t Vukub-Hunapu,t Xbalanque,t Xibalba,t Xmucanet and Xpiyacoc, and Xquiq.t Porentius. In Slavonict myth an alternative name for Porevit,t the five-headed Slavonic god of the island of Riigen, quoted by Saxo Grammaticus, who says that he had four faces to the cardinal points and one on his chest.

Purusha. In Vedic myth the male half of Brahmat as opposed to Satarupa,t the female half. Purusha has also been described as a primeval giant from whose dead body the world was created.

R
Ra. i. The first appearance of tills Egyptian sun god is as the grandson of Ratt and son of Nutt over whose arched back he travelled each day, dying at dusk as an old man, and being reborn at dawn. At a later stage in religious development he superseded his grand
mother and was depicted as sailing the skies in his celestial boat by
day, and as combating the powers of evil in the Tuatt by night. He is also associated with an early catastrophe legend in which he was a ruler who sent forth Hathorf and Sekhmett to destroy his rebellious subjects, but after they had partially done so and were wading in their blood, he repented and caused the goddesses to become intoxicated and cease from slaughter; he then withdrew to the Tuat, or Fields of Peace. Although he is a typical sun god, the above legend would indicate that he had been linked with an earthly ruler in whose reign occurred a cosmic disaster followed by a flood. Whether his worship or that of Hathor was originally accompanied by blood sacrifices cannot be said, but there appears to be no record of this in dynastic times. The boat and the nightly combat with the powers of darkness are among the attributes of typical solar gods. There is also a sun god of the same name in the Pacific Islands. Ra was one of the Enneadf in the Heliopolis company of gods, and as such the father of Osiris,t Isis,t Set,t and Nephtyst by Nut.

Ragnarok. The Doom of the Gods in Nordic myth. The story as told in the Voluspaf and also in the Prose Eddat is assumed to have been a prophecy, but it would rather appear to be a faint
memory of some great natural catastrophe of the past in which the majority of the Aesirt were destroyed. It began with seven Fimbul 1 winters, i.e. with a severe frost, piercing winds, and no warmth
from the sun; these were followed by a period when ‘Brethren were each other’s bane, an axe age, a sword age, a storm age, a wolf age, ere earth met its doom,5 which reads like the onset of an ice age.
the sun is obscured by the wolf Fenrir,t the earth trembles, the sea

rushes over the earth, and on it floats the ship Nagalfarf bearing the last of the frost giants! with Hrymt or possibly Bergelmirf as their pilot. Surtt leads the Host of Muspelt against the Aesir,! breaking down the Bifrostf Bridge. Heimdalf sounds Gjallar,! Odin! rides to the well of Mimirf for advice, Yggdrasilt shakes, and the Aesir arm for battle, led by Odin brandishing Gungnir/f his magic sword. Odin is killed by Fenrir, Thor! fights Jormungard,! the Midgardt serpent, Frey! stands against Surtt and is killed for lack of his sword
;
Garrnt the moon hell-hound breaks loose and kills and is killed by Tyr,t while Thor, although victorious over the serpent, dies from its venom. Vidarf kills Fenrir, Lokif and Heimdal kill each other. Then Surt darts flame over the world, most of which is consumed. The only survivors are Vidar and Valit and the two sons of Thor,
Modit and Magni.t A Balder! and a Hodurt are also mentioned as survivors but these are probably titles and not proper names.
Men appear again on the earth, the sun has a daughter—which
may possibly mean a new body in the solar system—a new golden age begins, and the dragon of darkness is banished. The story appears to be that of some great natural disaster as seen by early man in the northern latitudes. The battle may have been the last despairing struggles of tribes, or even races, fighting for safety and existence. It combines a planetary myth with both deluge and fire myths, and belongs to the great Creation myths of the world.

Setebos Seyon
Osiris, and the uncle of Horus.! He appears to have been a predynastic ruler of a tribe having an animal similar to a pig as its
totem, and worshipping a sky and sun god. Associated with him was the Divine King, who was ritually slain, possibly by fire. His position as a sun god is shown by the fact that in the stories of his legal dispute with Horus for the throne Ra always took his part, while on several occasions Isis also did so, even against Horus. That Set was the ruler of Upper Egypt is seen from the final judgment of Thoth,! who awarded Upper Egypt to Set and Lower Egypt to Horus. The application of the principle of Dualism,! however, caused his original position as a sky and sun god to be forgotten, and for him to degenerate into the chief of the powers of evil, as manifested in the serpent, Apep.f In spite of the defeat of this early religion by new ideas from the settled Nile Valley to the north, the cult of Set existed as late as the nineteenth dynasty, when its followers were known as Typhonians and were said to be identified by the redness of their eyes. While the main story of the conflict is given under Horus, Isis, and Osiris, some additional light is given by the division of the stars between Set and Horus, Set taking all the circumpolar stars, i.e. those which never set, and Horus those which rise and set like the sun. To watch over Set, the four sons of Horus, Amset,t Duamutef,! Hapi,t and Qebhsneuf,! were given places in the Great Wain or Chariot of the Gods, in the constellation of the Great Bear. Set, who was a member of the Ennead,t was equated with Baal!; he was also known as Sati,t Sit,t Sut.t
Set was also a chief god of the Hyksos, which explains why—after
their departure—he was degraded to the position of lord of the
powers of evil, and had his name erased from many monuments. There is a possible reference to Set in the Siriadic Columns! of Josephus.

Hotei,! and Jorojin.f This pantheon of one goddess and six gods, which originated in the seventeenth century, appears to have been a means of securing a niche for popular divinities, many of non-Buddhist origin, who could not be accommodated within the official framework of Buddhism.
Shi-King. The third of the nine authoritative works on Confucianism.! The name means 'Book of Odes/ and the 305 lyrics contained within it were selected by Confucius from a collection of 3,000 covering a period of at least a thousand years up to 775 B.c.

The grandson of Kola, Ukwa,t took as wives two river priestesses, and was the ancestor of the race. The present kings still take the title of Jo-Uk.
Shinto Creation Legend. Details of such Creation Legends as are furnished by Shintoism are given under Koji-Ki.t Their paucity frmy possibly be due to the necessity of casting off the myths and legends brought from the mainland by the original Japanese emigrants in order to provide support for the doctrine of the direct descent of the Mikado from Izanagit and Izanami. As the position of the Japanese militarists became affected by the western world, more and more absurdities were introduced into official Shintoism in order to bolster up the military clique. This process reached its apex
in the Second World War and has since fallen off considerably. For further details see Aizen My5-o,t Ama-Terasu,! Amida,! Benten,! Bimbo-Gami,! Binzuku,! Bishamon,! Daikoku,! Dainichi,! Ebisu,!

When the Tuatha de Danann? were defeated by the Milesians? some of them stayed behind and to each of them Dagda,? who remained behind as their ruler, assigned a barrow or hill on which they appear to have buried their dead, a fact which may be the origin of the assumption that they were ghosts.

Slavonic
Skrymir
Skrymir. A king of the giantsf in Nordic myth. In the Prose
Eddat it is told how Thor,t accompanied by Lokit and Thjalfi,! after
various misadventures arrived at Utgardf to visit King Skrymir, who
had the title of Utgard-Loki, which may be taken to mean the
Mams of Utgard. Thor and his companions undergo a whole series
of mystifications culminating in a series of matches at the giants’ castle, when Loki is defeated at eating, Thjalfi at running, and Thor himself had failed to empty a drinking horn in three draughts, to lift more than one leg of a cat from the floor, and to win a wrestling match with an old woman. The following day on their departure
Skrymir explains that Loki was defeated by Logi—meaning fire;
Thjalfi by thought; that the drinking horn was connected with the sea, and that Thor’s prodigious draughts had lowered the sea levels
around the northern coasts—a matter which is referred to in Nordic
Creation Legendst; that the cat was Jormungard,! the Midgard serpent, the lifting of whose leg had caused vast earthquakes all over the world ; while the old woman was Elli,t or old age, with whom no
one could struggle. When Thor in a fury at having been deceived turned round to strike the giant, everything disappeared.

Slavonic Creation Legends. It has been said that 'of all the Aryans, the Slavs were the race that remained nearest their original home, and were thus the last to enter history,’ nevertheless, the fact remains that with the exception of a few Slavonic gods, traces of which have been found outside Russia, there is but little to recall the glorious mythic past of the Slav peoples. They had an island paradise, Bouyan,t on which was Alatuir,t the magic stone, and Zarya,t the beautiful priestess. The Slavs had Vilas,t or sibyls; vampires! and werewolvest; a series of multi-headed gods: Porevit,! Rugievit,! and Svantovit.t A remnant of the dualistic system persisted in Bielbogt and Czarnobog,t the white and black gods. The four great pre-Christian gods were Da-Bog,! Khors,t Peroun,t and Stribog,t whose statues stood in the castle at Kiev. There was a fertility goddess, Perchta,t whose feast was celebrated as late as 1941, as was the Feast of Shadows.! The Slav heaven, Svarog,! resembled the Vedic Swarga.t The southern Slavs, having withstood the onslaught of Islam, had their Byess, Djin,t Dyavo,t and Syen,t all due to Arab influence. Their name for God was Bog,!
which came from the Sanskrit Bhaga.t The fact remains that the impact of Christianity on an almost completely illiterate population, resulted in the destruction of the majority of the old myths and their substitution by emasculated versions for the converted.

Sleeping Princes. The story of a prince and his retinue who sleep in a cavern awaiting the clarion call to serve their country is a common feature of European myth. The prevalence of these stories is doubtless linked with the early custom whereby on the death of a ruler the principal members of his court were killed and buried with him in order that he should have his retinue in the other world. Instances of this are given under Alfatin,! Barbarossa,! Ercildoune,! Marco,! Mullaghmart,! The Seven Sleepers,! Stoymir,! and Wenceslas.!

Agni,! the divine fire, was the spirit of Soma,! and the effect of pouring libations on the altar fires was to enable the god to combat the forces of darkness and to maintain the order of light. In some versions Soma is an actual being, but this is a later variation similar to that by which Kvasirf came into being in order to explain the origin of the Nordic Kvas. It appears to have been brewed from wild rhubarb. Eventually Soma became identified with the water of life, and as such linked with the moon. It is identical with the Haomat of the Zoroastrian faith. Amrita! of the Churning of the Ocean! may be an earlier name for Soma. Also consult Grail.!

Susa-No-O. Japanese sea and storm god. His name may be
translated as ‘ Impetuous ’ or may possibly derive from the town of Susa where he had a shrine. He was the son of Izanagit and Izanami and the brother of Ama-Terasu,t the sun goddess, by whom he begat eight children. He was also a moon god and there is a myth of his having driven his sister, the sun, into ‘ the cave of the heavens,’ leaving the world for some considerable period in darkness.

Sut(ekh). i. A Hyksos god worshipped in Egypt in the fifteenth and sixteenth dynasties, and identified with Set.t 2

Svantovit. A Slavonicf god of the island of Riigen in the Baltic. Saxo Grammaticus states that he had four heads on four necks with a bow in the left hand and a drinking horn in the right. Close by, in the sanctuary, were a bridle and saddle destined for the white horse
of the god which the priest alone had the right to mount. No one but the priest could enter the sanctuary and, as with the Parsees, he had to hold his breath while sweeping it out. At the annual festival the quantity and condition of the wine which had been poured into the drinking horn at the previous festival was taken as an augury for the next harvest.

The fourth month of the year was named after him, Du’uzut (June). The story of the descent of Ishtart to Hades, to bring back Tammuz, is told under that heading.

Tanit Tatum en
Yates, and had taught his brother Rongo the arts of agriculture, his mother Papa objected when it was proposed to make him lord of all they possessed because, as parents, they would not dare touch the food or property of Tangaroa, the eldest by right. In this manner she managed to secure all for his brother, her favourite, and Tangaroa had to leave his beloved island for Rarotonga and Aituitaki, visiting mam* islands on his long journey, and scattering everywhere the
blessings of food piled up in his canoe. He is the Tangaloa of Samoa. The story is one of a migration following a tribal dispute over religion.

Taoism. The religious philosophy of the Chineset thinker and mystic Lao-Tsze appears to have been founded in the sixth century before our era, some fifty vearspriorto Confucianism,f and has decided resemblances to the Ideas of Plato. The fundamental work on the principles of Taoism attributed to the master himself is the Tao-Te
Ching, ‘the Treatise of the Way and of Virtue.’ The obscurity of this work suggests that it may be compiled from fragments saved at the time of the burning of the books. The other important work is contained in the writings of Kwang-Tsze, written some two hundred years after Lao-Tsze. Taoism is a system of moral teaching based on high ideals and at some later stage allied itself with the ancient cosmological doctrine of Dualismt known as the Yangt and the Yin.t

Thor. In Nordic myth Thor was the son (or husband) of Fjorgyn/f or Jord,t or Hlodyn,t and of the husband of Sift or Jarnsaxa.t His father was said to be Odin.t These domestic complications arose out of the endeavour to fit Thor, who was a culture hero and preceded the Aesir,t into the framework of a pantheon to which he did not belong. He is akin to Donar,t the thunder god of the Teutons, but it is by no means certain that they were the same. Thor, who was strong, brutal, with gross appetites, was the culture hero of a people on a far lower stage of civilization than the Aesirt or the Vanirt and was more akin to the giants,t with whom he was per
petually at war. He was famous for his hammer and his belt of power, named Mjolnirf and Megingjardirj for his chariot, and for his iron gauntlets, all of which formed part of his personal accoutrements. He was in essence the hero of the thrall and the churl as opposed to Odin,t the god of kings and earls, or fighting aristocracy.



Thoth Thrym
He had all the virtues of his class and all their vices. Bravery,
strength, endurance were offset by stupidity, brutality, and bluster. The fact that he survived until the advent of Christianity is in all
probability due to these very reasons and the consequent appeal which he had to the lower classes. Marriages, burials, and civil
contracts were hallowed by the blacksmith’s hammer of Thor as at Gretna Green. He was also known as Atli.f Thor’s mansion was named Bilskinir. From him we get our Thursday. For stories of
his activities sec under Alvis-Mal,t Harbard,t Hymir,t Skrymir,t and Thrym.t Thoth. One of the earliest Egyptian gods, represented as ibisheaded or as a dog-headed ape. He is reported to have invented numbers and arithmetic, geometry and astronomy, all of which were well known to the pre-dynastic Egyptians. For the story of his gamble with the moon for the intercalary days, see Osiris.t One
of his manifestations was Aah-Te-Huti.f He was associated with IChncmUjt Maat,t and Ptaht in the Creation. Alternative spellings arc Djehutit or Zehuti.t He was the arbiter between the gods, and had knowledge of the magic formulae needed by the dead to pass safely through the underworld. In the stories of the conflict between Osiris,t Isis,t and Horust against Set,t it was Thoth on whose advice a satisfactory outcome always depended. Thoth, who was a moon god, dates back to the earliest times, and was of such influence that he had to be absorbed into the religion of Osiris and Ra.t For further details see Book of the Dead,t Egyptian Creation Legends,! and Siriadic Columns.! Thoth has been compared to many foreign culture heroes and gods, including Ikto.t
Thoume Kene Kimfe Cacounehe. Creator god of the Natchez! Indian Creation Legend. He created first men, then tobacco, and then women.

in the Eddas.t and may involve some kind of relationship.
Thrym. The Eddie! Thryms-Kvida, or Lay of Thrym, also
known as Hamarsheimt, ‘the Homecoming of the Hammer,’ tells
how Thrym the giant! stole Mjolnir,! the hammer of Thor,! and hid it underground. Lokit borrowed the feather cloak of Freyat and
visited Thrym, who told him that the hammer would only be
returned if Freyat came to him as his bride. The news of this so 209



Thunar Tiamat
infuriated Freya that Brisingamen,t her great necklace, fell to the ground. The Aesirf went into council and Heimdalf suggested disguising Thor and sending him in place of Freya. Thor objected but was persuaded by Loki, who accompanied him as the bride’s attendant. On arrival the supposed bride ate an ox and eight
salmon, and drank three casks of mead. When the wedding was to
be consecrated with the hammer—the traditional marriage rite

Thor seized it and murdered not only Thrym but all his womenfolk, including his aged sister, who had asked for a gift from the bride. If, as one may presume, the war between Thrym and Thor, of which the above is a version, resulted in the defeat of Thrym, it would explain why Thrymheim, his castle, was allotted to Skadit as a residence, and later became her zodiacal house.f
Thunar. The thunder god of the Anglo-Saxons, who may be equated to Thort as being essentially a god of the people rather than one of the military aristocracy. The Teutonic equivalent was Donar.t
Tiahuanaco. The vast area of cyclopean ruins, several square miles in area, at Tiahuanaco, a few miles from the shores of Lake Titicaca, 15,000 feet above sea level, are those of a civilization which was already extinct when the first Incas arrived in South America. Although the ruins are now over thirteen miles from Lake Titicaca, the existence of wharfs and docks shows that at some remote period Tiahuanaco must have been a thriving port on a vast inland sea, some 350 miles from north to south, situated in the Andes. The mystery of this culture has baffled investigators for years. The great monolithic gateway of the temple of the sun is the largest example of its kind in the world. The rows of figures which decorate this gateway have been interpreted as constituting an ancient calendar. The god to whom this temple was built may have been Mancocoapac,t or Viracocha.t Temples also existed here to Copacatit and Ka-Ata-Killa.t When the Spaniards arrived in Peru they were told by the Incas that in the ancient days when there was no sun but only the moon and the stars, there lived a race of giantst who built palaces and temples at Tiahuanaco. To them came a prophet who proclaimed the coming of the sun. The children of night, however, did not believe him and stoned him. Nevertheless, the sun rose and under its rays the godless race all perished and their bodies petrified into colossal blocks of stone. Another version says they were punished for having sacrificed to the moon goddess, Ka-Ata-Killa.
Tiamat. A name given to the mass of bitter waters and the female principle in the seven Assyrian Tablets of the Creation, in the British Museum, as opposed to Apsu,t applied to the sweet waters. From the fertile depths of Tiamat sprang every living thing. The 210



Tiawath Tithonos
waters were confined in a vast bottomless mass. The term is cog
nate with the Tohut of the Hebrews; the Tauthet of Damascius the
Syrian, and the Thalatht of Berosus, all of which may be alternative
readings. At a later stage Tiamat became the mother of Mummut by Apsu,t the three forming a primeval trinity having no goodwill
towards the higher and newer gods brought in by later generations in the development of religious thought. Further mention will be
found under Benani,t Ea,t Kingu,t Marduk,t Melili,f Ummu
Khubur,t and the Babylonian Creation Legend.! An alternative
spelling is Tiawath.t
Tiawath. Variant of Tiamatt in the Babylonian myth.

In Wiltshire there is a Tan Hill, now known as St. Anne’s Hill, while in other places the word has become confused with St. Anthony, whose festival corresponds with the mid-winter fire festival. But Tan Hill at the head of Wensleydale is still so called. The word also occurs in Beltainet the fire festival. To the Etruscans he was the power who spoke in the thunder and descended in the lightning, and was always represented on monuments with a thunderbolt in his hand. As chief god of the Etruscans he employed three thunderbolts, the other gods only having one each.

In view of the importance of the rainy season to Aztec economy the place occupied by Tlaloc may be appreciated, but it is difficult to understand the necessity for the large numbers of children who were sacrificed to him every year, as the climate was not subjected to any great variations, unless these were in order to prevent a repetition of the Deluge or some kindred disaster associated with the early myths of this god.

Tuat Tulan-Zuiva
Tuat. The Egyptian nether world—also known as Amentif

of wliich Osirist became ruler after the defeat of Set,t was originally a place where there was neither water nor air and as dark as night, where it was not possible to gratify the cravings of affection. It was divided into twelve parts, which corresponded to the hours of the night. In shape it was rectangular, surrounded by water and intersected by streams, through which Rat travelled nightly in his boat. It was the typical paradise of the desert dweller; its development from its first stage seems to imply that the original idea came from a non-desert country. The modem version of the name, Dwjt, is considered by some to be related to the name David. There is an oasis of that name in the Sahara. See Book of the Dead.t
Tuatha de Danann. The folk of the god whose mother is Danu.t In Celtic myth these were the fifth wave of migrants to Ireland following the Firbolgst and the Fomors.t Being the latest arrivals they appropriated to themselves most of the qualifications of good, leaving to their predecessors the powers of evil. After a long succession of battles they defeated the Fomors at Mag Tuireadhf with immense slaughter on both sides. Eventually they themselves were defeated by the Milesianst and most of their leaders retired to the sea islands from which they had come. The original names of these were Falias.t Finias,t Gorias,t and Murias,t but after their return to them, however, the names became changed into HyBrasil,t Mag-Mell,t and Tir-nan-Beo.t The main culture heroes of the Tuatha were Bodb,t Dagda,t Diancecht,t Goibniu,t Llyr,t Lugh,t Nuda,t and Ogma.t The reason for their defeat by the Milesians may have been the great cost of their earlier victory over the Fomors. In Britain they were known as the Children of Don.f
Tuirenn. In Celtic myth the father of Brian,t Iuchair,t and Iucharbar, the murderers of Cian/f the son of Diancechtt and the father of Lugh.t As a penance for this crime they had to bring to the Tuatha de Danannt a series of objects most of which are listed under Treasures! of the Tuatha.
Tuisco. A Teutonic culture hero who according to Tacitus was the father of Mannus, from whom sprang the three principal Germanic tribes: Ingaevones, Hermiones, and Istaevones. The

In the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the Popul Vuht this place, known as ‘the Seven Caves,’ was where the ancestors of the race started life after the extinction of the first race by fire and water and where they received their gods Avilix, Hacavitz, and Tohil. It resembles the Chicomoztoct of the Aztecs
and maybe Xibalba.t 216



Tuleyone Tupi-Guarani
Tuleyono Indian Creation Legends. This tribe of California
Indians have two fire and deluge myths. In the first Sahte,f the
evil spirit, set the world on lire and 011e,t the Coyote,t caused a great
flood which put the fire out. The survivors were those who sought
refuge on the Conocti Mountains. In the second version Wekwek,t
the falcon, having stolen fire, carelessly dropped it on the world, which
was set ablaze. Here again it was put out by Olle.
Turn. Alternative spelling of Nefertumf or Atmut in Egyptian myth.
Tumu-I-Tc-Are-Toka. In the myth of Mangaiaf a sea monster who was defeated by Ngaru.t The name means ‘the Great Shark.’

the tribe.
Tupan. In one of the Tupi-Guaranit Creation Legends Tupan or Tupi was one of four brothers who alone survived the Deluge.
Tu-Papa, or Tu-Neta. Youngest daughter of Papa,t the great mother of the gods of Mangaia.f She married Ra,t the sun god of Raiatea.
Tupi-Guarani Creation Legends. This group of Brazilian tribes have a series of Creation Legends presumably arising from a common
.
original, but which now differ considerably in detail. In one of these Monan,f being vexed with mankind, determined to destroy the world by fire, which was extinguished by a great rainfall caused by Irin Mage.t Another version of the story tells how the Deluge arose through a quarrel between Arikutet and Tawenduaret in which the latter stamped his foot so hard on the ground that a flood gushed forth, from which the brothers and their families only escaped by taking refuge in the tops of high trees. Yet another version, first reported in 1550, tells how Mairef endeavoured to destroy the world by a flood from which the three brothers Coem,t Hermitten,t and Kliment escaped by climbing trees or by seeking refuge in caves. The southern tribes speak of four brothers instead of three, and
name two of them as Tupan,t or Tupi, and Guarani respectively. Toruguenket,t the moon, figures largely as the power of evil which periodically falls on the earth and destroys it, and whose baleful influence is only slightly offset by Torushompek,t the sun, the
principle of good. An alternative rendering makes Guaracyt the sun, Jacyt the moon, and Perudat the god of generation, the three creator
gods. The Chaco Indians, a Guarani tribe, believe that a beetle
constructed the universe and also a man and woman, the ancestors
of the human race. When evil beings came from the hole in the
ground scraped by the beetle, it protected the humans against them. Q 217



Tupimare Twanyrika
This is presumably an account of a tribal war between people who had sought refuge in caves and those who had escaped on tree or mountain tops. The Mundruku tribe have a myth that the god Rainit formed the world by placing it in the shape of a flat stone on the head of another god, and that the mountains were formed by Karat by blowing feathers about. The Uapes Indians tell that Temiouat was the mother of Pinont and his sister, the constellation Orion and the Pleiades respectively. They also have a purely male god named Jurapari.t Others of the tribes believe the Southern Cross to be the footprint of an ostrich and the Pleiades to be a swarm of bees.
Tupimare. The name given to the hill-top on which the ancestors of the Karayaf and Ges Indians sought refuge from the flood which had been caused by Anatiwa/f who sent fish to attack the hill and the people on it. One of the survivors was Kaboi.t The story is given under Tupuyat and Ges Creation Legends.
Tupuya and Ges Indian Creation Legends. The Karayat tribe of this group have a culture hero named Kaboit (known to the Arawaksf as Kamu,t to the Caribst as Tamu,t to the Paraguayans! as Zume,t and to the Arovacst as Camut) who after the Deluge, when the ancestors of the tribe had sought refuge in a cavern, led them to the outer world, to which he was guided by hearing the call of a bird. In another version, Anatiwat haring caused the flood, the Karayas fled to Tupimaret Mountain and were saved thanks to Saracura,! the water hen, bringing earth to the hill-top as fast as the fish sent by Anatiwa nibbled it away. This story is shared with the Ges Indians. The Bakairi Caribs tell of their culture heroes, Keri and Kame,t who populated the world with animals after the disaster, having brought them in the hollow trank of a tree, which may be taken to be a dug-out canoe. The name Kame is a rendering of Kamu.t
Turan. An Etruscan fertility goddess who corresponded to Venus.
Tuttu. In Babylonian myth an alternative name for Marduk,t Tagtug,t Uttu,t and Ziudsuddu.t
Tvashtrl. In Vedic myth the artificer of the gods, the father of Saranyut and instructor of the Ribhus.t He is a very ancient deity who probably came to India with the first Vedic invaders. He is akin to the various European artificers, and may therefore have been
a dwarf.t He should not be confused with Visvakarma/t the architect of the gods, who was his son-in-law.
Twanyrika. In Australian myth the great spirit whose voice is heard in the bull-roarer, similar to the Orof of Nigeria. 218



Typhon Tzitzimime
Typhon. In Egyptian myth another name for Sett in the nineteenth dynasty.
Tyr. The most daring of the Nordic culture heroes, who is in some respects equivalent to Tiwaz.f He lost his hand in the first fight with Fenrir,t but there is no record of his having been fitted with an artificial one like Nudat or Luddf in Celtic myth. At the time of Ragnarokt he killed Garm,t the moon or hell hound, and died from his wounds. As was the case with Thor,t Tyr was a symbol of the viewpoint of the peasant and, as such, he was gradually pushed into the background by the more intellectual Odin.t Other details of the life of Tyr are given under Aegir.f
Tyrnog Diwrnach. A magic cauldron, one of the treasures! of Britain, which boiled meat for brave men only and not for cowards.
Tzenlal Indian Creation Legend. Details of this are given under Mayat Creation Legends. The chief characters were Alaghom Naum,t Iztat Ix,t and Patol.f
Tzitzimime. Minor Aztect stellar god. The name means ‘monsters descending from above, ’ and probably refers to meteors.

In their Creation Legend it is told how after all men had been destroyed by fire Titit split open a tree from which came forth people, including a beautiful maiden who subsequently married Ule. From this couple sprang the tribe of Anti Indians. The word ule now means a tree in the Yurukare language.
Ullur. The stepson of Thort and of Sif,t a member of the Aesirf and a minor hero of Nordic myth. His zodiacal houset was Ydalir.
Uma. In Vedic myth perhaps the most attractive aspect of Parvati,! wife of Siva.t She is depicted as of great beauty, and as signifying the life of heavenly wisdom. She was worshipped as a representative of lofty abstract qualities.

Urd (The Past). The chief of the Nordic Noms! or fates. While in some stories she is said to have sat at the foot of Yggdrasil! with her sisters Verdandi,! the present, and Skuldyf the future, in actual fact she appears to have been the titular leader of a college of sibyls at Asgard,! or else she is a memory of a trinity of mother goddesses such as those worshipped by Frisian troops on Hadrian’s Wall.
Ushas. In Vedic myth the goddess of the dawn, and the breath of life of the Vedas.!
Uta-Napishtim. Babylonian Noah, son of Ubar-Tutu, who was warned by Anki,! god of wisdom, of the intention of the gods to drown mankind, and to pull down his reed hut and make a boat or

Vafthrudni. In Nordic myth one of the wisest of the giants.f One day he was visited by Odin,t who had disguised himself under the
name of Gangrad. The two agreed to test their wisdom for a forfeit
and discuss all the various points on Nordic myth ranging from

Valhalla. In Nordic myth the name given to the great hall of the palace of Gladsheimt in Asgard.t It had a ceiling covered with spears and five hundred and forty gates through each of which
eight hundred men could march abreast. Allowing for pardonable exaggeration through the centuries, it seems that Valhalla was the ‘ Valaskjali,’ the house of Vali,t rather than the residence of Odin.t
It was here the Einherjart congregated.
Valhamr. Name of Feather Cloakt of Freya.t
Vali. In Nordic myth the son of Lokit by Siguna,t or by

223



Vanir
Valkyries
Valkyries. In Nordic myth the Valkyries were priestesses of Freya/f possibly dating back to the time when she was the supreme mother goddess of the Nordic race, or even providing a link with some Amazonian tribe of mounted women warriors. They are subor
dinate to the Nomst and if the assumption is that the Noms were
the chiefs of a college of sibyls, then the Valkyries may well have been their assistants, particularly as Skuld,t the Norn of the future, always rode with them. The function accredited to them in popular myth, of bringing the souls of the slain to Odin,t seems to belong to the later stages of Scandinavian religion. In the following are listed some of the Valkyries whose names are mentioned in the Eddasf: Brynhild.t Geirolul, Goli, Herfjotur, Hildur, Hlokk, Hrist, Judur, Mist, Radgrid, Randgrid, Reginleif, Rota, Skeggold, Skogul, Skuld, and Thrudur. Of these Judur and Rota belong to the Asynjor,t and Reginleif may be related to Regin the dwarf.t Valmiki. The author of the epic poem Ramayana.t
Vamana. In Vedic myth the fifth or dwarft avatar of Vishnu.t He ousted the demon Balit from the upper and middle worlds. Vishnut presented himself before Bali and solicited as much land as he could cover in three strides. When his request was granted he covered heaven and earth in two strides, but left Patalaf to Bali.
Vampires. The idea that evil spirits take possession of the bodies of the dead in order to prey upon the living and exist by sucking the lifeblood of their victims is common in the Slavt world and the Balkans. It would appear to be related to some primitive ritual of blood drinking. Vampires in general behaviour are not unlike ghosts as conceived by the Greeks in Homeric times. The assumption that vampires remained immune from corruption appears to be of post-Christian origin. The remedies, such as piercing with a stake and burning, and the use of sprays of garlic, are frequently mentioned in European folklore and myth, and in the records of
witch trials.
Van. In Armenian myth a feathered monster or dragon. Vanadevatas. In Vedic myth Indian tree spirits, who took revenge on those who cut down their trees.
Vanadis. In Nordic myth one of the names of Freyaf as a goddess of the Vanirt and also that of one of the members of the Asynjor.t

Vanir. In Nordic myth the Vanir were the culture heroes of a
race which seems to have preceded the Aesirt in Scandinavia. A
war between them was precipitated by the ill treatment of Gullveig,t 224



Vasuki
Vaotere
a Vanir giantess or priestess. After the defeat of the Aesir, peace
was made by both sides ritually spitting into Odherir,! the magic
cauldron of the giants (the story is told in the Conversations of Bragit), and by an exchange of hostages, Njordt going to the Aesir and Hoenit to the Vanir. Later the two groups were fused into one.
The Vanir would appear to have been a seafaring people, but pro
bably of the same stock as the Aesir, as Freyt and Freyat were the children of Njord, whilst Frigt and Friggat came with the Aesir.
Vaotere. In Fijian myth the evil spirit of the ironwood-trees was known by this name. Other relevant myths are given under
Polynesia.!
Varaha. In Vedic myth the boar, the third avatar of Vishnu,! in which he dived to the bottom of the sea to deliver the world from the dutches of Hiranyaksha.t This appears to be another version of the battle with Hayagrivaf in the Matsyaf avatar.

In Polynesian and Indonesian myth the great mother of gods and men who lived in Avild, the land of the dead ; the mother of Vatea.t who rules over the underworld, and grandmother of Tangaroa,! the sky god, and Rongo,! the god of the underworld, in the Mangaia! Island Creation Legend.
Varuna. In Vedic myth the god of the waters and of the west quarter of Mount Mem.! He is a Poseidonian god who is usually depicted seated on a sea monster, known as Makara. In his aspect as a heaven god he is akin to Ahura Mazda,! the benign divinity of the Zoroastrian myths. He was gradually superseded by Indra.f although an annual festival of Varuna was held in Bombay until
recently. He was an Aditya.! He was also a god of the Tamils.!
Vasishtha. In Vedic myth one of the seven great Rishis! and one of the Prajapatis.t He was the author of several hymns in the Rig-Veda,! and was victor in a contest with Viswamitra,! a fellow' Rishi. Vasishtha was the possessor of Nandi,! the Snow-white Bull of Siva.!
Vasudeva. In Vedic myth patronymic of Krisna.f At the start of the Christian era Vasudeva, being a sun god, had partially supplanted Ivrisna, the dark sun, who then took the name Krisna Vasudeva. Actually, Vasudeva would appear to have been a sage of the Satvata or Vrisni clan, who was later identified as, or whose name
was actually used by, the father of Krisna. Later the worship of a
dark god for various reasons became unpopular, and to counteract this Vasudeva was actually referred to as Devadeva or god of gods. Subsequently the doctrine of rebirth was used to make Krisna
Vasudeva, an avatar of Vishnu,! the Vedic sun god.
Vasuki. In Vedic myth a ruler of the Nagas,! the serpent-worshipping people, akin to Sesha.t
225



Vedic
Vasus
Vasus. In Vedic myth a group of eight divine attendants of Indra.t They are Aditya,t Antariksha,t Agni,t Chandra,t Dyu,t the NakshatraSjt Prithivi,t and Vayu. Another, and possibly earlier list, named them Apu (water), Dhruva (the Pole Star), Soma (moon), Dhara {terra, earth), Anala (fire), Anila (wind), Prabhasa (dawn), and Pratyusha (light).
Vatea. In the myth of Mangaiat Island the husband of Papat and the father of Tangaroat and Rongo.t Although he liked Tangaroa, he allowed himself to be persuaded by his wife, Papa, to dispossess him in favour of Rongo.
Vayu. In Vedic myth one of the eight Vasus.t Originally Vaya, or Vata, was the spirit of the wind, whose worship expired when the nature gods were superseded by Varuna,t Indra/f and others. He occasionally replaced Indra as a member of the triad with Agnif and Surya.t He was the father of Bhimaf and Hanuman,t and later was considered as the father of the Maruts.t
Vcles. A Czech variant of Volos,t the Serbian cattle god, who had been degraded to the rank of a demon, which position he still held as late as the fifteenth century.
Vedic Sacred Writings. These are arranged in four main groups: the Vedas, the Upavedas, the Ved-Angas, and the Upangas. The Vedas are subdivided into four: the Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Artharva, consisting of hymns of praise, sacrificial texts, Somat ceremonies, and magical spells respectively. The Upavedas deal with the sciences of medicine, music, war, arts, and architecture. The Ved-Angas deal with pronunciation, prosody and verse, grammar, phraseology7
, religious ceremonies, and astronomy. The Upangas include the itihasas, puranas, yoga, mimansa, dharma-sastras, and tantras, comprising epic poems, legendary7 histories, logic, philosophy, jurisprudence, and ritual. From the point of view of study of the myth, the most important sections are the itihasas, which include the Ramayanat and the Mahabharatat ; the puranas, in which most of the stories of the gods are to be found; the dharma-sastras, or code of Manu,t containing accounts of the Creation and of the background of Brahmanical tradition. The tantras, which represent an attempt to bring Brahmanism down to a level which would endear it to the aboriginal races, are largely pornographic and are of little value. Each subdivision of the Vedas is, in turn, divided into the following parts : Sanhita, comprising the Mantras and Ganas, or hymn ns and prayrers ; Brahmanas, describing the details of Vedic ceremonies
;
Jnana, or Upanishads, or philosophical part; and Aranyakas, ‘ belonging to the forest,’ intended for Brahmans in retreat. Closely 226



Veela Vidar
connected with the Vedas are the Sutras and Parisishtas, abbreviated summaries for the use of students.
This vast mass of religious writings dates back to before the
Hindus arrived in India, and probably to a period when they were
living in a relatively cold climate. The Vedic hymns were probably put into their present form before 1000 b .c. but have naturally
suffered certain modifications. Other details are in Hindu Creation Legends.t
Veela. In south-east Europe the Valat or Volva,t the sibyl of the north, became the kindly sprite of the woods, such as Oossood.t This is a typical example of the degradation of the priestess sibyl into the semi-human dryad, under the influence of religious pressure. They loved to dance, and fairy rings are to this day called Vilinio
Kollo in the Balkans. If disturbed while dancing—presumably
part of their religious rites—they were hostile to men, but they could,
nevertheless, be amiably disposed and help them. On occasions they married humans and bore children. Prince Markot received great help from a Veela named Raviyoyla.t They were gifted with second sight and healing properties of flowers and herbs.
Vegtam. The Eddat Vegtamskvida, the Lay of Vegtam the Wanderer, or sometimes known as Balder’s Dream,t tells how Balder, having been tormented with dreams of death, the Aesirf assembled in council and empowered Friggat to extract an oath from all things living that they would not harm Balder. Odin,t feeling that the precautions taken were insufficient, rode on his horse Sleipnirt to visit Hela,t there to consult the famous Volva,t whom he causes to rise up from her grave, only to hear from her that Balder was doomed to fall by the hand of Hodur.t This seems to be even older than the Voluspa,t which quotes several lines from it.
Vendidad. The first part of the Zend-Avesta,t the bible of the Zoroastrian religion, containing religious myth, laws, and the ‘gathas.’
Verdandi. In Nordic myth the Nornf of things present, who sat with her sisters Skuldt and Urdt at the foot of Yggdrasil.t The
Norns appear to have been a group of Volvast or sibyls, and the
titles given to the three sisters may well have been hereditary.
Verethaghna. In Zoroastrian myth god of war mentioned in the
Zend Avesta.t The title given to Indra,t the Vedic culture hero,
may have been taken from this. The assumption that it means
‘Slayer of Verethra’ seems to beg the question. ,He was one of the
Yazatas.t
Vidar. In Nordic myth the son of Odint by a giantess,!
known as ‘the Silent One.’ He was almost as strong as
Thorf and was one of the Aesir.t After his father had been killed at 227



Vijaya Vishnu
Ragnarokt by the wolf Fenrirf he avenged his death by tearing the vs off in half. His zodiacal houset was Landvidi. Vijaya. In Ycdic myth an aspect of Parvati.t wife of $iva,t as a goddess of battle. The name means ‘the Victorious.' Vila. An eastern Slavonic! term for Valat or Veela.t It was applied mainly to water sprites and probably originally meant the prophetic priestesses of the rivers and streams. It is well known to many by the song from The Merry Widerx, ‘ Vilia, oh Vilia.’ Vilmeth and Vidolf. The ancestors of all wizards and witches according to the Voluspa.t Vinata. In Yedic myth mother of Garuda,t wife of Kasyapat and sister of the queen of the serpents, which makes her one of the Nagat family.
Vindhyavasini. In Vedic myth one of the terrible aspects of Parvati.t wife of Siva.t The name means ‘the Dweller in the Yindhyas’ and at her temple near Mirzapur it was said that the blood before her image was never allowed to cease from flowing.
Virabhadra. In Yedic myth a monster created by Sivat or Rudrat after his dispute with Daksha,t his father-in-law. This monster is said to have tom out the eyes of Bhagag to have knocked out the teeth of Pushan,t and to have cut off the head of Daksha.
Viracocha. Theheroofan Incat Creation Legend in which, together with Mancoccapact and Pachacamae.t he came from Pacari.t * the Cave of Refuge.’ In an alternative version, Viracocha rose from the depths of Lake Titicaca near Tiahuanacot and created the human race by breathing the breath of life into some of the stone figures there. He was probably a relic of the pre-Inca culture at Tiahuanaco.
Viraj. In Yedic myth the name given to a son of Satarupat and of Brahma,t or possibly a son of Purusha.f
Visha. In Yedic myth a poison produced at the Churning of the Oceant in the Kurmat avatar. It was subsequently seized by the Xagast and became the poison of the cobras. Vishnu. The rise of Vishnu to the position of supreme god of the Yedic pantheon appears to have followed the elevation of Krisna Vasudevat to that position and the subsequent doctrinal enunciation that Krisnat was the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It is certain that this elevation of Vishnu was supported by the Brahmans to offset the popularity of Indra.t who was afterwards gradually superseded. Of the ten incarnations of Vishnu the first five appear to belong to pre-Vedic history and the others may be taken to be religious political moves in his rise to the supreme godhead. They are: i, Matsya/f the fish; 2, Rurma.t the tortoise; 3, Varaha.t the boar; 4, Narasinha.t the man
lion; 5, Vamana,t the dwarf; 6, Parasu-Rama,t Rama with the axe; 7, Rama-Chandrat; S, Krisnat; 9, Buddhat; ro, Kalki.t 228



Visperad Volsung.
Vishnu, the spirit of the sacrifice, is in some ways identical with the
spirit of the Soma.t His first three avatars are different aspects of
the same Deluge legend, the fourth and fifth are recollections of the
conquest of India, and the sixth may concern the putting down of the
revolt on the part of the fighting forces, and the seventh deals with
the attempted conquest of Ceylon. The eighth and^ ninth avatars
arose for purely political reasons, while the tenth, which has not yet occurred, may be considered as prophecy.
Visperad. The second part of the Zend-Avesta,t the bible of the Zoroastrian religion, containing a collection of litanies.
Visvakarma. For details see Vivasvat.t
Viswamifra. In Vedic myth a Rishit who was defeated in a literary contest by Vasishtha.t
Visweswara. In Vedic myth a title meaning ‘Lord of All,’ under which Sivaf was worshipped at Benares.
Vivasvat. In Vedic myth the sun. There exists considerable confusion between Vivasvat, Visvakarma,t and Tvashtri.t It would appear that Visvakarma, the Rishi,t was a priest of the sun who married the daughter of Tvashtri and became the father of Yamaf and of the Asvins.f As an architect, Visvakarma built Amaravatit and Lanka,t cities of the gods, and designed Jagan-nath.t
Vlkodlaks. Slavonic name for the werewolf, from vlho meaning wolf, and daks meaning hair. Popularly supposed to cause eclipses of the sun and moon, thereby showing a kinship with Fenrir,t the Nordic wolf. An alternative spelling is Vookodlaks.
Vogul Creation Legends (Northern Urals). When survivors from the Deluge landed on the earth they found neither trees nor plants, and were threatened with death from starvation. Their culture hero Numitaromt succeeded, however, in growing crops and saving them from death.
Vohu-manah. One of the six Immortal Holy Ones, the attendants of AhuraMazda.t Vohu-manah represented good thought. He was
the genius of the human race.
Volos. A cattle god worshipped by the Serbs, the word
volovi meaning oxen. To the Czechs, however, Vclest was a demon.
An alternative spelling was Volusu.
Volsung Cycle. A series of some twenty Eddie poems covering the
samp ground as the Nibelungenlied,t but much closer to the
original sources. The basis of the story is the theft of the treasure of
the Nibelungen by the Aesirf in order to pay compensation for the
murder of the brother of Fafnir.t The legacy of treason and murder
and the curse of the Nibelungen devolved on Sigurdf (Siegfriedf).
There is considerable overlapping between the Thidrek Saga,t

Voltumna Volva
VoIsung,t Nibelungcn, and to some extent, Beowulf! stories, as will be seen from the comparative table of characters, as given under Nibelungenlied.
Voltumna. Great mother goddess of the Etruscans! at whose shrine state councils were held. Her name is an element in such central Italian place-names as Voltumo.
Volund. The Nordic name for Wayland Smith.t The Volundar Kvidaf in the Poetic Eddat tells the tragic story of his exploits. How he was the son of the giant Badit and was apprenticed first to
Mimirf and later to two dwarfs with whom he quarrelled and slew. He then served with King Nithud, who later had him hamstrung. With the aid of his brother Egilf he built a flying machine and flew home, leaving behind him the heartbroken Bodvild,! the king’s daughter, whom he had seduced. Volund, who is called ‘the Wise Elf,’ is a smith artificer of the type of Goibniuf and, as such, linked noth the dwarfs! who provided the technical background for the Nordics, the Teutons, and the Celts.
Volundar Kvlda. In Nordic myth one of the heroic stories of the Poetic Edda.t Its main characters were Badi,! Bodvild,! Egil,! Mimir,! Nithud,! and Volund.!
Voluspa. The title of the Volva’s! prophecy in the Edda,! in which is told the story of Ragnarok.t The text seems to be a continuation of the interview of Odin! with the sibyl described in the Vegtams-Kvida.t The device of putting a relation of past facts in the mouth of a prophet as a forecasting of future events is very common in myth, and may generally be disregarded. Although the Voluspa is younger than the Lay of Vegtam, the text itself seems to have undergone less modification and it may be taken as the story of the end of the Aesirt which was handed down by survivors to future generations. The shorter version of the Voluspa was found in the Flaty Book,! while a copy of the main text was found in the Book of Hauk,t another fourteenth-century manuscript, besides being repeated in the Prose Edda.
Volusu. In Slavonic myth alternative spelling of Volos,! the Serbian cattle god.
Volva. In Nordic myth the sibyl of the Voluspa,! the Volva’s prophecy, and she also appears to have been the one consulted by Odin! in the story of Vegtam.! It is of interest to note that in spite of their predominantly masculine outlook, the Nordic races continued to venerate the women seers of the previous occupants of the area until well after the arrival of Christianity. The
term Volva may have been a similar one to the Slavonic Vala + Vcela,! and Vila.! The Volva of the Voluspa! was named Gullveig.! 230



Voodoo Vukub-Hunapu
Voodoo Worship. Details of this are given under Bocor,t Mamaloi,t and Papaloi,t and also under Fetish Worshipt in connection with Dahomey.t
Vookodlaks. In Slavonic myth an alternative form of Vlkodlaks.t
Votan. Central American god in the Popul Vuht Quiche Creation Lcgendf who may be assimilated with Tepeyollotl/f the Aztect god, and the Mayan god ‘L.’t In a book in the Quiche language destroyed in 1691 Votan called himself ‘the Snake/ which has been taken by some to indicate a relationship with Quetzalcoatl/ but this
does not seem to be justified. In a disaster myth associated with him he is said to have buried in the subterranean chambers of his temple, Huihuita, the national records of his race. These were destroyed in their customary manner by Spanish priests in 1691.
Vrlhaspati. In Vedic myth the preceptor of the gods, and the son of Angiras,t the Rishi.f
Vritra. The dragon or demon of drought, slain by Indra,t for which deed he acquired the title of Vrtraghna.t In actual fact the whole story is borrowed from the earlier Zend-Avesta,t wherein the god of war, Verethraghna,t slew Verethra.t Even this earlier version is doubtful and may have been invented to account for the title. In India, Vritra was a spider-like being, also known as Ahi,t the son of Danu/ the serpent god. He was one of the Asuras,t and was probably a serpent-worshipping king. In his battle with Indra he appears to have cut off the water supplies of the invading Hindus, a story which accounts for his being the demon of drought. The statement that he was a Brahman may be dismissed. In some respects the story of Vritra resembles that of Sesha.f
Vrtraghna. In Vedic myth a title given to Indra.t
Vue. A term used in Melanesia! to describe the race which built the megalithic structures scattered all over the Pacific Islands. These persons were potent as givers of life, being full of Mana.t
Vukub-Cakix. A giantt of the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the Popul Vuh.t His name meant ‘Seven times the colour of fire’ and he had two sons, known as ‘ Earth Heaper ’ and 1 Earthquake,’ by
his wife Chimalmat.t He was eventually destroyed by Hun-Aput with the aid of Xbalanque.t
Vukubcame. Co-ruler of Xibalbat with Huncame,t as told in the Quichet Creation Legend in the Popul Vuh.t
Vukub-Hunapu. In the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the
Popul Vuht the brother of Hunhun-Aput and with him was murdered
by the rulers of Xibalba,t Huncamet and Vukubcame.t Later his
death was avenged by his nephews.
231



w
Waitlrl. Grandmother of Tawhakit and priestess of a thunder goddess.
Wallum Olum. The Creation Legend of the Lenapet Indians. In it is told how after tire Deluge they dwelt with the manly turtle
beings—presumably some tribe of seafarers—and that Talli/t their
culture hero, led them over the frozen lands to the Snake Land, which they conquered.
Washo Indian Creation Legend. The myth of this California tribe tells of a great seismic upheaval which caused the mountains to catch fire, the flames rising so high that the stars melted and fell to earth. Tin's was followed by a deluge, and some of the men who tried to escape from it by building a high tower were changed into stones.
Watch Merti. In Egyptian myth a name given to Isisf and Nephtyst in the Book of the Dead.t The term may also refer to Mert,t the goddesses of the north and south inundations.

Wennefler. Alternative rendering of Unneffert in Egyptian myth.
Wen Tsch’ang. Chineset Taoist god of literature identified with a constellation near the Great Bear. As he descended to earth and
became incarnate this may be one of the usual instances of a great philosopher being deified after his death.
232



Werewolf
Werewolf. The werewolf of the Teutons and Slavst is a faint
memory of the ritual dances and sacrifices of wolf totem clans such
as the Neuri mentioned by Herodotus. The possibility that mani
festations of frenzy like those of the authentic mental disease
lycanthropy might have been brought on by cold and exposure also
exists. The behef in lycanthropy persisted in mountainous districts of central and eastern Europe until at least 1939
Whakarere-Anu. In Polynesian myth 'Space of Extreme Cold/ one of the Multitude of Space.! Whakatoro-Anu. In Polynesian myth ‘ Cold Space Creeping On, ’ one of the Multitude of Spaced Whero-Ao. In Polynesian myth primal god, ancestor of Tawhaki.t White Magic. This is now taken to mean any ritual practice carried out for the benefit of others, as opposed to black magic,
t
meaning any ritual carried out for personal gain or lust. An important point of difference is that white magic is devoid of any sexual motive. Earlier, however, it meant any practice that was officially approved of, as opposed to those which were disapproved
of—for example, the persecution of witches by people who were
using similar spells and rites for their own purposes. Originally it meant ritual intended to produce or maintain health or fertility.
Wichita Indian Creation Legend. After the Deluge had subsided the culture heroine of this tribe discovered some ears of corn and planted them, thanks to which the ancestors of the tribe survived.
Wieland. The High German form of Volund.t
Wili. In Nordic myth he was the son of Borf and Beslaf and the
brother of Wet and Odin,t with whom he slew Ymir.t As he does not
appear again he may have been merged with one of the members of the Aesirf or just relegated to oblivion with the development of religious thought.
Wimpe. In Algonquianf myth a powerful sorcerer who was
defeated by Glooskap.f The story goes that Wimpe in a contest
grew until he overtopped the pine forest, but Glooskap grew even
taller and managed to kill him.
Wind. A name given to Kolpiaf in the Phoenician Creation
Legend! of Philo Byblos.
Winefred. A variant of Unnefferf in Egyptian myth.
Wintun Indian Creation Legend. The myth of this California
tnbe relates that Katkochilat sent a great fire to bum. up the earth
to show his displeasure at the theft of his magic flute. Later how
ever, there was a great flood and the fire was put out.
Wip. In Egyptian myth a variant of Anubis.f
R 233



Wisaka Wyirrawarre
Wisaka. In the Sac and Fox Indian Creation Legendt he was the ancestor of the tribe. He incurred the displeasure of two powerful
Manitous who tried to bum the land and then to drown it with a deluge. He sought refuge in a high tree on a mountain top, and when the waters were on the point of covering it he was rescued by a canoe.
Woden, Wotan. In West Germanic languages the Nordic culture hero Odint was known as Woden. The fact that the Eddicf stories are much fuller than anything which West Germanic myth has so far produced supports the assumption that Odin was the earlier form, and that their preservation was due to Christianity breaking down the Germanic myths before they were reduced to writing. The High German form is Wotan.t
Wyirrawarre. In Australian myth a name for heaven or the sky in the myth of the Narrinyeri tribe. It was to this that their culture hero, Nurrundere,t ascended.
234



X
Xbalanque. In the Quiche! Creation Legend as told in the Popul
Vuht he and his brother Hun-Apu! avenged the murder by Hun
camet and Vokubcame,! sovereigns of Xibalba, of their father
IIunhun-Aput and their uncle Vukub-Hunapu.t Xelhua. Hero of an Aztec! Creation Legend who escaped the Deluge by going to the top of the mountain of Tlaloc,! the water god. He was a giant! and was credited with the construction of the step pyramid at Cholula. Xibalba. In the Creation Legend of the Quiche! Indians as told in the Popul Vuht Xibalba was an underground world inhabited by Huncamef and Vukubcame3t who challenged Hunhun-Aput and Vukub-Hunaput to a game of ball. However, the invitation was a trap in that they first had to cross a river of blood, and then, on arriving at the palace they were deceived by dummy figures of wood
;
when they were invited to sit, the seat turned out to be a red-hot stone; afterwards they were sacrificed and buried. The head of Hunhun-Aput was suspended from a gourd-tree and a princess, Xquiq,! stopped to look at it, when the head spat into her palm and told her that she would become a mother. Later it was her children Hun-Aput and Xbalanque! who finally defeated the rulers of Xibalba. In actual fact Xibalba does not seem to have been an abode of the dead, but rather a series of underground dwellings where ceremonies were held for the initiation of kings, as is the case with the majority of these stories of the harrowing of Hades by great rulers. At a later stage in history the Mayan! empire was known as the empire of Xibalba. It resembles Chicomoztoct of the Aztecs and TulanZuiva.! Camazotz,! the bat god,! was an important figure in these stories.
Xilonen. Aztec! goddess, the young maize mother; she appears to have originated among the Huichol tribes.
Xipc. One of the old gods of the Aztecs! depicted as a being in a
human skin and known as 'Our Lord the Flayed One.’ He may
be compared with the Mayan God ‘ F.’t
Xisuthros. Tenth pre-diluvial King of Babylon; according to Berosus, he •was the hero of the Deluge legend, and was the son of
Opartes. May also be Uta-Napishtim,! the Babylonian Noah. He
may be equated with El-Khadir,! Hasisatra,! and Ziudsuddu.f For further details see Babylonian Creation Legend.! 235



Xluhtecuhtli. Xquiq
Xiuhfecuhtli. Ancient Aztect fire god and lord of the year. He was also sometimes known as Huehueteotl,t ‘the Old God.’ He was the lordt of the first hour of the day and the first hour of the night.
Xmucane and Xpiyacoc. Mother and father gods linked with Gucumatzt in the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the Popul Vuh.t After making the animals they made the first human beings, who were destroyed in a great natural disaster. They resemble Ometecuhtlif and Omeciuatl,t the Aztec mother and father gods. Their mythological son was Hunhun-Apu.t
Xochipilli. Aztect god of pleasure. The name means ‘Flower Prince.’ He was also known as Macuilxochitl.t He was the lordt of the seventh hour of the day.
Xochiquetzal. Aztect goddess of flowers and of craftsmen, wife of Cinteotl.t The name means ‘ Flower Feather.’ In one instance the name Macuilxochiquetzalli, meaning ‘Five Times Flower Feather,’ is given to Chalchihuitlicue.t Mother of Quetzalcoatlt by Iztac Mixcoatl.t She was considered as being the first woman and as such the companion of Piltzintecuhtli,t the young prince. At some later stage she became the patron goddess of prostitutes.
Xolotl. Early culture hero of the Aztecst who occupied the territory of Tenayuca. At some period he became the mythological twin of Quetzalcoatl.t
Xquiq. In the Quichet Creation Legend as told in the Popul Vuht she was a princess of Xibalbat who, having seen the gourd-tree on which hung the head of Hunhun-Apu,t became the mother of his two children, Hun-Aput and Xbalanque.t Seeking refuge from the rulers of Xibalba she went to Xmucane,t who looked after her until the children were bom.

ritual.
Yacatecutli. ‘The Lord who Guides/ the Aztect god of travelling merchants.
Yaghutli. Pre-Jewish Arabian god, cognate with the XJz and the Jeush of Genesis. Is regarded as a personification of time.
Yahweh. Ancient moon god of the northern Hebrews ; may have
been an old Amorite deity. For a long time the name was interchangeable with Baal.t
Yakshas. In Vedic myth an alternative name for Rakshasas.f
Yama and Yami. In early Vedic myth Yama and Yami were a
hero king and his sister, or wife, rulers of a Valhallat of the Aryans, where the valiant would for ever enjoy the delights of a carnal paradise. Later, however, with the ousting of the early gods by Brahman importations, Yama gradually became grim and harsh,
finishing as the guardian of the hell of the Hindus. Yama was an Aditya.t In Chinese myth he was known as Yen-Wang.t Yama
and Yami were the children of Saranyu.t Yama corresponds to the Zoroastrian Yima.t
Yamilka. A story from the Arabian Nights relating, inter alia how the family of a serpent king were killed by the falling of a star from heaven. It is an early disaster myth which has survived by being incorporated in Arab folklore. There is also a marked similarity to the Gilgamesht story and the story of the Shipwrecked Sailor.t See also Serpent Myths.t
Yamm. Babylonian sea god killed by Baalt with the aid of two clubs fashioned by Rathar-Wa Hasis,t called ‘Driver’ and ‘Expcller.’ With the first he was struck on the body and driven from his throne; with the second he was struck on the head and driven from the seat of his authority. This may have been the ritual for deposing a god.
Yana Indian Creation Legend. Tins Indian tribe of the west coast
of North America have a myth which tells how a man in need of fire
saw a mountain emitting sparks. With four companions he went to
steal some fire from the mountain but on the return journey Coyote,!
who was carrying the fire, dropped it and everything in the world
was burned up.
237



Yang Yemaja
Yang. The Yang and the Yinf are the names given by the Chinescf to the opposing forces in a cosmological system of Dualismf which is said to have been invented by Fu-Hsi in the third millennium b.c. and to have been elaborated in the Yih-Kingt about
1122 b.c. While these dates are uncertain it may be said that by the time of the foundation of Confucianism! or Taoismt these doctrines were so old that their origin had almost been forgotten. The symbol of the Yang, the male element, is an undivided iine ( ) and that of the Yin, the female principle, a broken or divided line ( ). The combinations of these in pairs denote the heavenly bodies or the seasons, while the trigrams denote the elements or the forces of nature. With the degeneration of Taoism into polydemonism the Yang has developed into the ‘Shen,’ the gods of the earth and the air, while the Yin has become the * Kwei, ’ demons to be feared and propitiated. The Japanese equivalents are the Inf and the Yo.f Yangwu. The sun crow of Chinese! myth which may be equated with the Yatagarasu,! the sacred bird of the Japanese sun goddess Ama-Terasu.t
Yarih. Moon god of Ugarit, and lover of Nikkalt; he sent Hirihbi,! King of Sumer, to ask Baal! for her hand, offering 1,000 shekels of silver, even 10,000 shekels of gold, saying: ‘I shall send gems of lapis lazuli, I shall make her fields into vineyards, and the field of her love into orchards.’ This offer was accepted, thus fulfilling the prophecy of El! that Nikkal would be the mother of a wonderful son.
Yasna. The third part of the Zend-Avesta,! the bible of the Zoroastrian religion, containing liturgical works.
Yatagarasu. The eight-hand crow, the sacred bird of AmaTerasu,! the Japanese sun goddess. It may be identified with the Yangwu! of Chinese myth.
Yatis. In Vedic myth a group of holy men who were slain by Indrat and cast to the jackals. This story may indicate the failure of an early attempt by the Brahmans to put down the worship of Indra. The name is that of a present sect of the Jains. In the Zoroastrian! myth they were sorcerers.
Yazatas. In Zoroastrian myth the celestial beings to whom the Yashts in the Zend-Avesta! are addressed. Among the more important are Anahita,! Apo,! Asha,! Atar,! Haurvatat,! Mithra,! Rashnu,! Sraosha,! and Verethaghna.f
Yemaja. River and lake goddess of the Yoruba! people. She was the daughter of the earth goddess Oduduat and the sister and wife
of Aganju.t The child of this marriage was Orunjan,! god of the
midday sun. 238



Yen-Wang Yih-King
Yen-Wang. In Chineset myth the name given to Yama,t the
ruler of the Hindu other world. To the Chinese, however, his power
only extends to the lower spheres of existence, he has no power over
those who by their own striving after purity and goodness pass from
the realm of life and death directly to that of incarnate thought.
Yeti. In the Athapascant Creation Legend it was a great raven
with eyes of fire and wings whose noise was the thunder who de
scended to the flooded world and dragged the earth up to the surface.
He appears to have been the chief of a raven totem clan.
Yggdrasil. The world tree in Nordic myth. It was also the gallows on which Odint had hung for nine days in order to acquire wisdom. The elaboration in the Eddast of the memories of a sacred grove seems somewhat disproportionate and would in all probability be dissipated if there were access to earlier texts. The harts who were said to gnaw its shoots were named Dain,t Davalin,t
Durathror, and Duneyr, all of whom appear to have been dwarfs,
t
possibly the guardians of the grove. The squirrel Ratatosk,t which ran up and down the tree to breed discord between the eagle at the top and the dragon at the foot, may well have been a messenger between the guardians of the grove and its sacred fountain. The assumption that the powers of evil are beneath the roots of Yggdrasil is expressed in the Grimnis-Mal,t where it says, ‘Yggdrasil’s ash, more hardship bears, more serpents lie, under Yggdrasil’s ash, than simpletons think of; Goinn and Moinn, the sons of Grafvitnir, Grabak and Grafjollud, Ofnir and Svafnir.’ As both Goin and Moin are shown in the lists of dwarfs,t it seems probable that the other names mentioned are also of dwarfs. It is an interesting speculation whether Yggdrasil is in any way related to the Hy-Brasil of the Tuatha de Danann.t
Yih-King. The first of the nine authoritative works on Con
fudanism.t The name means ‘Book of Changes.’ The author was
a certain Wen Fang, the founder of the Chou dynasty, who reigned
about 1122 b .c. The work explains all the phenomena of cos
mology, nature, and human existence by diagrams made up of
straight lines arranged horizontally. These were said to have been
invented by Fu Hsi in the third millennium B.c. Of the explanatory
essays, half were written by Wen Fang, and the remainder by his son
Chou. The original signification of these sixty-four diagrams must
have been esoteric and magical and they are associated with the
ongin of the Yangt (the undivided line or male principle) and the
\ int (the divided line or female principle). The appendices include
the ideas of Confucius himself on these subjects. The following
work is the Shu-King.f 6
239



Yfma Yomi
Yim3. In the Zoroastrian Creation Legend.! Yima was warned of the Flood by Ahuramazdat and told to build a Yar, a cave or enclosure, in the Persian mountains in which representatives of all classes of things living should take refuge until the Flood was over. When the disaster had passed Yima sent the bird Karshiptaf to cany news of his safety to any survivors. The story that the
treasure of Yima is still hidden in a cave remains a part of modem Persian tradition. Yima was invited to carry out a religious reform similar to that of Zarathustra,! but refused to do so. Yima corresponds to the Yedic Yama.t
Yin. The female principle of Chinese! Dualism! as opposed to Yang,! the male principle.
Ymir. In Nordic myth a giant! who was father of the Hrimthursar,! the Frost! giants or Jotunn.t He was also known as Orgelmir.t He was killed by Odin! with the aid of his two brothers, Wilit and We,! and his body served to build the world, while his blood caused a deluge which drowned all the Frost giants except Bergelmirt and his wife, who escaped in a ship. In Ragnarok,! however, another version refers to the Frost giants sailing away in the ship Naglfar,! steered by Hrim, who may have been Ymir himself. Other details are given in Nordic Creation Legends,! Audhumla,! and Elivagar.f
Ynglingasaga, Yngllngatal. Names respectively of a prose recension by Snorri Sturluson and a (lost) panegyric by Thjodolf of Kvina in verse on the family called ‘the Children of Yngvi’ who became kings first of Uppsala in Sweden, then of Vestfold in Norway, and finally of all Norway. The mythological interest in the story is (i) the equation of Yngvi with Frey,! son of Njord.f (Compared with Odin,! Frey was not a fashionable ancestor in historical times: only
one English royal family—the East Anglian—traced their descent
from him, the rest from Odin); (2) the possible identity of the Ynglingar with Tacitus, Germania, ii; (3) the highly rationalized
account of Odin’s adventures in ‘ Asia’ = Asgard.f
Yo. In Japanese myth the Chinese Dualistic! principles Yang! and Yin,! male and female respectively, became In! and Yo. Details will be found under Koji-Ki.t
Yokut Indian Creation Legend. In the myth of this south Californian tribe it is told how in the beginning there was an island in the primeval ocean on which lived Eagle and Coyote,! who created men
and women to populate the earth. As there was no food for them they sent the dove to bring seeds for sowing.
Yomi. The other world of Japanese myth. It is presumably that realm which was ruled over by Emma-O.! 240



Yoruba Yum
Yoraba Creation Legend. The myths of this West African tribe centre mainly around the personality of Shangot, their first king, a leader of great ferocity, who lived in a palace of brass, where he kept 10,000 horses. It would appear that all their gods were tribal leaders at some stage preceding their arrival in West Africa and any other religion they may have had involving abstract gods has long since dropped out of use. Further details are given under Aganju,t Amirini,t Eda Male,t Ewuo,t Gwalu,t Ibe Dji,t Magba,t Obatalla,t Odudua,t Ogun,t Oko,t 01okun,t Oiorun/t Orishako,t Oro,t Orunjan,t Ose-Shango,| Oshalla/f Oya,t Shango,t Shankpanna,t and Yemaja,t
Yuga. In Hindu Creation Legendf we are living in the fourth Yuga (or age) of the present Mahayugaf (or epoch). The four Yugas are named Krita,f 4,800 divine years in length; Treta,t 3,600 divine years in length ; Dwapara,t 2,400 divine years in length; and Kali,t 1,200 divine years in length. Each divine year is 360 human years in length. If this latter exaggeration of the Brahmans is omitted, this would give a period of some 12,000 years since the Yedic races came into existence, which accords very well with the origin of the Hindu calendar in 11,500 b.c.
Yuh-Hwang-Shangte. Saviour of the world and lord of creation in Chineset Taoist myth.
Yule. A Nordic festival held on 14th January, when sacrifices were made to the Aesirt; it may have been the day of their annual meeting. The date was put back nine days to correspond to Old Christmas Day by order of Haakon the Good about 956.
Yum Kaax. ‘The Lord of the Harvest,’ a Mayaf agricultural deity who may be God ‘E.’t
241



z
Zabel of the Sea. Phoenician marine beast encountered by Khoserf in his fight against Baal.t This may be a memory of the battle between the sea and land religions for the domination of the coasts of Phoenicia.
Zamna. Alternative name of Itzamna/f the Mayat moon god. He was also known as Kabul.t
Zarathustra. By about six hundred years b.c. the Zoroastrian religion appeared to have reached its nadir, and had it not been for the work of Zarathustra, who reorganized it, it would doubtless have vanished. His writings have come to us in the Zend- Avesta,t which endeavoured to lay down a standard text for the stories forming the basis of the doctrine. He appears to have been a religious leader of the type of Moses, bringing the people back to their faith. In 520 B.c. Darius substituted the new monotheistic religion of Zarathustra for the polytheism then existing. In 485 B.c. an attempt
to suppress the new religion was put down by Xerxes. In 404 B.c. the old religion was incorporated in the new one.
Zarpanit. Babylonian goddess, wife of Marduk,t possibly a form of Aruru.t She was the Succoth Benotht of 2 Kings xvii. 30. She was also known as Ealur.t
Zarya. In Slavonic!- myth a beautiful lake or river priestesst of the healing waters who lived on the island of Bouyant near Alatuir,t the magic stone.
Zcernoboch. An alternative spelling for Czarnobog.t
Zehuti. Alternative spelling for Thotht in Egyptian myth.
Zend-Avesta. The Zend-Avesta, the bible of the Zoroastrian religion, originally consisted of twenty-one books, of which one whole book and a few fragments have come down to us. The work is divided into three parts, the Vendidad/f containing religious myth, laws, and the ‘ gathas ’ ; the Visperad,t a collection of litanies ; and the Yasna,t another liturgical work. Details of the myths are given under Zoroastrian Creation Legend.t The book itself appears to
have been made up some time subsequently to the seventh century b.c. The name Zend-Avesta is given to the Pahlavi translation of the original, on which most modem research is based.
Zerpanitum. Alternative spelling of Zarpanitt in Babylonian myth. 242



Zodiacal
Zervan
Zcrvan Akarana. In the Zoroastrian religion eternal time or
destiny, and the father of Ahura Mazdat (Hormazuf) and Ahriman.t
Later, when Mithraismt had spread to Europe, he became the chief
power. The later Persian Akraf may be related to Akarana.
Zeus Demaros. His inclusion as a child of Ouranost and Geat
in the Phoenician Creation Legendt of Philo Byblos may be due to a mistranslation of the name of some local divinity, such as El.t
Zigarun. In Babylonian myth an early name for Apsu,t meaning ‘the Mother that has begotten Heaven and Earth/
Zio, Ziu, Ziumen, or Ziu-Wari. Old High German or Swabian names for Tiwaz.t While it is possible that Ziu and Zeus may spring from the same Indo-Germanic root word, it seems highly improbable that there was any resemblance between the religious concepts implied by the two names.
Ziudsuddu, or Ziudsuttu. The last of the ten Sumerian kings who reigned before the Flood. Ziudsuddu is named as a survivor in both the Sumerianf and the Akkadiant flood legends, and is recorded as having sacrificed an ox and a sheep to Uttu,t the sun god, whose representative he would appear to have been. He may be equated with Tagtug,t Uta-Napishtim,t Xisuthros.t For further details see Babylonian Creation Legends.t
Zocho. One of the Japanese guardians of the cardinal points. He was the guardian of the west.
Zodiacal Houses. In Nordic myth certain of the Aesirt and the Asynjort had zodiacal houses as tabulated below. In fact, however, these would appear to have been the names of the original residences of the individuals concerned, and their transformation into signs of the zodiac to be of comparatively recent date.

Zoroaster Zoroastrian
Zoroaster. Whether Zoroaster is another rendering of Zarathustra,t or whether he was the actual founder of the religion known under his name, is not clear. It is, however, reasonably certain that the religious doctrines of Zoroaster were definitely in existence for a considerable period prior to 600 B.c., when Zarathustra is said to have put the Zend-Avestaf into writing. Further details are given under Zoroastrian Creation Legends.t
Zoroastrian Creation Legends. The Creation Legends of the Zoroastrians are divided into stages. In the beginning there was Anahita,t the mother goddess, whose influence was so strong that even the Avestat had to recognize it. Then we have the shadowy background of Zervan Akarana,t the father of Ahura Mazda,
t
the power of good, and of Anra Mainyut (or Ahrimant), the leader of the powers of evil. The stories of the battles between Anra Mainyu and Ahura Mazda and their attendant hosts of angels or demons are similar to the Vedic stories of the fights between Indrat and the demons. They obviously refer to the struggles of the Indo-Geimanic races for a foothold in the Middle East. Ahura Mazda stated that the world would last for 12,000 years, a figure which recalls the 12,000 divine years of Brahma,t one thousandth part of a Kalpa.f One may, therefore, conclude that the figures were drawn from a common source, but that the Vedic estimates were carried many stages further. This period was divided into four stages of 3,000 years each, and Ahriman was unable to bring his counter activities to work until the first stage was ended. For the next three stages every good work of Ahura Mazda was matched by some evil one of Ahriman, and the battle will go on until the millennium, when Ahriman is defeated. The creation of living things took place from the limbs and body of the World Cow, and not a giant as in most stories. Finally, a man, Gayomart,t was created, only to be killed by the force of evil. After his death his twin children, Mashiat and Mashiane, were
bom (in some stories, as a shrub or tree), and from them humanity descended. At the time of the Deluge, Yima,t the patriarch, was warned of the disaster, and told to build a Var, or cave of refuge, in the hills, to which he and representatives of all living things would retreat until it was over. Later, however, Yima was defeated in battle by Azidahaka,t the king of a serpent-worshipping people. This disaster legend is of interest as it shows that the cave motif is not confined to the Americas alone. The worship of the sacred fire, which the Indo-Germans brought with them from their northern habitat, was carried to extreme limits under later Zoroastrianism. The guardians of the flame had to see that it was never defiled by the light of day, or by direct contact with
244



Zotzilaha Zuni
human beings. In the same manner the fear of defilement of the
sacred elements of earth, fire, and water led to the custom of dis
posing of the dead by placing the body at the top of a tower, similar
to the towers of silence of the modem Parsees. Here the body was
subjected to a process of weathering, if it escaped being devoured by
carrion eaters. Meanwhile the soul hovered around the body for
three days, and on the fourth ivas escorted by Sraoshaf to the
Chinvat Peretut Bridge over the abyss. Here it was judged by
Mithrat and Rashnu! and, after immediate penance for evil deeds,
proceeded across the bridge. This, however, is broad and pleasant
for the good, but narrow and impassable for the wicked, who fall into the clutches of the demons waiting beneath. This view of the future life represents a compromise between the Egyptian Hall of Judgment and the relative indifference as to good or
evil of the Vedas.t The Zoroastrian conception of Dualism,t with its balanced groups of good and evil powers, persists until to-day in various parts of the Middle East.
Zotzilaha Chimalman. Bat god of the Mayast who is probably the same as Camazotzt mentioned in the Popul Vuht of the Quiche Creation Legend.t The fear of bats manifested in the myths of the Central American races may be linked with the time when they were residing in caves such as those mentioned in the Aztect and Quiche Creation Legends and Nina Stahu,t the Cave of Refuge of the Blackfoot Indians.!
Zu. Assyrian storm god symbolized in the form of a bird. A
tablet (K3454) in the British Museum says that Zu once stole the tablets of Creation from Enlilt and took them to a mountain top. where he hid them. Adadt was chosen as champion of the gods but refused to fight for them. The rest of the tablet is missing, but in the_ legend of Etanat it is said that Shamasht eventually secured their return with the aid of a net in which Zu was ensnared. Zu’s role in this resembles that of Hayagravaf in the Yedic myths. He
may be equated with Garudaf or the Roc.t
Zuhak. In Zoroastrian myth the enemy of Jamshid/f the King of
Persia, whom he slew by cutting him in half.
Zume. Culture hero of the Paraguayan! Indians known as Kaboif
to the Karayas,! Kamut to the Arawaks,! and Tamu! to the Caribs.
He originated from the Place of Sunrise and to some extent resembles
Quetzalcoatl.! He may also be the Kamet of the Bakairif Caribs.
Zuni Indian Creation Legend. The myths of this tribe, which they
share with the other Pueblo Indians, tell how at the time of the
Uduge mankind sought refuge in deep caves. As the waters
receded Awonawilona,! their principal deity, caused the sun to play
245



Zunl Zufii
on the mists spreading over the waters, which dissipated, leaving behind aggregations of green scum which eventually, with the drying up of the flood, became the earth and the sky. After this Poshaiyankaya/f the founder of the tribe, made his way from the caves and found that with the vanishing of the Flood the world was a flat expanse of slippery mud which the sun father dried up, allowing mankind to live. At some time during the Deluge a boy and a girl were sacrificed and thrown into the water. Afterwards two rocks were known as Father and Mother in their memory.

APPENDIX
Abominable Snowman. For centuries there have been legends of strange man-like beasts to be seen in the snow-covered mountains of Tibet. The difficulty of access, the lack of oxygen and, latterly, the political situation, have made exploration of this area extremely difficult, at 20,000 feet and above but few mountain climbers are interested in sidelines, even as fascinating as this one. However, the latest reports from the area show that both British and Russian travellers are inclined to give more credence to the story than hitherto. The footprints of the being have been photographed and several expeditions have sought for traces in vain. The Tibetan name for the snowman is ‘Yeti/ while the females have been called ‘Ladni.’ And that is as far as investigation has reached at the moment. But it seems possible that here will be yet another example where a disbelieved legend turns out to be hard and solid fact. The first reports on the snowmen came from Beton, the surveyor of Alexander the Great’s Expedition to India, who stated :
1 Beyond the other Scythian man-eaters in a certain valley of Mount Imaus [the Himalayas] there is a region called Abarimon where live wild people with their feet turned round behind their legs, they are extraordinarily swift, and roam everywhere with the wild beasts. They are unable to breathe in an unfamiliar atmosphere and could not be taken captive to the neighbouring chiefs or to Alexander.’ The source of this is Pliny the Elder. The odd point is that the Tibetans of today believe that the snowmen have their feet pointing backwards, a fact which enables them to climb mountains speedily.
Asynjor. In Nordic Myth the women members of the hierarchy outnumber the men by two to one, or if the Valkyriest are included, by three to one. They met in Vingolf Hall of the Goddesses. The reason would lie first in the fact that Freyat and Frigga,f whose attendants they are, may be considered as being the same goddess, Frigga being her name with the Aesirt and Freya her name with the Vanir.t In consequence every one of the maids of Freya was duplicated by
’
one of Frigga. In addition the intermarriages with the giantst and
the dwarfs,t who may have represented the Finna and the Teutons,
meant another series of duplicates. Finally the Valkyries,t seem to have been the remnants of a 247



Aurva Brandan
matriarchal clan who were at some period absorbed into the Nordic
culture. The names of thirty-two of the Asynjor are given below, seventeen more are listed under Valkyries,t and three more under Norns,t making a total of fifty-two. Of these, as with the Aesir, it is unlikely that more than thirteen, i.e. Freya or Frigga plus twelve maids, ever functioned at any one time. Beda,t Bil,t Eir,t Fimla,t Fjorgyn,f Freya,t Frigga,t Frimla,t Fulla/f Gefjon,t Gerda,t Gna,t Hlina,t Hlodyn,t Hnossa,t Hom,t Jord,t Lofna, Mardoll,t Nanna,t Rinda, Sagayt Sif,t Siguna,t Sjofna, Skadi,t Snotra, Sol, Syn, Syr,t Vanadis,t Vora.
Aurva. A name given in Hindu myth to a great volcanic erup
tion of the past caused by the Rishi Aurva, who created from his thigh a great consuming fire which would have destroyed the world if Brahmaf had not assigned it to the ocean to a spot known as the ‘ mare’s mouth.’ The fact that this occurred in the sea shows that the story belongs either to the previous occupants of the Indian subcontinent or to the earliest times after the Hindus had arrived there.
Automata. The literature of the Near East and of the Mediterranean Region includes many stories of automata, usually made of brass, which were produced to the order of various potentates. King Solomon, who is reputed to have had a fountain of liquid brass in Andaluz—probably a foundry near the Rio Tinto Mines

which played three times a month, and from which were produced various novelties, including a brass throne with two eagles at the back which spread their wings to keep the sun off anybody sitting on it. Another one had two lions’ heads on the arm-rests which opened their mouths and made a noise when the king pressed on them. In the Arabian Nights there is the story of the City of Brass, in the middle of the desert, where mounted automata cut off the heads of anybody who approached them, and this in spite of the fact that there was nobody left alive in the city. Presumably they were activated by counterweights. These automata came into use when iron was replacing bronze for weapons, thus leaving the brass founders free to exercise their ingenuity on other things.
Brandan or Brendan. An apocryphal Irish voyager who was reputed to have lived in the fifth century. His tour of a whole series of mysterious islands is a hotch-potch of ill-digested information of earlier voyages put together by monks who had, in all probability, never been on a sea voyage of any extent and who did not realize that both climate and geography had to be taken into consideration. His visits enumerate twelve islands: (i) St Kilda; (2) Sheep Island, one of the Faroes; (3) Whale Islandt (as with 248



Churinga uorra
Sindbadt) ; (4) Isle of Parrots; (5) Isle of Monaskry; (6) Isle of Grape
Vines ; (7) Erupting Volcano—possibly Teneriffe ; (8) Isle of Wrecked
Ship; (9) Hermit Island; (10) An Iceberg; (n) A Seal or Walrus
Rookery; (12) Large Island with ripe fruit. (See also the com
parative list at the end of the Appendix.)
Islands Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, and n belong to the climate of the
North Atlantic"; islands Nos. 4, 6, 7, S, and 12 to the South Atlantic
or even the Indian Ocean. The first batch may, possibly, have come within the ken of the Irish sailors and fishermen; the second
batch were most probably taken bodily from the stories brought back by pilgrims and travellers to southern Europe. The historical personage of this name, Saint Brandan of Clonfert,
is said to have been bom at Tralee in Kelly about a.d. 484. He was probably a Benedictine abbot.
Churinga. A name given to sacred tablets of wood or stone containing the souls of members of Australian! tribes. After death these tablets are hidden in trees or clefts until such time as a suitable mother for the reincarnation of the soul appears in the vicinity when the soul leaves the tablet and follows her to her home.
Corra (or O’Corra). The earliest of the legendary Irish voyagers, the others being Brandant and Maeldune.t While the total of islands was less, being but twenty-three, no fewer than sixteen of them also appeared in the other lists, as will be seen from the following: (1) Apple Island; (2) Island of the 4 Castes; (3) Island of
the Mushroom Volcanic Cloud; (4) Hermit Island; (5) Isle with flowing lava; (6) Isle of Erupting Volcano; (7) Isle of the Findrinef Maiden ; (S) Isle of Terraces and Great Birds; (9) Isle of Otters, Elies, and Black Swans; (10) Green Isle with Harp Player; (11) Isle of Man
with Red-hot Spade; (12) Isle of Man with Red Horse; (13) Isle of Black Mourners; (14) the same as No. 6; (15) Iceberg; (16) Isle with Lacustrian Monster; (17) Isle of Monastery; (18) Isle of the Church; (19) Hermit Island; (20) Ant Island (the Formigas Rocks); (21) Isle of Screeching Birds; (22) Isle of the Cornmill; (23) Seal or Walrus
Rookery. Of these Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21,
and 22 occur in Maledune. Nos. 4, 6, 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 occur in
Brandan {see the comparative list at the end of the Appendix). A
large number of these must have been lifted bodily from some
common source. The only items which may be original are No. 7,
the Isle of the Findrine Maiden, which does not seem to be related to anything else; No. 9, the Isle of Otters, etc., which could be any one of the islands between Scandinavia and Iceland; No. 10, the Harp
Player, can only have been in Ireland or Wales, it is hard to see why
it was included ; No. 11, the Isle of the Man with the Red-hot Spade,
seems an attempt to introduce a religious allegory into a story of a
volcanic eruption in the same manner that volcanoes are usually
S 249



Culhwch Gog Magog
described as blacksmith’s forges. No. 12, the Isle of the Man with the Red Horse, might have been one of the Azores, where horses had been introduced by Carthage. No. 16, the Isle of the Lacustrian Monster, may be a distorted picture of a lagoon with a shark in it. Finally, No. 19, the Isle of the Church, is an addition of a later date.
Culhwch and Olwen. One of the few stories in the Arthurian cycle which is purely Celtic without embellishments from the Continent. The story itself is a typical one of a suitor having to undergo attacks and trials before winning his bride. The interesting part is that among the things which have to be produced are many of the treasures! of Britain. The cup of Lhvyr, the cauldron or basket of Gyddneu, the horn of Gwlgad Gododdin (or Bran Galed), the harp of Teirtu, the birds of Rhiannon, the cauldron of Diwrnach, the bottles of Gwyddolwyn the dwarf (a primitive thermos flask). One gains the impression that by the time that the story had been put into its present form the events referred to were so far back in the past that their original significance had been forgotten. However, one thing of importance emerges from it. At one time the
British Celts fought the Irish Celts and defeated them—‘ And when the hosts were utterly routed Arthur and his men went on board ship before their very eyes and with them the cauldron full of the treasures of Ireland.’ From this it emerges that Britain had no treasures until they had captured them from the Irish.
Duzzakh. The purgatory of the Zoroastrians, a place where the Devas might seize the soul of the sinner and plunge it into cleansing flames, which would, eventually, free it from Ahrimant the leader of the evil ones.
Fimbulvetr, the Great Winter of Nordic Mythology, when Hrimthursar,t the Frost Giants, bring with them the ice, while the Fire Giants pour down lava on the land before them. The real point of interest in this is that the tale goes back to the onset of the last great ice age which ended soon after 10000 b . c ., and must date back at least twenty thousand years before then. This does not imply that the Scandinavian races had spent the intervening period in northern Europe but rather that they had always dwelt in the most northerly latitudes and that when the ice age set in they had been obliged to retreat southwards in order to survive. And, later, as the ice glaciers receded, the ancestors of the Norsemen moved northwards and occupied the lands vacated by the ice-fields. The ensuing disaster, Ragnarok,t completes the destruction of the first Nordic culture.
Gog Magog. The giants of this name mentioned by Geoffrey of
Monmouth, and whose effigies were kept in London, have a history which seems to go back to Britain in the Iron Age or even possiblv 250



Gog Magog Gog Magog
chariot and horses, and accompanied by a later period giant com
to the Bronze Age. Magog seems to have been the goddess and Gog or Og her husband or son, of a moon- worshipping, horse-using
race such as the Cimmarians who migrated on horseback.
Og, the giant King of Bashan, may have been the high priest of a Moon God, while from the words of Ezekiel it seems that the
' Hordes of Gog and Magog’ were mounted on horseback. Josephus considered them to be Scythians, a description which included the Cimmarians. Fenius Farsa, the founder of the Milesian race, a grandson of Magog, was described as a Scythian.
However, by the time that the cult had reached Britain, Magog was the great mother goddess associated with a horse cult, memories of which still persist in the ride of Lady Godiva through Coventry,
clothed only in her hair, and in the Lady of Banbury Cross, who had rings on her fingers and bells on her toes. The horse had to be white, although on certain occasions the woman riding it blacked herself all over. The White Horse of Uffington seems to have served as a model for the horse on early British coins, with its beak, disjointed legs, and, in the case of a coin found at Carn Brea, four teats discharging milk, and was the emblem of a fertility cult. The White Horse at Bratton, the earlier one, not the present copy, seems to have been improved to an extent where it lost its original shape. The point of these observations is that the White Horse symbol appeared in Britain before the time of Alexander the Great, and the coining of the first stater with its horse on the reverse, from which the early British are presumed to have copied their coins. Why should they do so when they had a perfectly good horse of their own which was also a well-known religious symbol? Recently a Cambridge archaeologist, Mr T. C. Lethbridge, discovered on Wandlebury Hill, adjoining the Gog Magog Hills, a most remarkable hillside figure of a goggle-eyed goddess complete with plete with raised sword, and a sun god of equal size. Both these seem to represent the gradual displacement of the mother goddess by the father gods, but the popular belief in the old gods must have been too strong for their complete effacement. There arc two other hill figures in Britain which may be contemporary with the Uffington Horse and the Wandlebury Goddess.
These are the Long Man of Wilmington, holding in each hand what appears to be a long staff, about 140 feet in length, but which may represent the doors separating day from night ; and the Ceme Giant, a Hercules type, holding an upraised club. Photographs of both of these give indications of other shadowy figures, now’ almost ob
literated by vegetation, which may fit into the Gog Magog theory.
The dates of these figures have been put as between 4oo°b.c. and
A

least a possibility that the invasion of Britain by the Trojans recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth, with the overthrowing of Gog Magog at Plymouth, might be a memory of the Belgae attacking and overthrowing the worshippers of Magog, their predecessors as emigrants across the Straits of Dover. It is known that there was a hill figure of a giant at Plymouth winch is now overbuilt. The architectural skill involved in laying out these hill figures must have been considerable, as in none of them is there any place within reasonable reach where it is possible to see the whole figure at once. The appreciation of the modem generation of these features of the landscape has only become possible thanks to air photography or the use of long-range lenses. One can only suppose that a master plan was made, and from it the actual figure laid out, possibly by dividing it into numerous small squares. While the worship of Magog, in one form or another, was known throughout western Europe, the cutting of these liillside figures was peculiar to Britain, as also the ceremonial processions of a priestess or representative of the goddess, riding naked on a white horse, while the populace were sternly enjoined to keep within their doors to avoid a breach of religious taboo. The picture of religious life in early Britain is gradually evolving but is still incomplete.
Guanche Theogony. The Guanches of the Canary Islands appear to have been refugees from the mainland who exterminated the original inhabitants. They had an all-encompassing male deity named Abora in Palma, Achaman in Teneriffe, Acoran in Gran Canary, and Eraoranzan in Teneriffe. The Gran Canary name shows marked traces of Muslim influence. There was also a goddess named Monieba who lived in Hierro, and a devil named Guayota whose hell was the volcano of Teneriffe, which was named Echeyde. The Guanches practised mummification, a trait which they had in common with the Egyptians. They also did not know of the wheel, employing sleds for transport.
Hvergelmir. In Nordic Myth twelve rivers flowed from the fountain of Hvertelmir in Niflheimt or Hela.t These were: Fimbul/f Fjorm, Gjoll, Gunnthra, Hrith, Leiptur, Slith, Svaul, Sylgil, Thulr, Vith, and Ylgr. As, with the exception of Fimbul,t these names occur nowhere else in the Eddas, it is presumed that they must represent the oldest geographical memories of the pre ice-age era. The twelve rivers are together known as Elivagar.
Maeldune. A legendary Irish traveller akin to Brand ant and
Corra.t He is stated to have visited no less than thirty-three islands of which it has only been possible to identify a few. The list is as follows: (i) Murderers’ Island; (2) Ant Island (the Formigas Rocks); (3) Isle of Terraces and Great Birds; (5) Isle of Horse with 252



Merlin’s Mirror
Merlin’s Mirror
Clawed Feet; (5) Isle of the Horse Race (probably Corvo); (6) Isle of
High Place with stone House; (7) Apple Island (Avalon?); (8) Isle
of the Wondrous Beast; (9) Isle of Biting Horses (this may be Smd
bad’sf Island); (xo) Isle of the Fiery Swine; (xi) Island of Palace of
Little Cat (one of the Azores); (12) Isle of Black and White Sheep
(one of the Faroes) ; (13) Isle of Flowing Lava, and giant swine and
cattle; (14) Isle of Corn Mill; (15) Isle of Black Mourning Women (? one of the West Indies); (15) Isle of four fences: gold, silver,
brass, and crystal (possibly a misunderstanding of the Hindu caste system); (17) Isle of Glass Bridge (an iceberg); (18) Isle of Shouting
Birds (parrots, also mentioned by Brandan and Corra) ; (19) Hermit Island; (20) Isle of golden sand, white chalk, and a spring of water; (21) Volcano in eruption (possibly Teneriffe); (22) Iceberg; (23)
Undersea Island (a Lagoon in West Indies?); (24) Monkey Island with coconuts; (25) Island with waterfall and salmon; (26) Island with silver column (this recalls the Findrinef of Corra); (27) Island standing on a pedestal (the mushroom volcanic cloud during an eruption, also mentioned by Corra); (28) Island with nunnery of eighteen women; (20) Island of Red Berries; (30) Island of Sheep and an Eagle, with which is combined fountain of youth (possibly one of the Faroes or Shetlands); (31) Isle of Revellers (probably a monkey island, similar to that of Sindbadt; (32) Island with monk and hawk (probably St Kilda). The voyages attributed to Maeldune range from the tropics to the Arctic, from the West Indies to the Canaries, they even include places visited by travellers in the orient. The Azores and places north, and even the West Indies may have been within the ken of the Irish travellers, but it was unlikely that they would venture as far south as the Canaries. There is always the possibility that the mushroom cloud may have been St Pierre, Martinique, in eruption. Nevertheless the descriptions may be taken to be those of actual places visited at one time or another by some sea venturer. In considering these early voyages it must be remembered that the total number of islands which could have been encountered in the Atlantic Ocean by mariners was small. There were 10 in the Azores, including the Formigas; 8 in the Canaries; 6 in the Cap
Verde—assuming that sailors got so far south; 4 in the Faroes; and
4jn the Madeiras. Adding Greenland, Iceland, Rockall, and St. Kilda, the total is 36. As it is unlikely that any traveller visited
them all, the figure should be reduced by half, which brings it well within the lists of the three Irish travellers. It may be taken that
any stories of the Mediterranean or further east are third or fourth
hand. The coastal islands, Hebrides, Shetlands, and the like, are not
included, as to go there was a normal voyage and not an adventure.
See the comprehensive list of islands at the end of the Appendix.
Merlin’s Mirror. A magic mirror, said to have been invented by 253



Nine Og
Merlin,! which gave warning of the advent of an enemy. It may have been some form of camera obscura.
Another version of the talc says that Merlin made two brass images of men which would throw a ball from one to the other to arouse the citizens. This, however, appears to be but one of the automatat so common in the literature of the Near East which has managed to become inserted in Arthurian myth. The mirror resembles that reported by Benjamin of Tudela as standing in the Pharos at Alexandria.
Nine Worlds. In Nordic myth, the universe was divided into nine sections as listed below: 1. Ljosalfaheim, the heaven of the righteous, separated by Vidblainn from 2. Muspellt heim, the home of the flame spirits led by Sutur,t separated by Andlang from 3. Godheim, the dwelling of the Aesir.t 4. Vanaheim, the dwelling of the Vanir.t 5. Mannheim, the abode of mankind. 6. Svartalfheim, the cavern world where dwell the elves. 7. Jotunt heim, the land of the giants. 8. Helheim, the region of death. 9. Niflheim,t the lowest region in which dwelt also Nastrond. It is interesting to note that the Aesir insisted on retaining their social status vis-a-vis the Vanir, even although the two races had fused into one.
Odinic Trinity. The Trinity of Nordic Myth, consisting of the High, the Equally High, and the Third, referred to in the second chapter of the Prose Eddaf; their names were Har, Janfar, and Thridi, in ascending degree of importance.
Og. The giant King of Bashan, from whose name we may have acquired the word ‘ogre’ coined by Charles Perrault to describe man-eating giants. The name is frequently paired as Gog Magog,
t
when Magog was the Moon Goddess and Gog or Og her spouse or son. The ogre killed by Jack of the Beanstalk originally had three heads, in a similar manner to Svantovitt the Slavonic! god. Dr. Margaret Murray has noted that the ogres were not only very tali but big boned, having a broad face with coarse features, high cheek bones, lumpy nose, wide mouth with large teeth, and a coarse, straight, and straggly beard. All of these are characteristic of the Ugrians of south Russia who penetrated to Europe and the Near East from the Black Sea. In addition they were cannibals until Roman times, as were their kindred the Scyths. Og, the King of Bashan, may well
have been a Scythian intruder from the north who assumed the leadership of a tribe. Whether Ogier the Dane who is mentioned in the Charlemagne 254



Rustum
Olwen
Saga belongs to this category is unclear, but be certainly spent most
of his fighting career in combat with the Saracens.
Olwen. In Celtic myth she was the May Queen, the daughter of
the May tree, or the Hawthorn, or the White Thom. Her story is told in the romance of Kilwycht and Olwen, in which Peredurt the
Knight is also encountered. She may be equated with Blodeuwedd .f She was the daughter of Ysbadadden, a King of the Giants, whose life would come to an end on her marriage. In consequence he places every possible obstacle in the way of the prospective bridegroom, but in the end he fails. This is in accordance with the classical tradition.
Orwandil. Name of a giantf who was defeated in battle by Thor,t who threw one of his toes into the sky, where it became a star. In Britain the giant is commemorated by a figure cut in the side of the Gog Magogt hills at Wandlebury, where he is said to have stolen the spring so that winter grew longer and longer until it seemed that the world must die. Eventually he was caught by the gods and cast into the sky, where he became a star.

Rustum. The Persian Hercules whose adventures are described
in the Shah Nameh of Firdusi. The wars described in this work
belong to the period when the Persians were battling against the Indians on the east, the Caucasians on the north, and the Semites on
the west. The period is some time after the arrival of the Indians in India, but not very long, as the Hindu gods have become the
Persian demons and vice versa. Rustum and his mare Rakush, apart from many other adventures, 255

Of these the Whale Island was the subject of three stories of St.
Brandan; the Roc and the Valley of Diamonds seem to have been
known to every writer of oriental antiquity; the Isle of the Cannibals
was also well known; the Cyclops is a story which Homer must have
picked up from the East, it seems to be related to the Gog Magogt
tradition; the burial of the husband with the wife was practised in
several eastern countries and also in Africa; the Old Man of the Sea
may have been a monkey of some kind; the loadstone island may
date back to the time when the compass was first being invented out
of pieces of meteoric iron; the elephants’ graveyard is a hoary story
which is still told in Africa and Asia and which seems to retain in it
certain elements of truth.
The Island of the monkeys was also referred to by Maeldunef as
the Isle of the Revellers; while the Island of Biting Horses visited
by Macldune may be linked with the Isle of the Stallions of King Mihrage, an historical being, visited by Sindbad on his first voyage.
Stone of Destiny. This stone, which forms a part of the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, was brought from Scotland by Edward I after defeating the Scots in 1296. It had been the crowning stone of the Scottish kings and was said at one time to have been the Chair of St. Columba at Iona. However, in actual fact it seems to have been taken by the Scots from Ireland, where it had been known as the Stone of Tara and, earlier still, as the Lia Fal which had been brought from Falias.t It was Walter Scott who said:
‘ Unless the fates are faithless grown, And prophet’s voice be vain, Where’er is found this sacred Stone, The Wanderer’s race shall reign.’
Actually there are several other sacred stones of a similar nature still extant in Britain. There is the London Stone in the City on
which Wat Tyler was proclaimed king; there is the stone at Kingston
upon-Thames on which the Saxons crowned their kings. These stones
seem to be peculiar to the British Isles.
Terrestrial Paradise. The possibility of rediscovering the lost
paradise of mankind inspired explorers for centuries. Perhaps the
earliest reference to it occurs in the Peregeisis of Prescian, itself a
rendering of an earlier work by Dionysius, that is apart from the
iblical v ersion. The earthly paradise was always placed just out
side the region known to man at the time, but the very nature of the
descriptions tend to show that at one time the ancestors of the
Aryan and Semitic races lived under climatic conditions which can
only be described as more favourable than any they have enjoyed
since then. Their enforced exile from there dates back to the
beginning of the last ice age when tropical areas became icy wastes
" hen meadows became and deserts, when the bitter struggle for

existence turned friends into enemies and whole nations into dispossessed refugees wearily making their way towards a climate in which they could survive. The fact of sudden climatic changes is shown by the mammoths in Siberia, who were suddenly wiped out with undigested meals in their stomachs.
Tibetan Lamaism. The religion of Tibet, in theory a branch of Buddhism, was in reality a primitive dcmonolatry including human sacrifice and still retaining memories of ritual cannibalism. The introduction of Mahayana Buddhism in the sixth century seems to have done no more than apply a superficial coating of conformity. An interesting relic of the dualistic system of control is to be seen in the Dalai Lama, who is the religious head, and the Panchen (Tshai) Lama, who is the secular one. Originally this was not the case but the political events of the last twenty years have precipitated the reversal. The Lamas themselves are the higher ranking members of the priesthood down to as far as Abbots. There is a hierarchy of Chutukus or Cardinals who normally assemble once a year at Lhasa for the Feast of Lights. Most of these are presumed to have been reincarnated and, as such, bear the title of ‘ Rimpoche.’ The pre-Buddhist religion was known as Dugpa and its followers are mainly concerned with the practice of magoc, or Tantrism, based to some extent upon Hindu writings. One of these is the Yogachchara Bumi Sastra. The method involves the repetition of phrases and gestures and the use of yantras, magic diagrams, composed of triangles. Healing is also part of the functions of the Dugpa Lamas and involves the use of a method similar to acupuncture. The Prayer Wheel of Lamaism has written on the outside: ‘Oml Mani Padme Hum!’ whilst within it are contained sacred texts, written many times, and packed into a small space. Each time the wheel is turned it equals the repetition of the prayer as many times as it is written. Tibetan myth tells of two demons, Matram and Krodish, who were slain in battle by two Bodhisattvitas, or potential Buddhas. This illustrates the difficulties inherent in superimposing a religion which allows for no specific named personalities upon one where every demon or god had a name and a definite part to play. An interesting aspect of Lamaism is that any form of digging in the earth was considered as being likely to arouse the enmity of the demons of the lower earth. The consequent dislike of outsiders who tend to overlook this has been an important factor in the dislike of Tibetans for all foreigners, recently especially so in respect of the Chinese, who are understood to be mainly interested in exploiting the mineral wealth of the area. The centre of Lamaism is the Potala, the Palace of the Dalai 25S

Turenn, The Children of. In Celtic myth, the sons of Turenn,
named Brian, Ur, and Urcar, slew Kian the son of Canta then

The sons accomplished all the deeds demanded of them, but returned home sorely wounded and all three died.

It may be assumed that the apples were those of Iduna,t the spear that of Piscar, the chariot that of Morgan Mywnoawr, all of which are listed under Treasures.t
Weyland Smith. Perhaps the last of the makers of fain7 or magic swords, in which capacity he is still remembered in Britain. The
legend tells of a master smith who was captured by a ruler during
the course of a war in which he was lamed. He was given his
partial freedom to work at his forge for his captors. For this he
took a frightful vengeance in that he murdered the two younger sons
of the king and made drinking cups from their skulls, and after
wards seduced the princess who had brought him a ring to repair
and escaped by flung through the air, which recalls the classical
story of Daedalus. V eyland himself was the son of Wade, who had

How and by what means the secret penetrated to the short,
thickset, swart* dwellers in the Black Forest, the dwarfs and trolls of Germanic legend, is not certain, possibly along the amber routes which passed near by. What is certain is that the fairy sword makers of northern Europe were mainly centred there where ample supplies of charcoal and surface iron ore were available. The Kalevalat gives a remarkable description of the forging of a magic sword in Runo 9. Here Ilmarinyf the Smith, forges the Sampo and breaks up his melt no less than four times to cast it back into the furnace before being satisfied with the result. In the same way Weyland made two magic swords, one for the Aesir,t Mimung, and one for Beowulft which he used to slay the dragon. The difference between a magic sword and an ordinary one was that the magic sword would actually wound by cutting as opposed to the sheer weight of the blow. The secret lay in the use of high carbon iron, a good charcoal fire, repeated hammerings and heatings, and, finally, the quenching of the weapon in water or other liquid. Gilibur, the sword of Arthur, was drawn first from a black block, presumably of carbon and slag, and subsequently quenched in the waters of a lake. The process was known as false damascening or pattern welding. The swords of the Varangian invaders of Russia were thus made by Scythian smiths. The tradition of the sword makers was that the raw block of metal was left near the forge with a sum of money and that a day or so later the finished sword would be found waiting on the same spot. Except in the case of royalty there seems to have been no personal contact between the smiths and the buyers, possibly because they did not speak the same language. This may simply have been because fighting men felt the work of a smith undignified. The fame of Weyland was shown by King Alfred the Great’s reference to him: ‘ Where are the bones of Weyland now, and who knows where they may be? ’ However it would seem possible that the name 4 Weyland the Smithf’ may have been handed down from father to son, or master to apprentice, for a long period of time until at length the craft of smith became accepted as a normal profession. When Weyland’s Smithy on the Ridgeway was excavated in 1921, two Iron Age currency bars were found, showing that the tradition had been in existence at least since then.
Whale Islands. One of the most interesting of the earliest travel stories is told in the first voyage of Sindbad the Sailor, t in which he
recounts how he and his companions disembarked on a small island and were enjoying a meal when suddenly the island trembled and, plunging into the sea. turned out to be a whale.
An Arab writer, El Kazwene, tells a similar story of a huge water tortoise, while Olaus Magnus described mariners as frequently 260

Brandan. the early Irish traveller, not only saw one of these islands but visited it "several times, on the last occasion celebrated
Mass on it, a statement which puts the whole thing slightly out of context as the voyage referred to must have taken place centuries before the Christian Church had been founded. However, it is interesting to note that the story was known from one end of the Old World to the other and to speculate whether it might not have been based on the second or tortoise avatar of Vishnu,t when on his back was placed a mountain. To the inhabitants of India and the southern seas a tortoise was a usual sight, whilst to the tellers of the Arabian Nights, and to the European writers such as Olaf Magnus, and the tellers of the legendary Irish voyages, a tortoise must have been unknown, for which reason it was replaced by a whale. Naturally there have been instances when sailors climbed on the back of a whale, but that they should assume it to be an island seems out of the question.
