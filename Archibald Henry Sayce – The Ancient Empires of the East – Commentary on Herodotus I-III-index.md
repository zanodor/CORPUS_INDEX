It is more than doubtful whether Eri-Acu, the son of Cudur-Mabug, is to be identified with Rim-Agu, who was conquered by Khammuragas, and recent discoveries show that the conquest of Babylonia by Khammuragas did not follow very closely upon the reign of Naram-Sin. There seem, however, to have been two princes of the name of Khammuragas. „ 438. The cylinder of Nabonidos just mentioned calls Astyages " the king of the tsab manda " or " barbarians." It must have been through a con
fusion between the words Mada or Medes — the term by which the heterogeneous tribes east of Kurdistan were known to the Assyrians

and manda, "a barbarian," that the name of Media came to be applied by Greek and probably Persian writers to the kingdom of Ekbatana. Nabonidos states that the temple of the Moon-god at Harran, which had been destroyed by the "Manda," was restored by himself, with the help of the soldiers he had summoned from Gaza and elsewhere, after the overthrow of Istuvegu or Astyages by Kyros in b.c. 553. He goes on to say : " And Merodach spake with me : ' The barbarians of whom thou hast spoken, themselves, their country, and the kings that are their allies, exist not.' In the third year when it came, he bade Kuras, king of Anzan, his young servant, to march with his army ; he overthrew the wide - spreading barbarians ; he captured Astyages, king of the barbarians, and took his treasures to his own land.

N.B. —In the following pages an attempt has been made to give a correct transliteration of Greek and oriental proper names. But as long as English spelling remains a national disgrace, and no reformed alphabet is in curi'ent use, rigid consistency is unfortunately impossible. Nor can the printer be expected to be always attentive to the clumsy devices by which alone we are able at present to mark the differences between a long and short e or o. As in the case of Greek accents, the most careful corrector for the press will sometimes overlook a misuse of diacritical marks. Any endeavour, however, to approximate to the right reproduction of Greek proper names is better than none at all, and may possibly help to contribute to that most desirable of objects, the reform of EngUsh spelling.






PEEFACE.
The main object of the present work is to show what light has
been thrown upon the earlier books of " the Father of History "
by recent discoveries in Greece and the Levant, and, at the same
time, to emphasize the fact, which Herodotos perceived, that
Greek history and civilisation are but a continuation of the
history and civilisation of the ancient East. The rapid progress
that has been made of late years in the decipherment of the
Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions, the active exploration and
unexpected discoveries that have been made in Egypt, Assyria,
Babylonia, Syria, and Asia Minor, the excavations on the site
of Carchemish, and the recognition of tlie important part once
played by the Hittites, have revolutionised our conception of
early history, and given us a knowledge of the religion and
culture, the languages and inner Ufe, of the old nations of the
Orient which Herodotos and his contemporaries did not and
could not possess. In studies which are growing day by day,
and continually revealing some new fact or correcting some
previous misconception, it is well to take stock of our existing
knowledge every now and then, and see exactly what is the point
to which our researches have brought us. The present volume,
accordingly, deals with the history rather than with the language
of Herodotos, and with that history only in so far as it bears
upon the East. I have not touched upon philology except
where the meaning of a word or name has been cleared up by
the science of language, or where I have myself found a diflBculty
in the grarmnatical construction or exact signification of a passage.



X PREFACE.
Those who would be saved the trouble of reference to a grammar
and dictionary, or who desire to learn what difficulties commen
tators have discovered in simple texts, and what avalanches of
learning they have poured down upon them, must turn to other
editions of Herodotos. It is with Herodotos as the historian,
rather than as the subject for the dissecting-knife of the gram
marian, that I have had to do.
The edition of the first three books of his history now pre
sented to the reader does not profess to enter into competition
with the standard work of Prof. Eawlinson. Its existence is
justified on three grounds. First of all, as I have already said,
it tries to place before the public the results of the researches made
up to the present time in the monumental records of the ancient
civilised world. Dislocated and hidden away as most of the
materials are in numerous learned periodicals, some of which
are scarcely known even by name beyond a very small and
select circle of subscribers, the task of bringing them together is
one which the ordinary classical student would have neither the
leisure nor the desire to attempt, and it therefore becomes the
duty of those who have specially devoted themselves to Oriental
matters to undertake it for him. In the second place, I can
speak at fij^t hand about a good deal of the material worked up
in the present volume, and can claim to have contributed some
portion of it myself to science; while both in the notes and
appendices new facts will be found which have not hitherto
made their way into print elsewhere. Then, thirdly, I have
travelled over a considerable part of the ground on which the
history described by Herodotos was enacted. Indeed, with the
exception of Babylonia and Persia, there is hardly a country or
site mentioned by him in these first three books wliich I have
not visited. And tlie more I have travelled, the more impressed
I have been with the conviction how impossible it is to write
accurately of an event, or discuss with any advantage a historical
or topographical question, without having studied it personally on
the spot. I much doubt if the great antiquity of Egyptian



\
PREFACE. xi
civiKsation can be really brought home to the mind of anyone
who has not actually sailed up the Nile and examined one by one
the groups of monuments he passes on the way, and the successive
stages of culture they imply.
For recent monographs on the relation of monumental dis
covery to Herodotos I would refer to Maspero's interesting
" Fragment d'un Commentaire sur le seconde Livre d'H(5rodote "
in the Annuaire de I'Association pour VEncouragemeTd des IJtttdes
grecqim en France, 1875 (pp. 15-21), 1876 (pp. 185-193),
1877 (pp. 124-137), and 1878 (pp. 124-174); Eugene EevH
lout's " Premier Extrait de la Chronique d^motique de Paris : Le
Roi Amasis et les Mercenaires " in the Beviie igyptologique, II.
and III., 1880 (pp. 49-82); and, above all, Wiedemann's
" Geschichte ^gyptens von Psammetich I. bis auf Alexander den
Grossen," Leipzig, 1880 (more especially pp. 81-100), in which,
for the first time, the methods of scientific criticism are applied
to the records of ancient Egypt. Briill's " Herodot's babylonische
Nachrichten" (1878), though convincingly disproving Oppert's
topographical restoration of Babylon, is little more than a re
statement of the arguments in Eawlinson's Herodotus. For
Persia the student may be referred to Hovelacque's " Observations
sur un Passage (I. 131-141) d'H^rodote concernant certaines
Institutions perses " in the Remce de Idnguistique et de Fhilologie
comparie, VII., 1875 (pp. 243-68), and my own letter on the
"Eise of the Persian Empire" in the Academy, Oct. 16, 1880,
pp. 276-7 ; while for the Hittites and their extension as far as
Lydia my article on " The Monuments of the Hittites," in the
Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archceology, VII. 2, 1881
(pp. 248-308), may be consulted. The natural history of
Herodotos is treated by B. Beneke in the Wissenschaftliche
Monatsbldtter for 1879, Nos. 4-8, 10-12, under the titles of
" Die Saiigethiere in Herodot's Geschichte," " Die botanischen
Bemerkungen," and " Die mineralogischen Bemerkungen."
The net result of Oriental research in its bearing upon
Herodotos ia to show that the greater part of what he professes



xii PREFACE.
to tell us of the history of Egypt, Babylonia, and Persia, is really
a collection of " marchen," or popular stories, current among the
Greek loungers and half-caste dragomen on the skirts of the
Persian empire. For the student of folklore they are invaluable,
as they constitute almost the only record we have of the folklore
of the Mediterranean in the fifth century before our era ; and its
examination and comparative treatment by a Felix liebrecht or
a Ealston would be a work of the highest interest and importance.
After all, it is these old stories that lend as great a charm to the
pages of Herodotos as they do to those of mediaeval travellers
like Maundeville or Marco Polo; and it may be questioned
whether they are not of higher value for the history of the human
mind than the most accurate descriptions of kings and generals,
of wars and treaties and revolutions.^

1 There is no commentary on Herodotos more instructive or interesting than Maspero's admirable Contes igyptiens (Paris 1882), which forms the fourth vohime of Les LitUratures populaires. The author says justly (p. xxxiii.) of Herodotos: "II n'ecrivait pas une histoire d'Egypte. Meme bien instruit, il n'aurait pas donne au livre de son histoire universelle qui traitait de I'Egypte plus de ddveloppements qu'il ne lui en a donn^. Toutes les dynasties aui-aient dil tenir en quelques pages, et 11 ne nous
e<it rien appris que ne nous apprennent aujourd'hui les testes originaux. En revanche, nous y aurions perdu la plupart de ces recits etrangers, et souvent bouffous, qu'il nous a si joliment racontes, sur la foi de ses guides. Pheron ne nous serait pas counu, ni Protee, ni Rhampsinitc. Je crois que 9'aurait ^te grand dommage. Les monuments nous disent, ou nous diront un jour, ce que firent les Kheops, les Ramses, les Thoutm6s du monde reel. H^rodote nous apprend ce qu'on disait d'enz dans les rues de Memphis."

INTRODUCTION.
The Historical Credibility of HSrodotos.
Whether it was that the work of H6rodotos fell upon an age which had imbibed the sceptical teaching of the philosophers and sophists,
and, like the wits at the court of the Kestoration, was ready to laugh
down a writer who made demands upon its credulity, —or whether his residence in the West lost him the literary friends and advocates he^
would otherwise have had in Greece, —or whether, again, his partiality
for Athens aroused the prejudices of the younger generation which gathered like vultures round the carcase of Athenian greatness, and
neither cared nor desired to remember the history of the Persian wars,

certain it is that from the first Herodotos met with hostile criticism
and accusations of historical dishonesty. Hardly had the generation
for whom he ^vrote passed away before Thukydides tacitly accused him of errors which the Attic historian corrected without even naming
the author to whom they were due. While his statements on matters of Greek history were thus called in question by a writer of that very
nationality whose deeds he had done so much to exalt, his history of the
East was categorically declared to be false by Kt^sias, the physician of the Persian king Artaxerxes Mnemon. Bom at Knidos, almost within
sight of Halikarnassos, the birthplace of Herodotos, the position of
Ktesias gave him exceptional opportunities for ascertaining the true
facts of Persian history, and his contemporaries naturally concluded
that a critic who had lived long at the Persian Court, and had there
consulted the parchment archives of Persia, was better informed than
a mere tourist whose travels had never extended so far as the Persian capital, and who was obliged to depend upon ignorant dragomen for the information he retailed. The very fact, however, that Ktesias
considered Herodotos worthy of attack shows that the latter held a high rank in the Greek literary world, whatever opinion there might
be as to the character and credibility of his writings. But the attack



xiv INTRODUCTION.
of KtSsias produced its desired resxilt ; the work of Herodotos fell
more and more into contempt or neglect ; the florid rhetoric of
Ephoros superseded it among the readers of a later day, and, Bauer
notwithstanding, even the antiquarian philologists of Alexandria paid it no special attention. Manetho and Harpokration wrote books
to disprove the statements of Herodotos ; ^ Theopompos, ^ Strabo, * Cicero,* and Lucian,' challenged his veracity; and Josephos^ declares that " all " Greek authors acknowledged him to have " lied in most
of his assertions;" while the Pseudo-Plutarch went yet further, and composed a treatise on the Malignity of Herodotos, in which he sought
to prove that the misstatements of the " father of history " were
intentional distortions of fact It is only wonderful that with all this
Herodotos continued to be read, and perhaps yet more wonderful that his work has escaped the wreck from which but a few excerpts of his
critic KtBsias have been preserved. The last half- century has placed materials at our disposal for
testing the historical veracity of Herodotos which the majority of his
Greek. critics ignored and despised. Year by year exploration in the East and patient research at home have been gradually adding to our
knowledge of the ancient world, and enabling us to reconstruct the
history of oriental civilisation. Assyria and Babylonia, Egypt and
Nubia, Asia Minor and prehistoric Greece itself, have yielded up their monuments to the scrutiny of a generation which has been trained in
the principles of a scientific criticism and desires to discover only the
truth. The contemporaneous records of princes and statesmen who were but names a few years ago now lie before us, and wo know more of the inner and outer life of ancient Babylonia or ancient Egypt than Herodotos could have done even though he had spoken the languages
of these countries and travelled more widely over them than he did. The question of the trustworthiness of Herodotos can now be judged on better grounds than internal evidence or the testimony of
classical writers. We have means for deciding how far the statements of Herodotos in regard to events which happened before his time and
in the foreign countries he visited arc correct. Unfortunately, as we
shall see, the decision is on the whole against our author, and we
shall therefore have to enquire why this is,—whether the mistakes of

INTRODUCTION. xv
Herodotos are due to the circumstances under which he wrote and travelled, or whether, as the Pseudo-Plutarch was persuaded, he was
not only fallible but dishonest.
For the sake of briefness it will be best, first, to see how and with
what object the history was written ; secondly, how far the honesty
of Herodotos can be trusted ; and tliirdly, how far his statements bear
the test of facts.
(1.) Herodotos tells us himself that his object in writing was to
record the famous events of the past, more especially the struggle between the Greek and the barbarian. In other words, he wished to write a history of the Persian War, and of the causes which led up
to it. What else he tells us is episodical, taking the place of the foot
notes and excursuses of a modern book. The history of Lydia is connected with the first beginning of the contest between Europe and Asia as well as with the rise of the Persian empire ; the account of Babylonia necessarily finds a place in a work dealing with a power of which it formed so important an element ; and the long episodes upon Egypt and Skythia are justified by their bearing upon the Persian War, which could not fitly come about until the conquest of Egypt had swept away the last civilised kingdom which stood between Persia and Greece, and the chastisement of the Skythians had made the Persian
frontier safe on the north, and allowed it to prosecute its designs
against Hellas without hindrance or fear. Egypt, too, exercised a most important bearing on the course of the war. Had it not been for its opportune revolt in B.C. 486, the whole strength of Persia would have been flung upon Greece under the direction of the skilful and energetic Dareios, not of the weak and cowardly XerxSs. We are only surprised that Herodotos has introduced no digression upon
Phoenicia into his work, since the Phoenician fleet was a prime factor
in the war, and Phoenician traders were held by him to have been the
first causes of the quarrel between East and West. But the ingenuity of commentators has of course not been satisfied with the simple account Herodotos gives of the object of his work. They have divined other objects as well, and it cannot be denied that
in the choice of his subject, and especially in his treatment of it, Herodotos must have been influenced by motives which appear more or less plainly on the face of his book. Herodotos had travelled and
taken many notes, and, like travellers of our own day, was anxious to
let other people know that he had done so. As it happened, his travels had taken him over the scene of the great war. Then, again,



xvi INTRODUCTION.
he had that common failing of literary men—^jealousy of others who had done what he thought he could himself do better. Hekataeos, as
we shall see, seems to have been the special object of his dislike, and he succeeded only too well in effacing him. But, above all, Herodotos
had a philosophical, or, if the term is preferred, a theological theory,
which was a combination of the old Greek belief in the doom thari
awaits hereditary guilt, and the artistic Greek conception of "the golden mean." Whatever exceeded a just proportion aroused the envy~ and ve/tA€o-is of heaven ; the overweening power and pride of Xerxes
brought upon him the destined disaster, just as it brought destruction upon Kroesos at the moment when he considered himself most secure. Hence it is that the Athenian legislator and gnomic poet has to be
introduced into the Lydian court in spite of chronological difficulties,
in order to preach that doctrine of moderation which was soon to be
verified by facts ; hence it is that the murder of Polykrates or the
expedition of Xerxes has to be preceded by dreams—the shadows of
the events that were to follow.
Kirchhofi"^ has made it plain that Herodotos left his work
unfinished. He could not have intended to break off his history of the Persian War while it was not yet ended without commemorating "the great and wonderful deeds "^ enacted on the Eurymedon and at Salamis in Kypros, or the compact known as the peace of Kimon, which brought to a close the long hostilities between Greece
and Persia. At the same time it is equally clear that the work, as we
have it, is carefully arranged according to a definite plan. And not
only so, but it bears evident marks of having been revised by its
author after its first publication, or at any rate its first composition.
Canon Rawlinson points out that in iv. 30 Tpoa-OijKai must be rendered
" additions " or " supplements," not " digressions," and that the phr
there used, " additions are what my work always from the very fi
affected," implies that the book had already been published. It
otherwise difficult to understand why this protest against a carpin;
criticism should have been made. It is also possible that when Herodotos twice declares (iiL 80, vL 43) that Otanes had really
recommended a republic in spite of the incredulity of " certain
Greeks," he is alluding to objections that had been raised on the first
publication of his work, and not to the criticism passed on the
authority from which he is quoting. The most natural explanation of

INTRODUCTION. xvii
tlie fact that whereas some passages in the book were clearly composed
or revised in Southern Italy, others appear to have been written in
Asia Minor or Attica, is, that it underwent two editions. The passages
\\luth imply a residence in Southern Italy are always, as Professor
luiwlinson says, parenthetical (except, perhaps, vL 127), and can lie
omitted without injury to the sense ;^ while it is difficult to conceive
that the vanity of a Greek could have been satisfied with writing a
1 >ook and not publishing it for years.
Kirchhoff, indeed, has argued ably to prove that the work was brought out piecemeal As the promise of a digression on Assyrian
history in i. 106, 184, is not fulfilled in the third book (ch. 150),
where we should expect it, he concludes that a considerable interval of time elapsed between the composition and publication of the two
passages, and that Herodotos had meanwhile forgotten his promise. As Bachof,^ however, remarks, the Assyrian power had been destroyed
by the Medes, not by the Persians, and therefore the history of it could not well enter into the plan of his work. Moreover, in iv. 1
Herodotos actually refers to one of the very passages in which the " Assyrian History " is mentioned, so that his memory could not have been so short as Kirchhoff imagines. Kirchhoff places the composi
tion of this first part of the work at Athens before B.C. 442, when
Sophokles brought out his Antigone, in which a reminiscence appears
of the history of the wife of IntaphemSs (see iii. 119, note 6), and
when Herodotos received the gift of 10 talents for his work from the Athenian people.^ Bachof reasonably wonders how an author who intended to write the history of the Persian War could have published a fragment which did not reach even as far as the occasion of its beginning. Kirchhoff brings Herodotos to Athens for the second time after the commencement of the Peloponnesian War on

But it must iii. 160 (eiid) ; iv. 99 ; v. 77 (end) ; be remerabere<l that Herodotos under.. 127 (where the list begins with stands Babylonia as well as the kingilom Italy); vii. 114 [end); ix. 73 {end). of Nineveh under the name of Assyria For the others see i. 142, where the so that he must have regarded the Ionian cities are enumerated from south Babylonian empire as merely a contiuutu north, iii. 90, ii. 7.

the strength of a comparison between the funeral oration of Perikles
and the metaphor of the spring put into the mouth of Gelon (vii. 162), and makes him remain there till B.C. 428. During this second visit he supposes bks. v. 77-ix. to have been written.
KirchhofF's dates are accepted by Bauer, ^ who, however, believes that what KirchhofF calls the composition of the second part of the History was really its final redaction. He assumes that Herodotos
had by him a number of individual histories — the Lydian, the
Egyptian, the Skythian, the Libyan, and the Persian — which he had written at various times. These were pieced together into a connected
whole, the first part (to the middle of the 5th book) in Thurii, the second part in Athens. It was the history of the expedition ol' Xerxes which was read to the Athenian people in B.C. 445, soon after the composition of the Egyptian history.^ Bauer's theory no doubt contains an element of fact. Herodotos must have written his history in parts. The existence of such episodes
as that on Egypt goes far to prove it; but the references to the Assyrian history, which was never incorporated into the work, make it almost a certainty.^ The Assyrian history cannot well have been expunged by
Herodotos when he revised (or redacted) his book, and there is no
satisfactory evidence that it formed a separate volume. Nevertheless the Assyrian portion of the history of Ktesias seems to have been composed with the view of confuting the statements on Assyrian matters which had been current under the name of Herodotos. We must, therefore, assume that Herodotos had actually written a work on Assyria similar to that on Egypt, and that while he embodied the whole of his Egyptian volume into his great work, he introduced from his Assyrian volume only that portion which related to • the Babylonian empire, together with a passage or two which bore on the earlier chronology of
Assyria. The whole volume, perhaps, fell after his death into tli< hands of friends, who, without publishing it, let it be known what its
author had said about Assyrian history. It is even possible that Herodotos may have read this and other fragments which went to form
his general history to private circles of friends. Hence the reply of
Ktesias in the form of a counter Assyrian history.

INTRODUCTION. xix
The detached parts, which we thus suppose were woven into a harmonious whole, must themselves have been based in great measure upon notes. Herodotos must have gone about, pencil and measuringtape in hand, examining the relics preserved in temples, noting down the replies he received to his questions from dragomen, Greek priests, and tlie descendants of great men to whom he was introduced, or
measuring the size of the buildings he visited, and the large blocks of
stone which excited his wonder. He appeals to the testimony of his own eyesight and observation ; to the offerings and famous relics
preserved in temples, like the fetters of the Spartans at Tegea, or the monuments to the Greeks who fell at Thermopylae ; to Greek inscrip
tions like the forged Kadmeian ones at Thebes ; to oracles like those
delivered to Kroesos ; to tradition ; to eyewitnesses ^ and personal
intercourse with those who had taken part in the events described, or were related to those who had done so, like Thersander 2 and Arkhias ^
;
to Egyptian priests, or rather half- caste dragomen ; to Persian and
Phoenician writers*; to Greek poets — Arkhilokhos (i. 12), Solon
(v. 113), Sappho (ii. 135), Alkeeos (v. 95), Simonides of Keos (v, 102,
vii. 228), Anakreon (iii. 121), Pindar (iii. 38), Lysistratos (viii. 96), -^khylos (ii. 156), Phrynikhos (vi. 21), Aristeas (iv. 13), Homer and
Hesiod (ii. 117, iv. 32, v. 67, ii. 63), Olen (iv. 35), Musseos and Bakis
(vii. 6, viii. 20, 77, 96, ix. 43)—and to earlier Greek historians and geographers. Among the monuments he saw were many inscribed ones, such as the stem of twisted serpents on which stood the tripod dedicated to Apollo by the Greek victors at Platsea, and which is now in the Hippodrome at Constantinople ; or the tablet of Mandrokles in the temple of Here at Samos;^ or the two columns erected by Dareios and engraved with Greek and Assyrian (i e. Persian) characters.^ The example of the Kadmeian inscriptions at Thebes, however, shows that Herodotos could not distinguish between forgeries and genuine texts even where he had to deal with Greek inscriptions ; and we must be therefore careful in accepting his statements on the strength of supposed epigraphic evidence where we do not exactly know what it was. Besides
monuments of this kind it is probable that he used official registers
preserved in temples, like the dvaypaffMi of Sparta.^ If the latter gave

the length of each king's reign as well as his name, they may explain
the fact that HcroJotos places 900 years between himself and Herakles
(ii. 145) instead of 630, which, according to his own mode of reckoning dates (ii. 142), would be the time required for the twenty-one generations
from Herakles to Leonidas (vii. 204). The oracles probably fonned part
of the oral tradition from which he drew so largely, though, as the oracles
ascribed to Musaeos and Bakis were in writing, it is possible that a written compilation of the oracles of Delphi had been made before his
time (see i 47). We are no doubt indebted to tradition for a good
deal of the folklore which lends to his pages so great a charm. That Herodotos borrowed from Persian and Phoenician writers he expressly states himself ; and as the style as well as the doctrines of the early
Ionic philosophers presuppose an acquaintance with Oriental literature, while Herodotos was born a Persian subject, it might be concluded that both he and his countrymen in Asia Minor were not so ignorant of
Persian—the English of the day—or of Phoenician—the language of
trade,—as is ordinarily supposed. It is quite clear, too, that the account
of the Persian satrapies given in the third book is taken from an
official list. But there is nothing else to show that Herodotos was acquainted with any other language than his own, and the mistakes he makes in his translations of Persian words prove that he could not have understood the Persian language. The same evidence is also borne by Ktesias.^ That persons must have been found in Asia Minor able to
speak both Greek and Persian is of course evident—in no other way could the Persian government of the Greek states there have been carried
on ; but they were probably of no high station in life—mere clerks,
in fact, who made a livelihood, like the dragomen in Egypt, out of
their linguistic acquirements. To learn the language of their conquerors
was unpatriotic, and if the trouble were undergone for the sake of gain "banausic." Possibly Semitic settlers were found to perform the
same office of interpreters between the Greeks and their masters that was undertaken by the Jews in Spain for the Arab students of Greek
literature. In any case there must have been Greek translations of
Persian and Phoenician books, as well as of official documents, from which Herodotos derived his statements ; and the fact that they were
translations may explain why he always speaks of his Oriental
authorities in the pluralv The Hellenic poets, on the other hand,

formed part of the Greek's education, and were the texts upon which the teaching of ypafifjuTa was based. Herodotos had no doubt committed a good deal of their compositions to heart, and an apt quotation
was not likely to be less esteemed in the ancient world than in the modern. Hence it is that while Hekataeos is the only Greek prose-writer
quoted by name—and that only for the sake of disparagement

Herodotos makes a show of his acquaintance with the poets of his nation. A good knowledge of standard poetry was as much the mark
of a cultivated gentleman as it was in the English society of the last
century. It is therefore somewhat strange that Sophokles, the
fashionable tragedian of the day, should not once be named, more
especiall}' as there are evidences of conscious allusions to Herodotos on
the part of the poet, who is even said to have written a poem in his
honour.^ But it is precisely the fact that Sophokles was the fashionable poet of the day which explains the silence of Herodotos. His tragedies had not formed part of the school education of Herodotos
;
he had learned no passages from them, and was consequently unable to quote them. Nor did a knowledge of a poet about whom every one was talking bring with it the same reputation of learning as a know
ledge of prehistoric worthies like Musseos and Bakis. The relation of Herodotos towards his predecessors in prose
literature was a very difiFerent one. They were his rivals whom he wished to supplant. There was no Mat to be gained by showing himself familiar with their names. His chief aim was to use their materials without letting the fact be known. He tries to impress upon
the reader his own superiority to the older prose-writers ; he boasts of
accepting only what he has heard from eyewitnesses (iii. 115, iv. 16), and names Hekatajos only when he thinks he can confute him or make
him appear ridiculous. And yet it is certain that he is largely indebted to Hekata^os for his information, and that in Egyptian matters more
particularly he has drawn without scruple on the work of the writer

he desired to supersede.^ Herodotos wrote for a young and growing
society, not a decrepit and decaying one ; and just as the surest mode
of securing the circulation of a book in ancient Eg3rpt, or in the earlier
centuries of our own era, was to ascribe it to an older author, so the passport to fame among the Greek reading public in the age of Herodotos was the affectation of novelty and contemptuous criticism of older writers. The treatment Hekataeos has suffered at the hands of
Herodotos—and which Herodotos himself was soon to suffer by a just
retribution—prepares us to expect a similar treatment in the case of
other authors whose works have been laid under contribution while their names have been suppressed. This expectation is verified by
passages like ii. 15, 17, iv. 36, 42, where other writers on the sami'
subject, supposed to be well known to his audience, are sneered at ; or by the reference in vi. 55 to the genealogy-makers, who did not come into competition with Herodotos, and are therefore compassionately
allowed to be still read. Among the writers who had preceded Herodotos were Akusilaos of Argos, Eud^mos of Paros, Eugaedn or Euge6n of Samos, Hekatjeos and Dionysios of Milfitos, Khar6n of Lampsakos, Xanthos of Sardes. Deraokles of Phygela, Bi6n and Deiokhos of Prokonnesos, Amelesagomor Melesagoras of Khalked6n, PherekydSs of Leros, and Skylax of Karyanda. ^ Hekatseos we know he used ; even in the ancient world it was notorious that he had " stolen " from that author the descrip
tions of the phoenix, the hippopotamus, and the crocodile.* The " Persian History" of Dionysios, which extended from the reign of Kyros to that of Xerxes, may have suggested to Herodotos the original idea of his own,* while Eug3e6n was probably the source from which he

<lerived his account of Polykrates. The digression on .^op (ii. 134), which is dragged into the narrative much out of its place, seems to bo
directed against Eugseon, who had made the fabulist a Thrakian. Ivharon not only traversed the same ground as Herodotos, but also in
troduced into his history the same pieces of folklore, as, for example, the dream of Astyages^ which Herodotos must either have borrowed from him or taken from a common source. His special work on Lampsakos, however, does not seem to have been kno>vn to the Halikamassian historian, who would otherwise have seen the point of the threat
of Kroesos to cut down Lampsakos "like a fir" (ttiVvs); Pityusa, according to Kharon, having been the original name of his native
city. 2 On the other hand, Kharon's list of the Spartan magistrates
seems almost certainly alluded to in vi. 55, where he is included among other genealogers. The notes of Skylax, again, subsequently worked up with other materials into a Periplus, must have lain at the
disposal of Herodotos, who mentions the explorer by name as well as his voyage (iv. 44), and from them he no doubt derived much of his information about the far East. ^ Whether he laid Xanthos, the Lydian historian, under contribution is more doubtful. His Lydian
history presupposes the use of documents which gave the succession and dates of the Lydian kings and dynasties ; but it must be noted that it practically begins with the period when the kingdom of Sardes was first brought into close contact with the Greeks, and deals mostly with the wars between the Mermnadse and the lonians. On the other hand, the account of the colonisation of Etruria given by Herodotos seems an intentional contradiction of the narrative of Xanthos,* and
Ephoros expressly asserts that the latter writer "gave Herodotos the
starting-point" of his history.^ We must not forget that although there were no publishei-s or printing-presses in the age of Herodotos,
public libraries were not altogether unknown ;^ Perikles at Athens was

surrounded by literary men, and books were at any rate cheaper than

Such, then, were the sources from wliich Herodotos drew his materials, which must have taken their final shape not later than
B.C. 426, the latest possible date for the desertion of Zopyros to the Athenian side (iii. 160). No event subsequent to this is mentioned, since vi. 68 does not imply tlie death of Artaxerxes, and the last
occurrence alluded to, the date of which is certain, is the betrayal of the Spartan and Korinthian ambassadors to the Atlienians (vii. 133137) in the autumn of B.C. 430.^ Kirchhoff holds that the death of Herodotos took place two years after this at Athens, to which he returned shortly after the Delian earthquake at the beginning of ^le Peloponnesian War, 2 and where he saw the Propylaea (v. 77), which were not finished till B.C. 431. Profes.sor Mahaffy remarks that the
little said by Herodotos about the affairs of Magna Graecia, which had been treated by Hippys of Rhegium and Antiokhos of SjTacuse, is " a strong argument against the composition of his Avork at Thurii in
his later years ;"^ but it must be remembered that the history of the
West, scarcely affected as it was by the great war, did not come within the scope of his work.
(2.) Classical scholars have long since determined to reverse the
popular verdict of antiquity which found expression in the treatise of the Pseudo- Plutarch, and to acquit Herodotos of the charge of conscious dishonesty. Mr. Blakesley, indeed, has brought powerful arguments to show that Thukydides and others considered Herodotos
one of the Aoyorrotoi, whose aim was not to instruct but to please,
and has tried both to substantiate their judgment and to prove that Herodotos was in no way a more trustworthy writer than Marco Polo or even De Foe. Professor Mahaffy, top, while agreeing with the current opinion, nevertheless ventures to suggest that the attack made by the Pseudo - Plutarch has "perhaps not been sufficiently
considered;"* but it has been reserved for an Egyptologist, Dr. Wiedemann, to make it plain that the charge brought against Herodotos was not undeserved, and that the " blame " (/iw/xos) which,

according to his epitaph, caused him to fly from Halikamassos had l^en justly provoked.
The speeches put into the mouths of many of his cliaracters bear
the impress of his own ideas and liave always been recognised as his own compositions. But it is usually assumed that they rest on a basis of fact, and are merely what Herodotos supposed might have been said on the occasion of a real event. Our confidence in this assumption
is, however, shaken when we find, firstly, that they are generally intended to convey a moral lesson, and, secondly, that where we can
test the event believed to underlie them it turns out to be imaginary.
Thus the discussion of the seven conspirators after the murder of the
Magian cannot be reconciled with the actual facts, and chronological
considerations make it very doubtful, to say the least, whether Solon could ever have visited the court of Kroesos. There are many other passages in which Herodotos has introduced a legend or preferred one
version of a tale, not because he heard it from an eyewitness, as, when
he is trying to disparage his predecessors, he ostentatiously asserts was
his invariable rule,^— not, indeed, upon any critical grounds whatso
ever,—but simply because it agreed with his philosophical creed, or struck his admiration of " smartness," or, finally, because it threw a
doubt on the statements of earlier historians. Out of the various
stories told of the birth and rise of Kyros he selects one which is a
pure myth, and the folklore he. has substituted for Egyptian history, or the legends he tells of the way in which the precious gums of Arabia were collected, warn us against accepting a statement which may be true merely because it is in Herodotos. The tale^ of the phoenix which he plagiarised from Hekatseos is a convincing proof
how little he really cared for first-hand evidence, and how ready he
was to insert any legend which pleased his fancy, and to make
himself responable for its truth.
But the conclusions to be drawn from his descriptions of the crocodile and hippopotamus are yet more damaging to his veracity. Not only did ke take them from Hekatajos without acknowledgment, but he repeats all the errors of his text while endeavouring all the
time to leave the impression on the reader's mind that they are the
result of his own observation. This teaches us to be careful about accepting his testimony in other cases where he seems to claim the
redit due to personal experience, but where we cannot test his state

ments. It prepares us also for an affectation of knowledge which leads him sometimes to make erroneous assertions, sometimes to conceal real ignorance, and is in every case misleading. Thus, to judge from the way in which he writes, Herodotos must have been a marvellous linguist, able to converse freely with Egyptians, Phoenicians (ii. 44), Arabians (iii. 108), Carthaginians (iv. 43), Babylonian
(i. 181-183), Skythians (iv. 5, 24), Taurians (iv. 103), Kolkhians (ii. 104), Thrakians (v. 10), Karians and Kaunians (i. 171-172), and Persians. Yet when he ventures to explain words belonging to any of these languages he generally makes mistakes and simply displays Ins total ignorance of them (as, for example, when giving an inter
pretation of the names of the Persian kings, vi. 98). In il 104, 105, he assumes an acquaintance with the languages of both Egypt and
Kolkhis, and pronounces them to be alike—a verdict which may be put by the side of his other assertion that Egyptian resembled the chirping
of birds (ii. 57). When, however, we find him further calling the Kolkhians woolly-haired and black-skinned, we begin to doubt whether
he could have visited the country at all, much less have made enquiries
of its inhabitants. The doubt is confirmed if we look more closely
into what we find elsewhere in his narrative. From time to time, when speaking of Egypt, he alludes to a god whose name he will not
mention, he says, for religious reasons.^ The god in question is
shown by the context to be Osiris ; and, as Wiedemann remarks, the
only religious scruple the Greek traveller could have had against pro
nouncing the name of a deity which was constantly in every native's mouth, and was perpetually meeting his eyes on numberless monu
ments, and in fact is mentioned by Herodotos himself elsewhere, must have been ignorance. Herodotos or his authorities had not caught the name when taking notes, but instead of confessing the fact
" the father of history " deliberately deceives liis readers. It is no
wonder, therefore, if after this we can further convict him of what, in these days, would be termed literary dishonesty of a most serious
character, inasmuch as it aflFects the credit and veracity of a consider
able portion of his work. Herodotos wishes his readers to believe
that he had visited Upper as well as Lower Egypt. It is true that,

in so many words, but he does his best to convey the impression, and
in one place (ii. 142-143) resorts to a kind of verbal legerdemain in order to effect his object. Here he gives the reader to understand that the 345 statues Hekataeos had seen at Thebes two generations
previously were the same as the 341 statues Herodotos saw— as the
preceding chapters show—at Memphis, and at the same time contrasts liis own superior modesty and wisdom with the ignorant vanity of the
older historian whom he now names for the first time.^ There is clear evidence that Herodotos never ascended the Nile higher than the Fayfim. Had he done so he would not have lavished such praise upon the labyrinth and been silent over the wonderful buildings of
Thebes, nor would he have gravely repeated the story—due, probably,
to the misunderstanding of his dragoman—which made the Nile rise at " the city " of Elephantine. ^ But Hekatseos had visited Thebes, and if he were to be supplanted it was needful that Herodotos too should
have been at least equally far. This is the only excuse for the
deliberate falsehood in ii. 29, where he declares that he " came as an eyewitness as far as the city of Elephantine." In calling Elephantine
a city, however, instead of an island, he betrays the real facts of the case, and it may be hoped that the Angelican MS. (prima manu) [b],
which omits the clause, represents the original text of Herodotos (see
il 29, note 7).
So flagrant an example of dishonesty excites our distrust of the
extended travels to which Herodotos implicitly lays claim. The
suspicions aroused by his extraordinarily inappropriate description of the Kolkhians are confirmed, and we are inclined to doubt whether what Herodotos has to tell us of the eastern part of the Black Sea
was not derived from others—from those " eyewitnesses " of whom he was 80 proud. At any rate, as Mr. Bunbury remarks,^ there is no evidence that Herodotos ever travelled as far as Susa, the expression
used of the Eretrians at Arderikka—that they remained there up to
his own time (vi. 119)—being the very same as that used of the Barkseans in Baktria (iv. 204), a country which few would be disposed to maintain was visited by him. Moreover, the diflSculties connected
with the description of the royal road from Sardes to Susa * can only be explained on the supposition that it was borrowed from another

work. Not only are the numbers given for each day's journey inconsistent with the final summing up, "but if the Gyndes be taken as the frontier between Armenia and Matiene, the enormous extension thus given to Armenia is altogether at variance with the distance assigned
to this part of the route ; the march through Assyria, from the river
Gyndes to the neighbourhood of Mosul — the lowest point at which
the road could well have crossed the Tigris— being jvlone fully equal to the 66 parasangs allowed to Armenia, thus leaving the whole intermediate space, from the Euphrates to the Tigris, unaccounted for;" while the extension given to Armenia "is equally at variance
with the extent assigned to it in the description of the Satrapies."^ It may be added that no one who had actually crossed the Gyndes would have thought that its waters had been dissipated into 360 rivulets by Kyros, as Herodotos does in i. 189-190.2 As Herodotos does not describe any other road to the East, and it
is pretty evident that he never travelled along this particular one, we
must conclude that he never visited Assyria and Babylonia. This will explain his comparative silence about such important and interesting countries as Syria and Assyria Proper. Yet, just as much as in the case of Upper Egypt, he has endeavoured to produce the impression that he had visited Babylonia and conversed there with Khalde.in
priests, and his endeavour has been so successful as to deceive the majority of his commentators. One passage, in fact, L 183, where he
wishes it to be inferred that he did not see the golden statue of Bel at Babylon because it had been removed by Xerxes, is as flagrant a piece of prevarication as his statement about the 341 images he saw in
Egypt. It is true he does not positively assert that he was in Babylonia,
but it is the natural inference from his words. The prevarication
would have more easily escaped detection if he had said he did not see
the temple itself, as well as the image it contained, since it had been
destroyed by Xerxes (Arrian, vii. 1 7) at the same time that the Persian king had carried away the statue. But unluckily Herodotos did not
know this, and accordingly describes the temple at length, leaving it to be understood that he had carefidly examined it himself It is doubtful, however, whether he intended to mean by the words ws lAcyov ol XakSaioi in the same chapter, " as they told me when I was
there," since they vwjht signify " as they used to say;" and we can
afford him the benefit of the doubt But when he says in chapter 193

that he will not mention the size of the millet and sesamfi plants, " knowing well that those who had not gone so far as Babylonia
"
^\ould not believe what had been stated of the luxuriance of the vegetation there, he is again trying to convey a false impression, even though his words may be quoted from another author. We have not to read far to see that Herodotos could not himself have been in
Khaldea. Apart from the historical misstatements — two of which, relating to the sieges undergone by Babylon, could hardly have been
made by a visitor to the spot ^—a writer who speaks of " immense stones " in Babylonia,^ who does not know the real site of Opis,^ and describes imaginary cuttings near Arderikka, a place probably quite as
imaginary,* who asserts that the walls of Babylon had been destroyed
by Dareios,^ and fancies that rain falls but seldom in the country,^
stands self-convicted of never having visited the district he undertakes
to describe. No one, indeed, who had done so would have called Babylonia Assyria,'' or have confused the Babylonian with the Assyrian empii-e. The name of Assyria was never used by the Babylonians of
the age of Nebuchadrezzar and his successors, much less by those of the Persian period. It must have been derived by Herodotos from his antiquarian researches among older Greek writers when working up the materials for his Assyrian history, and have come down from a time when Gyges was a vassal of Assur-baui-pal or Sardanapalos, and the Assyrian power was influencing the fortunes of Lydia and Ionia.* Ktesias had good reason for accusing Herodotos of errors in his Assyrian history; and if we may judge from the specimens of it incorporated in his work, its disappearance is no great loss.
(3) The conclusion we are driven to, accordingly, is that Mr.
Blakesley is right in considering Herodotos a mere AoyoTroios. Ho pilfered freely and without acknowledgment ; he assumed a knowledge he did not possess ; he professed to derive information from personal
experience and eyewitnesses which really came from the very sources

) he seeks to disparage and supersede ; he lays claim to extensive travels
' which are as inytliical as those of the early philosophers ; and he in
troduces narratives or selects particular versions of a story, not because
they were supported by good authority, but because they suited the
turn of his mind, and fitted into the general tenor of his work.
[ With such evidences, then, of unveracity staring us in the face, it
becomes a question how far we can trust his statements and accept his authority in historical or topographical matters. In order to answer it we must first distinguish between the countries he can be proved to have visited, and those which there is good evidence to show that he
1 did not. After all, he need not have been ashamed of the extent of his travels j if they could not rival those of Hekatajos or Skylax, they had certainly extended over the greater part of the civilised portion of the Mediterranean. Like a true Greek, Herodotos kept as near the sea as possible ; we have no proof that he ever penetrated far inland.
He had visited Greece and its sacred shrines, making a pilgrimage as far as Dddona, and probably coasting along the shores of Thrake from Athos to Byzantion. He had been as far south in Egypt as Lake
Moeris, had sailed along the shores of Palestine and Syria, touching at
Tyre, Beyriit,^ Kypros,- and Rhodes,^ like a modern tourist returning from Egypt by an Austrian Lloyd steamer, had apparently stayed at Kyren6, and had made the acquaintance of the chief islands of the
JEgesiU, including of course Delos. He had resided in Magna Grsecia, and probably also, as the legend of his life asserts, in Samos.* The
western coast of Asia Minor was naturally well known to him. He was born at Halikarnassos, and was acquainted witii Lydia and its capital Sardes, with Ephesos and the Kaikos, and probably with the
Troad as well.''
Except in Egypt, and at Tyre and Sardes, he was not necessarily brought into contact with any but a Greek- speaking population ; in
Egypt and Syria, as well as at Sardes, he had to depend upon dragor men ; but his voyages were doubtless performed in Greek boats.
Egypt, Syria, and Lydia apart, therefore, he had no difficulty in picking up information, and no need of consulting any but Greek
authorities. As regards what may be termed the Greek portion of his

history, accordingly, we may allow his statements the credibility that
is usually claimed for them. His account of the nations on the western coast of Asia Minor
stands on a somewhat different footing. The history of Lydia, if
drawn from first-hand sources, must have rested on the authority of persons who spoke a different language from his own, but for reasons
already alleged (p. xxiii) it is probable that this was not the case, and that he made use of Greek documents or traditions. Of Karia he was able to speak from personal experience ; the relatives and friends of his boyhood lived on Karian soil, and what he tells us of Karian manners and traditions, as well as of the Kaunians and their language, may be accepted without questioning. With Samos he shows a special acquaintimce, and he may well have laid the history of Eugseon under
contribution (see p. xxiii). For the coasts of the -^gean as well as for Greece we may consider Herodotos both to be a witness at first hand, and to have supplemented his own experience by the use of the best
authorities he could find. No doubt he did not exercise much criticism
in dealing with the latter, and as he never gives references to the books he- employed, we cannot distinguish between matter which comes from really trustworthy sources and that which does not. No doubt, too, his own observation was not very exact, and he may very possibly have made mistakes in repeating what he had read or heard. But these are drawbacks to which most ancient authors are subject. It is very different, however, when we come to the East. In Egypt he was a mere tourist, unable to speak the language of the country, and furnished with no introductions to cultivated natives. He was
left to the mercies of half-caste dragomen ^ and the inferior servants of
the temples, who were allowed to gain a little bakshish by showing
them to inquisitive Greeks. Herodotos dignifies them with the name of priests ; but the Egyptian priest did not speak the language of the Greek barbarian. Every traveller will know what a strange idea he
would carry away with him of the history and character of the monuments he visits, and the manners and customs of the country, if he had to depend on what he was told by his guides and cicer&ni. How little Herodotos saw of the higher society of Egypt may be gathered

from his assertions that the Egyptians used only bronze cups,^ and did not eat wheaten bread.^ Of course what he saw himself he may be supposed to describe with fair accuracy ; but we can seldom tell
what he really did see himself, or wliat he is not merely making the reader believe he had seen. Moreover, his attitude towards
Hekatieos on a question like the causes of the rise of the Nile raises
the suspicion that he may have treated his predecessors as Ktesias treated him, admitting a legend on any or no evidence simply because
it contradicted what they had written. It is only necessary to read through the notes on the second book to see that the majority of the statements made by Herodotos about Egyptian matters are now known
to be false, and that there are many in which we can trace a deliberate
intention to deceive. It is just the same with his notices of Babylonia, or Assyria as he erroneously terms it; and his knowledge even of
Persian history, manners, religion, and language is equally defective. Here, however, his shortcomings are redeemed by the use of official
documents, like the list of the satrapies, or the description of the royal
road to Susa. How these came into his hands it is useless to enquire. His birth at Halikarnassos may have enabled him to obtain them from a government clerk who had translated them into Greek, or they may hjvve been contained in one of the books which he consulted for his history. He certainly did not understand Persian himself, and there
is no sign of his being acquainted with Persians of social position, unless it were Zopyros the son of Megabyzos.' As regards Persian history, therefore, we cannot expect him to have been so well infonned
as Ktesias, who had access to the royal archives — the Siffydepal jiaa-t.

and Egypt, the affectation of a knowledge he did not possess, and con
cealment of the sources from which he derived his information, still further diminish his authority. Consequently it is only where his statements are confirmed by the native monuments whicii modern research has brought to light that we can rely upon them ; in otlur cases, where they are not proved to be false by monumentiU or internal evidence, we must adopt towards them the attitude of mind of the ancient sceptics.

Hi-rodotos l)as thus been brought to an end by the discoveries of
recent years. It only remains to say a few words on the character
"assigned by the same discoveries to his critic Ktesias, since on this will depend our view of the questions upon which, when Herodotos and Ktesias are at variance, the monuments as yet throw no light.
In the first place, then, it is quite clear that Kt6sias really based his
history on Persian materials. The greater part of his Assyrian history
consists of Assyro-Babylonian myths rationalised and transformed in
the manner peculiar to the Persians, of which Herodotos gives us an illustration in the legend of 16.^ Semiramis is the Assyrian Aphrodite, Ninos and Ninyas are Nineveh and its inhabitants ; and the names given to many of their successors, such as Arios, Armamithr^s, and
Mithraos, are Persian titles or divine names. It is significant that
Baleus, the Assyrian bilu, "lord," is said to have been also called Xerxes, the Persian Khshayarshd, from khshaya, which existed by the side of khsMyathiya, "king."^ In the second place, when we come to Persian history, we find several statements made by Ktesias which
disagree with those of other classical authorities, but have been un
expectedly verified by recent discoveries. Thus he makes the reign of
Dareios last only thirty-one (or tiiirty-two) years, the real length of it ac
cording to the Babylonian contract-tablets, which place his accession in
B.C. 517. On the other hand, there are other assertions which are shown
to be untrue, as, for example, that the Magian usurpation did not take place until after the death of Kambyses. On this point Herodotos was
in the right. But it must be remembered that the loss of the original works of Ktesias makes it difficult to determine how far he has
reported his authorities correctl}^ or yielded to the desire of con
tradicting Herodotos at the expense of truth. At any rate it is
certain that he was justified in claiming for his history the authority
of Persian documents, and that many of the charges of falsehood brought against him must be laid, not upon him, but upon his eastern friends. His history of Assyria is much like the Egyptian
mediaeval Arab writers, clothed only in a Greek dre^

of Stein.^ It was formerly supposed that his native dialect must have been a Doric one, Halikarnassos being a Doric colony, and his residence
in Samos was called in to explain his use of Ionic. The discovery by
Mr. C. T. Newton of a decree issued by the assembly of the Halikarnassians and Salmakiteans along with the tyrant Lygdamis, the contemporary of Herodotos, which is written in Ionic, has shown that we
have no need of this hypothesis, and that Ionic was, in the age of the historian, the language of his native town. 2 The only Dorisms which
occur in it are 'A\iKapvaT{e(i}v) and IlavvaTios, survivals from a time
when Doric was still spoken in the place. It is similarly only in the
case of proper names like 'Ay is, 'Apia-Teas, AevrvxtS?/?, that any traces
of a Doric dialect are found in the MSS. of Herodotos, since ya/xopoi
for the Ionic y-qixopoi is not only used by ^skhylos {Suppl. 613), but is merely quoted by Herodotos from the Doric dialect of Sicily (vii.
155); while avewvrat for av(.lvTai (ii. 165) is really an old Ionic form
which survived in Doric alone of the spoken Greek dialects into the
literary age.^

INTRODUCTION. xxxv
The dialect used by Herodotos is known as New Ionic, to distinguish it from the Old Ionic of Homer, as well as the Middle Ionic represented by a few forms, also found in Homer, which stand midway between those of the Old and those of the New. Thus, for instance,
the genitive of the o- declension in -ov, like 8r)fiov, must have been derived from the older genitive in -oio through an intermediate stage in which the semi-vowel was lost, leaving only the two o's, which
afterwards coalesced into the diphthong -ov. Examples of this intermediate form were first pointed out in Homer by Ahrens, who detected
them in such passages as //. ii. 325, xv. 66 ; Od. i. 70, x. 60. Homer, however, contains not only Old and Middle Ionic forms, but New
Ionic forms as well ; and on closer inspection it will be seen that the
archaic portion of his vocabulary, in which, for example, the digamma
is preserved, is comparatively small, the greater part of his language
being in no way distinguishable frqm the dialect of Herodotos. It is
often assumed that this is in great measure due to conscious imitation
of the Epic dialect on the part of Herodotos ; and Stein accordingly, in the summary above referred to, gives a number of words and grammatical forms which he is supposed to have borrowed from Epic literature. But, as Mr. Paley has pointed out, many of these words,
such as dk\o<f)poveiv, dvrjKoxxTTeiv, irapalSdWea-dai, dreovTes, belong to
prose rather than to poetry ; while others either present no special
characteristics of antiquity, or form an integral part of the structure of the language which Herodotos employs. The oracles, moreover, quoted by Herodotos, which belong to the generation immediately preceding his own, cannot be distinguished from the hexameters of the
Ilkid and Odyssey in either language, style, or metre. The sharp line of division, accordingly, which has been drawn between the language of Homer and that of Herodotos cannot be maintained ; nor are we justified in believing that the language of Herodotos embodied archaic words and grammatical forms which he had derived from his study of Epic poetry. The archaisms of Homer are rather survivals from
earlier poetry, embedded, like flies in amber, in the current language
of a later date.^

Herodotos tells us that in his time four different dialects were
spoken in Ionia (i. 1 42) ; the inscriptions that have been preserved,
however, are too scanty, or the differences were too slight, to allow us
to substantiate his statement. Enough have been discovered, never

dialect as spoken in Ionia and at Halikarnassos in the sixth and fifth
centuries B.C.—tliat is, in the age of Herodotos. We find that the
symbol of the aspirate had come to express the long &, from which we may infer that the aspirate had been lost in Ionic pronunciation. The
use of the v eplielkystikon exhibits the same inconstancy as in older
Attic, though it is more frequent in the earlier than in the later in
scriptions, so that the editors who have expunged it from the text of
Herodotos have fallen into error. The Halikarnassian inscription lately published by Mr. Newton, has aid, not aei ; and Stein has been proved to be right in defending the forms kcivos and 6kkb> against Dindorf
and Bredow. On the other hand, raora appears for ravra at Halikar
nassos, and, as Erman points out, the coalescence of e with a following
c, 7/, or 61 into one syllable, distinguished the dialect of Miletos and the
Khalkidian colonies as far back as the sixth century B.C., that of
Halikarnassos in the middle of the fifth century, that of Euboea in the beginning of the fifth century, and that of Thasos in the beginning of
the fourth. E and o are not contracted into a single syllable until we come to the middle of the fourth century B.C., when the diphthong cu makes its appearance, probably through the influence of the Attic ov ; and ecu is written in full except when preceded by v and i. Consequently Dindorf and Abicht must be wrong in always writing the
full form eo) in the texts of Herodotos, as well as Stein and Bredow, who admit the elision of c only where another c precedes.^ The
contracted form Ipos for lepo?, again, does not appear before the fourth century B.C., and should therefore be expunged from the editions of Herodotos, while we find yeas instead of yijs. We also meet with
forms of the dative plural like ya-iv, NvfKJirja-Lr, At'oio-tv, by the side of
Toi? Seois TovTOL'i, but the genitive singular of the o-declension always
ends in ov. Stems in 6 and v form their genitives in tos and vos, until
we come to the fourth century, when the Attic ews first creeps in. On
the other hand, so-called Attic forms like 'Av-a^tAews occur in the oldest
Ionic inscriptions. At Halikarnassos the dative singular is TroAet,
Tet;^fi. From stems in cos we get IIAovt^os, Upir/vTJt. as well as
'AxiAAeos. Coming to the verb we find Lhardy justified in rejecting Ixov from the text of Herodotos by 6?xov, eTx^v in the Halikarnassian
inscriptions ; the participle of the substantive verb is eciv, edin-os— the
contracted form not coming into use till late in the fourth century
;

and y, not cy, is met with at Halikamassos. Here, too, we find ottoi-, not oKov, which suggests that the labial found in Homer is not due to Attic influence, and that the guttural of Herodotos did not come from
the dialect spoken in his birthplace.
This raises the (question whether we are justified in correcting the
text of Herodotos in accordance with the evidence of the Ionic inscrip
tions of his age. The existence of dialects in Ionia at the time, and our ignorance as to which of these Herodotos may have used, or whether he combined forms found in two or more of them, teach us the necessity of caution. But on the other hand the evidence of our
MSS. is not consistent, and is frequently uncertain ; the oldest of them
can hardly be earlier than the tenth century of our era, and the errors introduced by copyists, or ignorant grammarians bent on restoring what they supposed to be Ionic forms, are necessarily numerous. In
an inscription we are, at all events, secure of having the very words
that were written by the engraver, Wliere, therefore, a grammatical form may be considered to have been used throughout Ionia in the time of Herodotos by the concurrent testimony of the inscriptions found in various localities, we ought to have no hesitation in preferring
it to the traditional form handed down in our texts, supposing this
to be different. Thus, for example, the contracted form of the
participle of ct/xi given here and there in the MSS. is clearly proved
by the inscriptions to belong to a later period, and to have no right to
appear in the pages of Herodotos. On the other hand, Merzdorf objects that a distinction should be made between the more popular and negligent language of inscriptions, and the more careful mode of expression adopted by a literary man. But it is only on the tombstones of the poorer class of people that such a negligent kind of language is likely to appear. Public decrees
and official texts would certainly be composed in as careful a style as
the work of a literary man ; indeed, considering their importance and
public character, as well as their comparative brevity, they would probably be written still more carefully. We do not usually find the language of Parliament or the law-courts either popular or simple. At the same time there was no such gulf between the literary language of Herodotos and the ordinary speech of the day, as was the case in the Alexandrian period. Indeed, we now and then come upon awkwardnesses of grammar, to use a mild term, which would not have been tolerated in a public document.^ Old forms and words are quite
as likely to occur in inscriptions as in the history of Herodotos. At
e.g. singular verb for plural (ffx^/wt lhpSapiK6f), i. 26, iL 66 (raOra Si yiv6fiera).

INTRODUCTION. xxxix
tlie same time, Stein is doubtless right in protesting against the nssumption that the language of Herodotos must be uniform. Modern
^\•rite^s, who vary the spelling of a few words in their MSS., should
not require a greater unifonnity in the "father of history." But it is
also clear that this variation should be kept within bounds. In a
large proportion of instances it is more reasonable to suppose it due
to the mistakes of copyists, or the zeal of grammarians, than to the
author himself.
The inscriptions, then, must be allowed to amend the text in either one of two cases. When they show that a later form did not come into use in Ionic until the fourth century B.C., all examples to the contrary must be excised from the pages of Herodotos. Thus the/
contraction of aUi into dec, of itpos into lp6<;, of yeas into y^s, of co into \ vy*^
€v, and of €0) into w, is proved to belong to a period later than his. ' Where, again, they present us with a later form which is found in the
MSS. side by side with an older one, we are warranted in considering that both may have come from the pen of the author. On the other hand, we cannot expunge older forms from the text merely because
they do not occur in the extant inscriptions. The co- existence of
datives like Aioicrtv and Oeots makes it plain that in literary documents earlier and later forms might be used together ; while we cannot be '
sure that the earlier forms did not exist in one of the Ionic dialects even in the age of Herodotos, although unrepresented by the inscrip
tions we possess, or that they were not derived from the older Ionic writers, who had formed the style and literary language which Herodotos followed. Hence it is that we cannot venture to reject examples in which e does not coalesce with a following c, ?;, and ft when they are supported by the united authority of the MSS.
With this limitation and under these conditions, the testimony of
the inscriptions has been allowed its full weight in the text adopted in this present volume, however heretical such a procedure may be
thought by textual critics.^ Stein's text has been taken as a basis, or

by it. The earlier editions, from the princeps of Aldus, printed in 1502, downwards, are only historically valuable; students who are
curious about them will find a list of them in Baehr (vol. iv. pp. 491 sq., 2d edition). Stein has brought out two editions : a smaller one, with annotations on the text, in the Egyptian part of which he was
assisted by Brugsch Pasha (4th edition, Berlin, 1877), and a larger
critical one (Berlin, 18G9), in which the various readings of the MSS.
are given and classified, as well as the fragments of lexicography and the scholia which have been preserved. The introduction contains
a full account of the MSS. in question, and discusses their relative
merit and testimony, with a protest against the attempt to harmonise all the forms given by them. Stein considers the two oldest codices
now extant, the Medicean (A) of the tenth century, and the Angelican
(B) of the eleventh century, to be alike derived from a MS. which was
itself copied from an older one, which was also the ultimate source, but
by a different channel, of the Florentine MS. (C). This lost original,
which he calls X, stood by the side of another lost original termed "*", which was the source, among other MSS., of the Parisian (P), the Vatican (R), and the Sancroftian (S). The latter, though made the
basis of Gaisford's text, is of comparatively late date. Stein pronounces the text of X to have been " rough " and broken, but of value
on account of its high antiquity ; while that of ^ was freer from
lacunce and errors, but full of interpolations. He follows Abicht in making the Medicean MS. the ground work of his edition. Tlios^
who wish further details must consult his introduction.
Stein also promises us a lexicon to Herodotos. This is much needed, as the Lexicon Herodoteum of Schweighaiiser is based on a text
which is now obsolete. Something better is required for settling the
question of the relation of the Homeric to the Herodotean dialect, or of the indebtedness of the latter to Attic grammar. We have yet to
determine how far Hermogenes was right in saying' of Hekata;os,

^ We know from other sources that the Persians had historians who occupied themselves with the history of foreign nations. Ktesias, the gainsayer of Herodotos, professed to draw his information from the Persian archives and historians
;
and the Persian forms of several of the names he gives, as well as the fact that much of what he calls Assyrian " history " is really a rationalised account of Assyrian mythology, show that there was much truth in his claim. As in the case of Assyria, so also in the case of Greece, if we may judge from the specimen in the text, the Persian writers seem to have troubled themselves with little else than the myths of their neighbours, which they rationalised after the fashion of the Abbe Banier. Hence Herodotos was fuUy justified in calling them \6710t " prosers." The alphabet in which they wrote is unknown to us, since the cuneiform alphabet introduced by Darius Hystaspis was used only for public monuments. How Herodotos came to be acquainted with their statements is difficult to conjecture, since he was not likely to have a better knowledge of Persian language than he had of B
Egyptian. The Greeks were notoriously bad linguists, and Themistokles stands almost alone in learning Persian. In fact Ktesias implied that Herodotos was not acquainted with the contents of Persian literature. Though born, according to Dionysios of Halikarnassos, a little before the Persian wars, he was a mere child when the deliverance of the Asiatic Greeks took place. At the same time, passages like iii. 80, or i. 95, may imply a closer acquaintance with the Persian language and literature upon his part than we are inclined to suppose. From what follows, however, he would seem to have had much the same knowledge of the statements of Phoenician historians as he had of those of Persia. It is possible, therefore, that Greek translators of foreign literature, like Menander of Ephesos, already existed among the Asiatic Greeks of his day. At any rate the earliest Ionic philosophers derived their doctrines from Babylonia through the medium of either the Phoenicians or the Lydians. The systems of Thalea and Anaximander, for instance, had long been anticipated in Babylonia, where they fitted in with the mythology and

theological and philosophic development of the country. The style of the earliest Greek writers is as oriental as their matter. The short sentences, either devoid of conjunctions or connected by the simple "and," are Semitic, not Greek, in character. So, too, are the obscure and oracular utterances of a Herakleitos. 2 The " Red Sea " of Herodotos is the Indian Ocean, including the Persian Gulf. According to vii. 89, the Phoenicians themselves asserted that they came from the Assyrian Gulf. The same is asserted by Strabo, i. 2, 35 ; xvi. 3, 4 ; 4, 27 ; Justin, xviii. 3, 2 ; Pliny, N. H. iv. 36 ; Dion. Periegetes, 906 ; Solinus, Polyhist. 26 ; [Steph. Byz. s. v. 'Afwroj] ; Schol. to Hom. Od. iv. 84. Kepheus, i.e. Kef-t, the Egyptian name of Phoenicia, is made a Babylonian monarch, who gave his name to the Chaldeans (Hellanikos, Fr. 159, 160, ed. Miiller). Justin says that the Phoenicians migrated from their old homes on account of an earthquake, and settled by "the Assyrian Lake" (the Sea of Nedjif). Strabo places Phoenician cities in the islands of Tyros and Arados {Bahrein), iu the Persian Gulf. But the similarity of name probably gave rise to the whole legend, the true name of the island of Tyros being Tylos (according to Ptolemy and Pliny), while Tjrre was properly Tsur, "the rock." The Phoenician Arados was really Arvad. The tradition, however, rested on fact, since philological evidence shows that the primitive seat of the Semites was in Arabia, on the western side of the Euphrates (see Hommel, "Die Namen der Saiigethiere bei den SiidsemitischeQ
Volkem," 1879; Guidi, "Delia Sede primitiva dei Popoli Semitici," 1879), whence the Phcenicians moved westward, settling on the coast, which they called Canaan, or " the lowlands," in contradistinction to the "highlands" of Aram. Agenor (Baal), the father of Phcenix, was also called Ehna, and Philo Byblios stated that Khna changed his name to Phcenix (Euseb. Prcep. Ev. i. 10). Eupolemos made Kanaan the father of Phcenix (Euseb. PrcBp. Ev. ix. 17) ; while S. Augustine says that the Phoenician settlers in Africa called themselves Canaanites {Ep. ad Rom. Op. iii. p. 932). Phoenicia is called Canaan on a coin of Laodikeia, and in Isaiah xxiii. 11 (A. V.,
'
' merchant city "), * This is strictly true, and shows that the legends quoted by Herodotos had a historical basis. Phoenician art and culture are a mixture of Egyptian and "Assyrian" {i.e. Babylonian), and the discoveries made at Mykense and on other prehistoric sites show that the objects brought to Greece by Phoenician traders were partly Babylonian and partly Egyptian in character. * This statement, again, has been confirmed by Dr. Schlieniann's excavations at Mykenas, if we understand by Argos the Argolis, with its feudal capitals of Tiryns, Mykense, and Argos, which mark successive epochs in tlie history of Akhaean }K)wer and civilisation. In the Peloponnesos, at all events, the Akhnean dynasty of Mykenie took the lead. The Argolis was naturally the first part of the country to which the art and culture of Asia were brought across the sea. It is noteworthy that Argos is here made

the leading power of prehistoric Hellas, and not Kadmeian Thebes, which Greek legends connected with the dissemination of the alphabet and Phcenician civilisation, or the neighbouring capital of the Minyans at Orkhomenos. The extent of the Akropolis on the latter site shows that at one time the Minyan power must have been as great as that of the Akhaeans ; while the beehive tomb, known as the Treasury of Minyas, proves that the period in question coincided with the latter portion of the prehistoric period of Mykenee. It is clear, therefore, that the Minyans of northern Greece must have been quite as powerful a people as the Akhaeans, and at the same time (as was natural, from the proximity of Phoenician Thebes) a more cultured people, but only during the later part of the prehistoric age in Argolis. The statement, accordingly, made by Herodotos, which relates to the beginning and not to the close of Akhsean supremacy, is strictly accurate. • SiarlOfffOai " arrange for rule. " Cp. eh. 194 : also Od. 15, 415. • Id may be derived, like 'Idovcs, from the root ya, "to go," and signify " the wanderer." At any rate, she was origin
ally the moon goddess, watched by Argos, "the bright" sky, with his myriad eyes of stars. When the name of the city Argos (really derived from a different root from that of dpybs, 'A.pyu, dpyevvbs, argentum, etc. ) was confounded with the old epithet of the sky, the myth of 18 was localised in the Argolis, and Id herself made the daughter of the Argive river, Inakhos. ' EurSpa was the Phcenician moon goddess, Astarte or Ashtoreth, "with the crescent horns," wooed by the sun god, whose symbol was the bull. Hence she was the daughter of Phoenix, " the Phcenician," also called Khna, "Canaan," or Agenor, the Greek rendering of the Phoenician Baal Melkarth, and the sister of Kadmos, "the eastern." The name
EurSpa was first given to " the broad " plain of Thebes, occupied in early times by Phoenician Kadmeians, and from hence was gradually extended to denote the whole of the European continent. The legends connected with the name of Miuos show that Krctc was at one time uccupied by Phoenician settlements. " ha <r(pt, etc, "tit for tat." Cp. ix. 48 ; Soph. JrUig. 142.

® i.e. Krcesos. The scepticism of Herodotos in regard to the assertions of oriental writers seems to have been in the mind of Ktesias when he claimed superior authority for his own statements as being derived from the Persian archives. The history given by Herodotos is parodied by Aristoph. Akharn. 523 sq. ^ The Syrians here are the "White Syrians " of Strabo, whom the Greek geographer contrasts with the Black Syrians, or Semitic Arameans, east of the Amanus (Strab. pp. 533, 544, 737. See Schol.
ad ApoU. Rhod. i. 948). We now know that they were really the Hittites of Carchemish, who did not belong to the Semitic race at all, and had originally descended from the mountainous region of the north. They have left monuments behind them at Boghaz Keui (? Pteria) and Eynk (? Tavium), on the east bank of the Haly& Herodotos tells us (i. 72, vii. 72) that the inhabitants of Kappadokia and Kilikia were Syrians, and Hittite remains in the shape of sculptures and inscriptions have been found in these countries. The tribes inhabiting them probably belonged to
the same race as the Hittites, and spoke cognate dialects. SinSpe, according to Skymnos of Khios (943), was founded among the Syrians, and a promontory a little to the north of Sin6pe was called Syrias. Pindar (Fr. 150, ed. Bergk) speaks of "a spear-armed Syrian host" at the mouth of the Therm&d6n, meaning the Amazons, the Hittite priestesses of the Asiatic goddess, Nana-Istar of Babylon, and Atargatis of Carchemish, whose worship they had carried to Ephesos and the west. ^ For the Kimmerians, the Gimirrai of the Assyrian inscriptions, and their inroads in Asia Minor, see Appendix IV. What Eusebios calls the first capture of Sardes by the Kimmerians in b.c. 1078 is probably a tradition of the conquest of Lydia and Sardes by the Hittites before the rise of tlie dynasty of the Herakleids. It is possible that the same event is meant by Strabo (L p. 90), when he says that the Rimmerian chief
Lygdamis ruled in Kilikia — a Hittite
district — while his followers overran Lydia and captured Sardes. According to Hesykhios, Lygdamis burnt the temple of Artemis.

^ The father of Kandaules was Myrsos (Meles in Eusebios). The termination •ilos, therefore, seems to have been gentilic in Lydian. Kav-Saij\rfi was identified with Hermes or Herakles by Hesykhios, and is translated ffKvWowviKrris (Tzetzes in Cramer, Anecd. Oxon. 3, 351) ; cp. Kiiuv, cants, hound, Skt. <^an. Tzetzes quotes a line from Hipponax : 'Ep/t^ Kvvdyxo^ M^octtrTi Koi'SaOXa. Nikolaos Damascenus calls Kandaules Sadyattes.
* The words 6 Nfvoi/ — 'AX*caiou have dropped out of the text in three late MSS. (Stein's R 6 d). As the Assyrians knew nothing of the country west of the Halys before the reign of Assur-bani-pal, and Assur-bani-pal states that when the ambassadors of Gyges arrived at Nineveh (B.C. 660) none knew who they were, or had heard the name of Lydia (Liiddi), or could interpret their language, the names of Ninos (Nineveh) and Belos (BelMerodach of Babylon) cannot refer to an early Assyrian conquest of Lydia. Babylonian art and culture, however, as mmliticd at Carchemish, the Hittite capital, was carried by the Hittitea throughout Asia Minor at the time to which the rise of the Herakleid dynasty would go back, according to the chronology of Herotiotos ; and as Carchemish is called "Ninus vetus" by Ammianua Marcellinus (xiv. 8 ; see, tf>o, Diod. IL 8, 7), it is clear that the genealogy given in the text is a legendary reminiscence
of the Hittite occupation of Lydia and introduction of civilisation and writing among the nations of the west. The Herakleids would seem to have grown into power when the Hittite empire began to decay and could no longer support the satraps of Sardes. Herakles, the sun god of Babylonia and Assyria, the Melkarth of Tyre, had been adopted by the Hittites into their system of worship, like the Asiatic goddess, and then carried into Asia Minor. Hence we find the Lydian name of the deity to have been Sandan (J oh. Lydus, De Mag. iiL 64), the Sandan, Sandes, or Sandakos of the Kilikians and Hittites. With Alkaios, "the strong one," comp. the Alkimos of Xanthos. • The name of Meies or Msednes may be connected with the Lydian /twOi " earth." Comp. also the name of Mseander. • Probably a confusion with the oracle delivered to Gyges (ch. 13). ' lardanos was the husband, or, according to other accounts, the father, of Omphal^, which may pcrhaj)s be the Lydian (or Hittite) name of the Asiatic goddess (the Ephesian Artemis or KybelS). Herakles or Sandan, the sun god, while serving OmphalS, had a son Akelis (or Agelaos) by Malis, or Damalis, one of her slaves (Hcllan. Fr. 102). According to Diodoros (iv. 31), Herakles first had Kleodteos by a slave, then Lamos by Omphale.

' The average of twenty -three years to a reign seems a long one. Herodotos does not mean that a generation lasted only twenty-three years, but that, as son succeeded father regularly, the twentj'two reigns corresponded to twenty-two generations. Xanthos, the Lydian historian, mentioned among them the reigns of Kambles or Kamblitas, who ate his wife while asleep, and Akiamos, whose general, Askalos, founded Askalon, where Mopsos or Moxos, the Lydian, drowned the goddess Atargatis in the sacred lake. Nikolaos Damascenus makes Tyl6n, Sadyatt^, and Lixos the successors of OmphalS. Eusebios (Chron. Can. L 15) makes the four predecessors of Kandaules, (1) Alyatt^ (2) Ardys for thirtysix years, (3) Alyattes II. for fourteen years, and (4) Mel^ for twelve years.
In Nikolaos Damascenus the order is Adyattes I., Ardys, Adyattes II., Meles, and Myrsos, the father of Sadyattes, by whom Kandaules must be meant. In the reign of Ardys a feud broke out between the Herakleidse and the Mermnadae, then represented by Daskylos, son of Gyges, the favourite of Ardys, who was murdered by Adyattes II. In the fifth generation the Mermnad Gyges avenged the murder, excited by fear of punishment for the insult he had oflFered to the daughter of the Mysian prince, Amossos, whom he had been sent to bring to Lydia in order that she might be married to the Lydian king. Considering the meaning of the name EandanlSs, and his identification with the Greek Hermes, it is possible that it was a nickname given to a prince whom Nikolas calls by his real name, Sadyattes.

' This sentence is regarded as spurious by Wesseling and Stein. Aristotle {IiA£t. iii. 17) and Plutarch {Mor. ii. 470 c) quote from Arkhilokhos the following line, which was put into the mouth of one of his characters : OS fwi tA FiVyew TOV iro\vxpiaov fUXei (Fr. 25, ed. Bergk). Arkhilokhos also referred to the destruction of Magnesia by the Kimmerians, and is stated to have been a contemporary of Gyges, and therefore, as Gelzer has shown {Das Zeitalter des Oyges), to have flourished b.c. 687-63. We learn from the Assyrian inscriptions that the Kimmerians first invaded Lydia in the reign of Gyges, not of Ardys, as Herodotos supposed. "With the name of Gyges (Assyrian, Gugu ; Hebrew, Gog), compare the Earian names Gygos and Ida-gygos in the Halikamassian inscription pub
lished by Newton (Essays on Art and Archmology, pp. 427 sq.) * "Most of the silver offerings at Delphi were his." Silver seems to have had a special attraction for the Hittites, whose monuments in Asia Minor are usually met with in the neighbourhood of old silver mines, and their fancy for the metal may have been communicated to the Lydians. In the time of Herodotos gold was to silver as 13^ to 1 (not 13 to 1, as stated in iii. 95, see Mommsen : "Note sur la systeme metrique des Assyriens," appended to the "Hist Mon. Rom.," ed. Blacas, i. p. 407) ; in that of Plato and of Xenophon 10 to 1, owing to the quantity of gold introduced into Greece by the Persian War. See, too, Liv. 38, 11. Under Theodosius II. it was as 18 to 1.

' Midas and Gordios are common names among the Phrj'gian kings. Phrygians and Greeks were allied in both language and race ; and myths which became part of Greek mythology told of a Gordios who was raised from a peasant to be a king, and tied a knot about the yoke of his cart which could be undone only by him who was destined to be lord of Asia ; as well as of a Midas who turned all that he touched into gold, and of whom the reeds whispered that his ears had become those of an ass because he had esteemed the singing of Pan above that of Apollo. Another Midas is made by Eusebios to have ascended the throne in B.C. 738. He married DamodikS, daughter of Agamemn6n, the Greek king of Kyme, and seems to have been the Midas meant by Herodotos. He killed himself by drinking bull's blood when Phrygia was invaded by the Kimmerians. He is probably to be distinguished from the Midas whose tomb was adorned with a bronze image of a girl (Plato, Phccdr. 264 d). Among the tombs of the Phrygian kings in the valley of Doghanlii (between Yazili Kaia and Sidi Ghazi, the ancient PrymnSssos and Midseon) is one at Kumbet, with an inscription of two lines in Phrygian letters, which reads (1) Ates Arkiacvais Akenanogavos Midai gavagtaei vanaktei cdaes ; (2) Baba Memevais Proitavos kphi Zanavezos Sikcneman elaes. This may be translated: "Ates Arkiaevas, the son of Akenanos, built this for Midas the . . the king: Baba Memevais, the son of Proitas, and Zana
vezos, a native of Sikan, planned it." See Mr. W. M. Ramsay's paper on the Phrygian Inscriptions in the "Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society " for 1882. During his visit to Phrygia in 1881 he recopied the inscriptions already known, found others, and discovered a new Phrygian necropolis near Ayazeen, twenty mUes south of that of Midas. * ivei T€, like 6ffTf, StrTH re, oI6j re, 6aos re, SxTTf, uxrel re, dre, Iva re. *0<rre, "and so," shows how the use of the enclitic originated in the primitively demonstrative sense of the relative. 'Eirel is a compound of the preposition fV for ivl, used like the Sanskrit prefix api, and tl for Fei, i.e. a-Fei, from the same root as the reflexive Sanskrit pronoun swa, the Latin sui and si. The original iir-Fd explains the occasional length of the first syllable of iird in Homer. " This was Old Smyrna, on a hill above Burnabat, on the north side of the Bay of Smyrna. The modem Sm}Tna had no existence till the age of Alexander the Great and his successors. Old Smyrna was said to have been built by the Amazons, in whom we may see a tradition of the Hittite occupation of Lydia, along with Ephesos, Kyme, and Myrina. The name of the part of Ephesos which owed its foundation to the Amazons was Samorna or Smyrna, and Mjrrina is apparently the same word, initial <r being lost, as in fuKpSs for cfuxpit. The tomb of the Amazon Myrina was pointed out in the Troad {II. ii. 814). The Amazons were primarily the priest*

The five references are this

Creuzer ingeniously supposes that the myth grew out of the figure dedicated by Arion in the temple of Poseidon (on the site of which now stands the ruined church of the Asomatos). The legend of Apollo Delphinios, and the consequent connection between the dolphin and music, may have induced the poet to choose a figure of a dolphin as his offering. The later coins of Methymne represent Arion sitting on a dolphin. * "Invented the soldering of iron." Objects of soldered bronze belonging to the prehistoric age have been found by Dr. Schliemann at Hissarlik (Troy) and Mykenae. Herodotos, however, is mistaken in saying that the art of soldering iron was first invented by Glaukos, since it was known in Egypt at least as early as the eighteenth dynasty, like the art
of imbricating or lajdng plates of metal one over the other. The art of inlaying or damascening metal was also practised by the Egyptians at this early period (Wilkinson's Ancient Egxjptians, ii. pp. 257-8, ed. Birch). Among the objects found by Dr. Schliemann in the fourth tomb at Mykenae are a silver knife-blade, with figures of men hunting lions inlaid in gold, and a silver goblet similarly inlaid with gold work. Pausanias, who saw the stand of the vase presented by Alyattes to Delphi, describes it as consisting of "several plates of iron, laid one over the other in the form of steps ; the last (those at the top) curving a little outwards. It had the form of a tower, large at the base and decreasing upwards ; and the pieces of which it was composed were not fastened either with nails or with pins, but were simply soldered together" (Paus. x. 16, 1). According to Athenaeus (Deip. v. 13), the vase was inlaid with figures of plants and animals. ' The ancient city included Mount Prion or Pion and a portion of Mount

Koressos along the cliff, on which remains of early Cyclopean walls can still be traced. The temple lay at the distance of about a mile from the Magnesian Gate, which was westward of it and in the valley midway between Prion and Koressos. It would seem that in the time of Herodotos it had been already enclosed by the city wall, though Xenophon still speaks of the temple as being seven stades from the city (Ephes. i. 2). The temple, dedicated to the Asiatic goddess, whom the Greeks identified with their Artemis, has been excavated by Mr. Wood. The original structure went back to the Hittite period ; that of which the ruins now remain was, according to Pliny, the eighth. The sixth, commenced by the architects Khersiphron of Krete and his son Metagenes, occupied nearly one hundred years
in building, and was destroyed the very day Socrates drank the hemlock (b.c. 400). Kroesos had contributed towards its constniction. The seventh was burnt by Herostratos the same night Alexander the Great was bom (b.c. 356). The local character of Greek religion is strikingly illustrated by the action of the Ephesians. The rope locally connected the temple with the city, and so placed the latter under the protection of the goddess. Compare Thukyd. iii. 104 (where Polykrates dedicates Rheneia to Apollo by connecting it with Delos by a chain). Similarly, the conspirators who had aided Kylon at Athens connected themselves with the altar of the Eumenides by a cord, and their removal brouglit a curse upon the house of Megaklcs, the Alkmaeonid, who ordered it. See ch. 61.

* Rejected as a gloss by Stein. The Mariaudyni lay between the river Sangarios {Sakaria) and Herakleia (Ercgli), separated from the mountain-chain of Asia Minor by the Bithynians. They may have been of Thrakian origin (Strabo, vii. 42). The Khalybes, famous as workers in steel (^Eskli. Pr. 715) are placed by Pomponius Mela (i. 21) near Sinope, so that Herodotos would be right in speaking of them as west of the Halys
;
Strabo, on the other hand, put them eastward of the Halys, and here Xenophon (Anab. iv. 6, 7) met them, to the north-west of Lake Van, adjoining the Skythini and near the Phasis. It would seem, therefore, that they once extended over a large tract of country between longitudes 42° and 35° ; as we know, from the Assyiian inscriptions, the Tibareni (or Tubal) and the Moskhi (or Meshech) formerly did. Erzerum would have stood in their territory. The Khalybes were also called Khaldsei by the Greeks (Armenian, Khalti), from their worship of Khaldis, the supreme god of the protoArmenians who have left cuneiform inscriptions in the neighbourhood of Lake Van. The Thynians occupied the coast eastward of Mysia ; the Bithynians being more inland (Pliny, H. N. v. 82). Their Thrakian origin is again mentioned by Herodotos (vii. 75). iEolis was the coastline from the Gulf of Adramyttion to the mouth of the Hermos ; Ionia that
from the Hermos to Miletos, —the Boghaz Pass, a little to the west of Magnesia ad Sipylum, marking their inland limit ; while the Dorians held the south-western extremity of Karia. The C
coast-land of Pamphylia stretched from Korakesion to Phaselis (Tekrwa). It was inhabited by a mixed population, partly Greek, partly native. The inscription of Sillyon, in the corrupt Greek dialect of the country, has been treated by Mr. Ramsay in the Journal of Hellenic Studies, i. (1880). The Pisidians of Pamphylia are first named by Xenophon. The Kilikia of Herodotos extended far to the north of Mount Tauros, the upper Halys flowing through it (i. 72). For the other nations of Asia Minor, see Appendix IV. ^ Sophist did not acquire a bad sense until after the time of Herodotos. According to Isokrates, Solon was the first who was called a "Sophist." The wise men of Greece were generally attracted to the courts where they could find a patron and the chance of making money ; whether the patron was a foreigner or a tyrant mattered little. Solon's travels are not placed beyond the possibility of doubt, and the story told here by Herodotos seems a Greek apologue, intended to contrast the wisdom of the Athenian legislator with the C^pw of the Asiatic potentate. It was especially serviceable to Herodotos in his task of showing how the overweening wealth and power of the first great Asiatic monarch the Greeks were acquainted with brought down upon it the v^fitffn of the gods. No reference is made to the visit by Solon in his iK)ein3. Kroesos did not begin to reign until B.C. 560, and Amasis (alone) till b.c. 564 ; and as Solon seems to have been at Athens when Peisistratos made himself tyrant in B.c. 560, it seema

* Herodotos was an indifferent calculator, as is further shown by his blunder over the number of years required for the Egyptian dynasties (ii. 142). So we need not be surprised that he here makes the solar year consist of 375 days. Prof. Rawlinson has pointed out that this is duo partly to his counting the months at thirty days each, instead of alternately thirty and twenty
nine, and partly to his forgetting that the intercalary month was omitted from
time to time — possibly every fourth

^ That of Ammon. 2 The temple of Apollo of Abae (cp. Soph. (Ed. Tyr. 897-899, and Herod, viii. 134) stood on a low hill to the north-west of the height still surrounded with the massive walls of Abae. The temple was destroyed in the sacred war B.C. 346, and only a single wall of Hellenic masonry now marks its
site. * The excavations of M. Karapanos have shown that the oracle of Dodona stood in the valley of Characovista, eleven miles south-west of Yannina, where he has exhumed the remains of the town, the theatre, and the sacred enclosure. (See his Dodone et ses Euines, 2 vols. Paris, 1878.) * The oracle of Amphiaraos was at Or6pos (Pans. i. 34 ; Liv. 45, 27). See Herod, viii. 134. That of Troph8nios was at Lebadeia (Livadia), in Boeotia, on the slope of the hill now crowned with the walls of a mediaeval fortress, and just above a deep gorge through which
a torrent iiows. The water, as it passes through the small funnels it has worn in the rocks, produces a whistling sound, which may have first suggested the oracle. The approach to the oracle is now covered with earth, but is probably to be found where the lowest wall of the mediaeval fortress approaches the cliff. Brankhidae, now HieroTida, was ten miles from Miletos. The ruins now existing there belong to the temple built after the destruction of an older one by Xerxes. On either side of the road leading to the port, two miles distant, Mr. Newton found the sitting figures, in an archaic Assjrrianising style, which are now in the British Museum. The oracle was a peculiarly Greek institution ; the divine in man was called forth by the stimulus of nature, and revealed itself in prophetic song.
"* "Before they put their questions."

Rawlinson. It miist be noted that the oracles wore to be "written down and arranged " {axrfypa^afUvoxn).

8 A palm was a little over three inches. Inscriptions show that we must read iraXoffTtt, not TrdXeuoro, the reading of all the MSS. except two. ' The MSS. read rpla TnurdXam-a, but the editors have decided that Herodotos did not reckon by half-talents. It is not easy, however, to construe the modem reading. Bahr makes the ingots of pure gold weigh 325 French lbs., and those of x>ale gold 260 lbs. , but his calculations are not wholly certain. ^ Pale or alloyed gold is the usual material of early gold ornaments found in the eastern part of the Mediterranean. Some ornaments lately discovered in an ancient Lydian tomb on the southern side of Tmdlos are of pale gold. Cp. Soph. Antig. 1037.

The latter is mentioned by Philostratos {Fit. Apoll. iv. 31) and Pollux (i. 1, 34). * Theod6ros, the architect, according to Pausanias (iii. 12 ; viii. 14), invented the art of casting in bronze. This, however, was an error of Greek vanity, as the art was practised in Egypt, Assyria, and Phoenicia at an early period. Theoddros was credited with having carved the emerald in the ring of Polykrates. The supposition of K. 0. Miiller, that there were two Samian artists of this name, is wholly gratuitous, and contrary to the plain words of Pausanias.

8 " When Media's king shall be a male, Soft-footed Lydian, by the pool Of pebbly Hermos fly, nor stay. Nor dread the coward's name tliat day."
The Lydians wore shoes, unlike the Greeks, who usually went barefoot or used sandals. Hence the epithet given to Kroesos. The Hermos runs at the distance of 4^ miles from Sardes, between Sardes and the tumuli of Bin Bir Tepfe, the burial-place of the Lydian kings. * "The most distinguished." Cp. ii. 121 f. * The terra "Pelasgian" is used in
two senses by the Greek writers— (1) as denoting certain Greek tribes of Thessaly, Thrake, and Mysia, and (2) as equivalent to our own term "prehistoric." In two Homeric passages (//. ii. 681, xvi. 233) it is applied to AkhiBan Argos in Thessaly, and to Zeus of DodOna, as worshipped by tlie Thes.salian Akhteans. In II. ii. 8403 the Pelasgians are a tribe of Mysia. In the present pa.ssage of Herodotos, as in Thuk. iv. 109, they are reganled as natives of Thrake. But elsewhere in Homer (II. x. 429; Od. xix. 177) the "divine Pelasgians" have passed into
the region of mythology, and a way has been prepared for the use of the name by later writers to denote those populations of Greece and its neighlwurhood which we should now call prehistoric, or whose origin and relationship were unknown. See Herod. L 146, ii. 56, viii. 44, vii. 94, v. 26, vi. 138. Hence the primitive Arkadians were said to be Pelasgians, the mountains of Arkadia being naturally the last refuge of the aboriginal inhabitants of thePeloponnesos, whom the Greeks displaced. The occurrence of the name amoug various tribes of Illyrian origin may be explained by Pischel's derivation of the word from the roots we have in iripav and el/w (ya), so that it would simply mean the "emigrants," like "lonians" ('Idfofei) from ya "to go." • Deukalidn is formed from Deukaloa, like other epithets of the sun-god (Hyperion, ApoUon, or Ajjclion), dct;ica-X6$ being akin to \\o\v-h(vKy^i, xoKv-itvK^t (Od. xix. 521), and the Homeric d-i<i'«n>i "unheroic" and iv-ivKiui "zealously," from the root due ' ' to lead " (Latin, duco). The myth which has attached itself to

the name seems to refer to the ark of the sun-god sailing above the floods of winter. Pyrrha, the wife of Deukalion, is "the ruddy" dawn, the time when men rise again to the work of the day. Deukalion was the father of Protogeneia, "the morning," Amphi-ktyon (like Amphion, from the old Greek dfupos "a cloud") and Hellen. The latter name results from a confusion between Ds.\i), the Ionic eTXi} "heat" (like dpyewSi = d.py€iv6s), and the national name of the Hellenes. • The Eadmeians are usually in Greek writers the Phoenicians of Thebes, afterwards dispossessed by the Greek Boeotians. Kadmos, their leader, was the son of the Phoenician king Agenor or Khna (i.e. Canaan, "the lowlands," a name originally given to the Phoenician coast-land only), and the communicator of the Phoenician alphabet to the Greeks. His wife, Hermione, is the Semitic Kharmon, Hermon, "the Sanctuary." His name means "the Eastern" or "the ancient god," from the Phoenician Kedem ("east" and "ancient"). Ho was worshipped as a god not only at Thebes (Plut. Pelojnd. 19), but also at Sparta (Paus. iii. 15), whither the influence of the Phoenician colony on Kythera had extended, and, under the form of Kadmilos, cormpted into Kasmilos (Kedem el, "he who is before God "), was one of the three Kabeiri of Samothrake. The slayer of the dragon, Kadmos, was himself changed into a serpent, and thus is identical with "the old serpent-god" (-yipuv i<f>lwv) adored in Phoenicia (Nonnios, Dionysiac. il 274, xll 852). A figure of the serpent is carved on a rock in the island of
Thera, and goes back to the time when the island was a Phoenician colony ; while archaic Greek vases represent Kadmos as an old bearded god, furnished with wings, whose human figure terminates in a serpent's tail. It would seem, therefore, that the Phoenicians who colonised Greece and the Mgean carried with them the worship of Kadmos, and might therefore be called Kadmeians wherever they were found. For the Kadmeians at Sparta see Herod, iv. 147, and in Asia Minor, i. 146. The Kadmeians at Athens were said to have been the fugitives from Thebes (Herod, v. 57), but more probably a Phoenician colony existed at Athens in the prehistoric age, the amalgamation of which with the towns on the Akropolls and the Pelasgikon (the modem Pnj'x-hill) created Athens. The plural 'Xdijvai implies the union of more than
one community. — By Pindos is meant the city, not the range of mountains. * The Pelasgi of Thrake would have spoken an lUyrian dialect, those of Thessaly a Greek one. ^ Kreston was in Mygdonia in Thrake (see Steph. Byz. ad voc.) Its inhabitants are mentioned again in Herod, v. 5. In the time of Thukydides (iv. 109) the Krestonians, Bisaltians, and Edonians bordered on the Khalkidic colonies, and are all termed Pelasgiaos (so the passage should be rendered). These Pelasgians spoke two languages or dialects, and "belonged to the Tyrsenians, who once inhabited Leninos and Athens." The latt«r statement contradicts the assertion of Herodotos that they had come from Thessaly, not from Athens and Lemnos.

TheTyrsenians of Mygdonia have nothing to ;do with the Tyrrhenians of northern Italy, except an accidental similarity of name. To draw ethnographical inferences from this is to repeat the error of the ancients, who derived the Tyrrhenians from the Torrhebians of Lydia. Dionysios of Halikamassos was the author of the blunder which identified KrestQn with the Etruscan Krotona (Cortona). • "Who had been neighbours of the Athenians." This refers to the tradition that Attika had once been inhabited by a "Pelasgian," i.e. a prehistoric, population. Plakia and Skylake were eastward of Kyzikos (founded B.c. 780 ?). Perhaps Herodotos derived his statement about them from Aristeas. '^ '
' The Hellenic race has always had the same language ever since it first came into existence.
"
' We must leave Herodotos to har
monise the inconsistent statements that the Hellenic race always spoke the same language, and was a branch of the Pelasgians, which multiplied greatly, and yet that the Pelasgian language differed from the Hellenic, and the Pelasgians themselves were a barbarous people, which never greatly multiplied. His speculations on philology and ethnology are never very profound. * The three periods of the tyranny of Peisistratos extended from B.c. 560 to 527. Herodotos is incorrect in saying that the Athenians were "oppressed and disunited" (not "distracted") under his rule. On the contrary, he had found the country in a state of anarchy, misery, and poverty, in spite of Solon's legislation, and left it united, prosperous, feared abroad, enjoying peace and good laws at home, and intersected with roads ; while Athens itself was adorned with public

• "He made up his quarrel with the opposite party." ' " Which were under any obligations to them." Peisistratos had made good use of the wealth derived from his silvermines on the Strym6n. Five MSS. read TporjiSiaTO, or irpor]S^aTo. The ending of the 3d pers. pi. pluperf. in -eoro is
Homeric and Herodotean, —the termination -oro, which properly followed a consonant only, being extended by analogy to stems ending in a vowel. The form is New-Ionic, not Old-Ionic. Xl/jotuWo/uu literally means "to be in the condition of an alSaHoi to some one on account of services rendered by him." It illustrates the Greek feeling that uo one
performs an act of kindness except under the supposition that it mil be repaid
;
see iii. 139, note 7. ^ The comment of Herodotos is unjust. It is clear that the Athenian people hailed Peisistratos as their deliverer from oligarchy and faction-fights
;
hence the unmolested landing at Marathon, the diflSculty the oligarchs had in getting a force together, and the ease with which it was dispersed by Peisistratos. If the people had objected to his coming, he could never have made his way to Athene • "Under divine inspiration." See iii. 77, iv. 152, viii. 94 ; also iii. 139, iv. 8, V. 92, L 86, iiL 163, L 111.

tempting to correct 'Aitapi^i' into 'Axapvei)t with Valckenaer, since Achamae was close to Pallene (near the modern Garit6), and Plato calls Amphilytos a fellowcountrjrman ( Thcag. 124).
1 " The cast is flung, the net spread ; soon The tunnies dart beneath the moon." The enemies of Peisistratos will soon dart helplessly in his nets, like the coarsest of Mediterranean fish. ' This, of course, refers to the "revenues," some of which were obtained from Attika, others from the silver-mines of Thrake (see v. 23). According to Thukyd. (vi. 54), Peisistratos levied a tax of five per cent on the incomes of the Athenians. Grote mistranslates the "some troops being derived
from Attica, others from the Stry
mon "
!
3 This is inconsistent with the account of Aristotle, according to whom Lygdamis was made tyrant by the dhnos in consequence of an insult received by a certain Telestagoras from the oligarchs. Lygdamis is a Karian name. * Delos underwent a further purification in the winter of B.c. 426, when the Atlienians removed all the corpses that had been buried in it, and ordered that for the future all births and deaths should take place in the neighbouring island of Rheneia (Thukyd. iii. 104). More than half the corpses were shown, by their armour and mode of burial, to have be«n those of Karians (Thukyd. L

8). The Phoenicians seem to have worshipped the sun-god in Delos before the Greeks took possession of the island and introduced Apollo (see Jebb ou Delos, in the Jminuil of Hellenic Studies, i. 1880), though it is difficult for one who has visited the spot to underetand why an insignificant rock, situated between two other islands, and not in the direct line of passengers from Asia to Europe, should have become the centre of a great religious worship. By thus purifying Delos, Peisistratos gave visible i)roof that Athens was at the head of the Ionian world, and we can only wonder how sucli a naval supremacy and })olitical influence could have been acquired in so short a time. The oracles were doubtless stored in the public library Peisistratos established at Athens ; he had banished Onomakritos for forging an oracle of Mousaios (Herod,
vii. 6).
B " Xhou art come, Lykurgos, to my wealthy shrine, The fHend of Zeus and all that are divine
;
I doubt if I shall name tliee god or man, Yet rather go<l, Lykurgos, if 1 can."
Lykurgos, "e xpeller of the wol ves" of nuarchy, seems to belong rather to myth
ology than to history, like the numerous other Lykurgi of Greek legend, the sons of Ares, Boreas, or Herakles. Acconling to Plut. Lyk. 1, the Spartan lawgiver was the son of Eunomos and fiither of Eukosmos. Plutarch begins his life by saying, '
' Concerning the lawgiver, Lykurgos, we can assert absolutely nothing which is not controverted ; there are di£fercnt stories in respect to his birth, his travels, his death, and his mode of proceeding, both jwlitical and legislative
;
least of all is his age agreed upon." Thukydides does not allude to him, but states that the Spartans emerged from desperate disorders 400 years Ix'fore the Peloponnesian War (i. 18). Hellauikos (Strabo, viii. p. 363) eijually ignores him, and ascribes the constitution of Sparta to Eurystheus and Prokles. Institutions are ascribeil to him which show that, like Numa Pompilius at Rome, he was the ideal legislator to whom all the regulations of the later Sparta were referred. He is said to have forbidden the use of gold and silver money, wliich was unknown in Greece till the age of Pheid6n, the iron rings retained at Sparta being the previous medium of exchange through

out the country. The ephors whom he was supposed to have instituted dated only, as we learn from Aristotle, from the time of the first Messenian War, and Grote has shown that the equal division of lands with which Lykurgos was credited was an idea which arose in the age of Agis in the third century b. c. No wonder the oracle hesitated whether to call hira god or man. * Aristotle makes him more than 100 years later (b.c. 880), and along with other writers calls him a Prokleid, whereas, accoi-ding to Herodotos, he would have been an Ageid. Aristotle and others also state that he was regent for Kharilaos, not LabCtas. The peculiarities of the Spartan constitution which turned the state into a military camp were unknown to Krete ; the institutions of Krete agreed with those of Sparta only in so far as the latter might be regarded as the common property of the Dorian race (a senate, irresponsible ephors called koami, an ckklcsia, Periceki called vvi/ikooi, and public slaves called fu/olai). The Kretans, however, had a public meal known as ivifna, furnished at the expense of the state ; but they had no kings, and possessed private slaves {itpatuGnat or /cXijfydrroi).
' In the time of Thukydides (v. 68) the Spartan X6xos or cohort contained 4 pentekostyes and 512 men, the jientekostys 4 euomotise and 128 men. In the time of Xenophon {Hell. vi. 4) the lokhos consisted of only 2 pentekostyes, and the pentekostys of only 2 enomotife and 50 men. The triikas is mentioned only by Herodotos, ami seems to have ceased to exist at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The Syssitia refers to the public meal {<(>eiSLriov) paid for by those who shared it. * The ephors correspond to the tribunes of the people at Rome, and like the latter, gradually usurped the supreme power in the state. As has been already stated, they were really instituted in the time of Theopompos (Arist. Pol. v. 9 ; Plut. Lyk. 7 ). The yipovTe% are the thirty members of the Council, which, as a common Dorian institution, nnist have existeil from the very beginning of the Spartan state. Each member was required to Ihj over sixty years of age. 9 "They (shot) grow up." 'kvi. is used adverbially and separated from its verb, as in Homer, showing that the socalled Homeric tmesis is not necessarily a mark of the Old Ionic dialect Comj). vii. 156, and H. 18, 56.

Ata seems one of the false forms of the Epic dialect, produced by the supposition that yaia at the end of a line was resolvable into y' ala (Journal of Philology, x. 19 (1881), p. 118). *'
' Who quit the order of the kniglits.
"
The statement of Herodotos is contradicted by the better testimony of Xenophon {De Rep. Lac. 4, 3), who says that the ephors elected three Iwrraypirai, and these chose the 300 knights from among the Spartan youth. As the ephors were changed every year the election must have been annual. Stein quotes the verse in the Elym. Ma,g. 417 : 4x' Afx*
fUya ffSifia. 5 " Should continue in active service, being sent in different directions by the Spartan community." • The employment of iron in the place of bronze was of comparatively late date among the Greeks, as among other nations
of the world. Even in the middle of the sixth century B.C., it would appear, the forging of iron was a novelty to the Spartans, among whom there was little trade or manual labour ; and smiths and smithies continued to be called x<i^f«* and xa^'f"s throughout Greece after the use of iron became general. The fact bears upon the date of the Homeric Poems, which are well acquainted with the use of iron, and effectually disposes of the legend which ascribed to Lykurgos the introduction of iron rings into Sparta as a medium of exchange (see note 6 on ch. 65). ' The verb ffwixuffo. shows that aop6^ here means "a sepulchral chamber" or ** tumulus " rather than "a coffin." The bones were evidently those of some fossilised animal, like the bones of the Dun Cow slain by Guy of Warwick, preserved at Warwick Castle. Similar notions of

the size and strength of the ancient heroes are found in Homer {e.g. 11. 1, 272 ; 5, 304). ' "He wished to rent the courtyard from the latter, who at first would not give it up." " This seems to be an error. Theopompos {Fr. 219) states that the Spartans had sent for the gold in order to cover the face of the image of Apollo, at Amyklse, with it, and Pausanias (iii. 10) actually saw the statue (which was 45 feet high) at Amyklte. Thomax was a mountain on the road from Sparta to
Sellasia. The Spartans were ready enough to help an Asiatic despot who had conciuered their brother Greeks of Ionia ; they were not so e<]ually ready afterwanls to assist Athens when threatened by Persia, ^ The bronze bowl must have been made in imitation of the Phceniko-Hellenic or "Corinthian" ware, which was similarly adorned with the figures of animals. This was a favourite Phoenician mode of decoration, and characterised both their pottery and their work in metal. The embroidery of Thera,

* Kappadokia was bounded on the west by the Halys, and on the south by the Kilikians. Its area is larger in the Persian cuneiform inscriptions, where it is called Katpaducca or Katapatuka (comp. Kat-aonia). The important Hittite remains at Eyuk and Boghaz Keui are within its borders, and there is plenty of evidence that it was at one time the headquarters of the Hittite race. They must be the White Syrians of Strabo, whom the Greek geographer contrasts Avith the Black Syrians of Semitic Aram (pp. 533, 544, 737. Cf. Schol. ad ApoU. Rhod. i. 948). Pindar (Fr. 150, ed. Bergk) speaks of "a siiear-armed Syrian host " at the mouth of the Thermodon (compare Herod, ii. 104), the river on whose banks dwelt the Amazons, the Hittite priestesses of the Asiatic goddess ; and Sinope, according to Skymnos of Khios (943), was founded among the Syrians. But these Syrians were really Hittites, so called as coming from the country known to the Greeks as Syria. The Aramaic legends on the coins of SinOpe, Side, and Kotyora or Gazir (Brandis, MUnzwesen, 808, 427), belong to a later period. See also Herod, vii. 72. Strabo states that the language of the Kataonians was the same as that of the White Syrians. The Aryans, who afterwards occupied Kappadokia, belonged to the wave of migration which brought the Aryan Anneni
ans into Armenia, and the Aryan Medes into Media, in the seventh century B.C. Phaniaspes, king of Kappadokia, married Atossa, sister of Kambyses, king of Persia, according to Diodorus Siculus ; but as he is also said to have been five generations distant from Darius Hystaspis, the statement cannot be correct (see iii. 68, note 4). The names of the early Kappadokian kings, however, are Persian, as well as the deities worshipped in Kappadokia in the Persian period (Omanes, Anandatis, and Anaitis). See ch. 77. * The Kilikia of Herodotos extended considerably to the north of the Taunis range. Herodotos puts the Matieni (of Lake Urumiyeh) far too much to the west. ' The pedestrian would certainly require to be "well equipped." As the distance is 280 miles, and Herodotos makes 200 stadia (about 23 miles) a day's caravan journey (iv, 101), either his geography or his arithmetic is at fault. It is very possible, however, that Professor Mahaify may be right both here and in ii. 34 in reading fifteen for five, fifteen days being equivalent, according to eastern modes of reckoning, to the real distance. He supposes that the original text was ANAPIIEHMEPAI, and that one of the two iota^ has fallen out (Hermathena, vii. 1881). Comiwire also i. 185 (where Yitringa suggests t'e (fifteen) instead of «').

625, 610, 603, 597, and 585. The last date best suits the chronology and history of the period. Pliny (JV. H. ii. 53) makes it B.C. 583. Herodotos seems to wish to contrast the science of the Greeks with the ignorant superstition of the "barbarians." * The "mediators" were Syennesis of Kilikia, and Labynetos of Babylonia. Syennesis was a common name among the Kilikian kings (Herod, v. 118, vii. 98 ; Xenophon, Anab. i. 2 ; jEskh. Pcrsce, 324). Other kings of Kilikia (called Khilak in the Assyrian inscriptions and on the native coins) were, Pikhirim, B.C. 854 ; Ambaris or Amris of Tubal (Tibareni), made king by Sargon, b.c. 712 ; and Sanda-sarme, b.c. 660 (whose name is compounded with that of Sandan, the Kilikian Herakles). Tarkondemos or Tarkondimotos, father and son, ruled Kilikia in the time of Augustus. Tarsus, called Tarzi by Shalmaneser (b.c. 833), was supposed to have had an Assyrian origin, and to have been built in imitation of Babylon. If so, it must have
been a restoration of the older city of Shalmaneser's age. Labjmetos is clearly for Nabynetos, or Nabonidos (Nabunahid), a copyist having mistaken N for A. (See ch. 77. ) As Nabjmetos did not become king of Babylon till B.C. 555, Herodotos has given the WTong name. Nebuchadrezzar was really king at the time. Labynetos is placed on the same footing as Syennesis, and therefore could hardly have been merely a Babylonian official. As such, moreover, he was not likely to have had much weight with the hostile kings. ^ The custom of confirming an oath or contract by drinking one another's blood is widely spread (see iv. 70). In Chinese secret societies blood is drawn from the finger of the candidate for admission, poured into a bowl of wine or water, and drunk by the rest of the society. Tacitus describes the same custom as prevailing among the Georgian and Kaukasian tribes {Ann. xiL 47). ' "The bridges that really are there." Herodotos seems to be here contrasting

came a snake (Ov, M. xv. 389). The horse was of eastern origin, and was accordingly called by the Accadians "the animal of the east," in contradistinction to the ass, "the animal of the west." The honour of having first tamed the horse belongs either to the Tatars or to the primitive Aryans. 2 The Hyllos flows into the Hermos from the north, westward of Magnesia ad Sipylum. Consequently the plain meant by Herodotos is not the Sardian plain properly so called, east of Sardes and south of the Hermos, but the plain west of Sardes and north of the Hermos.
If the battle really took place here, Kyros must have managed to slip past Sardes. The Hermos now flows into the sea to the south of its older channels, one of which is used as a road. An extensive delta has been formed at its mouth, apparently since the time of Herodotos. The Hermos rises from two sources in the Alurad Dagh, a branch of the Taurus, in the ancient Phrygia, called Dind)rma in classical times. The Dindymenian mother is Kybelfi or Kyb€be, the Asiatic goddess, whose worship seems to have been carried to the west by the Hittites and who had a shrine on Mount Dindyma.

* Tlie camel, called '
' the beast of the sea," i.e. the Persian Gulf, by the Accadians, came originally from Arabia. Tlie dislike of the horse to it still continues, as travellers in the east are well able to testify. •* Thyrea, not represented by the monastery of S. Luke, as Leake supjjosed, was the chief town of Kynuria, " the borderland " between Lakonia and Argolis. The Kyniu-ians claimed to belong to the pre-Dorian lonians of the PeloponnSsos. See Thukyd. v. 41,
* In the time of Plieid6n. The whole country was gi-adually absorbed by the Similans when they were still aiming at i)os8cssing themselves of the Peloponnesos, before their check at Tegea led them to change their policy and come forward as simply the leaders of the Dorian race. Kythera had been occupied by the Phoenicians, who built a temple to Astarte there, but were driven out by the Dorians, like the Phoenician colonists elsewhere (in Thera, Melos, Thebes, etc.)

' The lion was the symbol of Sardes, and of its protecting deity, the sun-god. The acropolis, composed of crumbling sandstone, has now been almost entirely washed do^vn into the plain below, and it is clear that the breach mentioned by Herodotos must have been a spot where a landslip had occurred. The Meles meant here can hardly have been the last king but one before Kandaules, but rather the mythical Meles of the Atyad family who was deposed by Moxos on account of his tyranny. 8 i.e. on the south side, where alone the approach to the top of the acropolis is at present not precipitous. ^ According to Ktesias (Polysenos, Strat. vii. 6), Kyros took Sardes through
the advice of (Ebares, figures of men being placed on long poles and raised to the top of the walls. This must have been the Persian account. The Lydian account is also given by Polysenos. According to this, Kyros agreed to a truce and pretended to withdraw, but the following night returned and scaled the unguarded walls with ladders. As Xenophon gives the same account as Herodotos {Kyrop. viiL 2), it would seem to be the Greek version. The introduction of the myth of Meles and the lion makes it suspicious.

' We are reminded of the legends of Christian martyrs, ordered to be burnt, whom the fire would not injure. Compi also the account of the Three Children in the fiery furnace. The legend of Krcesos is further embellished in Nikolaos of Damascus. Here we are told that the son of Krcesos, who had been dumb, wished to die with him, and when prevented prayed to Apollo to save his father ; that the Sibyl appeared and ordered the Persians to desist from the deed ; and that it was the Persians, and not KvTos, who from the first had pitied his prisoner and tried to save him from the anger of his enemies, who were moved by the name of Solon. Fourteen Lydians had been selected to be burnt with Krcesos. The storm terrified the
Persians, and they thenceforth began to observe the law of Zoroaster, which forbade the burning of dead bodies or any other pollution of firo. This last statement may point to the fact that Kyros was not a Zoroastrian, as we now know (see Appendix V.) was the case, and consequently was not likely to venerate fire. Thales had predicted the storm, and the fetters with which Krcesos had been bound were sent by him to DelphL The whole story, it is clear, has been coloured, if not invented, by the vanity of the Greeks. Ktesias says nothing about the fire, but asserts that the fetters of I Krcesos were miraculously struck oflF by thunder and liglitning, after which he was treated kindly by Kyros, and allowed to live at Barene (Barke in Justin. L 7).

' Ao|<aj has nothing to do with Xof6t in the sense of "ambiguous." The fonn is difficult to explain if derived from the root of Xfyw. Frohde compares it, along with Ao^ci, an epithet of Artemis, with the Sanskrit lakhsh-man, "mark," "sign." As the epithet is applied to both Apollo and Artemis, it is better to
regard it as coming from the root of \tvK6i, Kretan ACrros (= AiJrros), Itix, light, the vowel being changed through a "popular etjTiiology," which con
nected it with either Xofdi or \6ryoi. Schbne (Hermes, ix.) ingeniously infers from the oracle that the fall of Sardes was regarded as a fixed date. Hcrodotos

*" ** His father having handed it over to him." ' The instrument had iron teeth, like a carding-comb, over which the victim was dragged. According to Nikolaos Dam., the "enemy" who incited Pantaledn was a merchant named Sadyattes. * The gold-dust washed down from Tm81os by the PaktSlos must be distinguished from the gold found in the mines
of TmSlos.—Ola re as in Homer {eg. n. 7, 280). ' The tomb lies on the southern bank of the Gygaean Lake, and is the highest of all the multitudinous tumuli or tombs on the plateau of the Bin Bir Tepe. It is a conspicuous object from the acropolis of Sardes, and is entirely composed of earth. On the top is a huge block of stone (about 9 feet in diameter) cut into the form of a pomegranate or phallus. The mound has been partially excavated by Spiegelthal and Dennis, and a sepulchral chamber discovered in the middle, composed of large well-cut highly-polished blocks of white marble. The chamber is 11 feet long, nearly 8 feet broad, and 7 feet high. The mound, which had been \ised in later times for burial purposes, is 281 yards in diameter, or about half a mile in circumference. Texier makes it 80 metres high, with 2,650,800
metres of cubic contents. ' The stone base is no longer visible. As described by Herodotos the tomb will have resembled the "Cucumella" tomb at Vulci, as well as the tomb of Porsena at Clusium described by Pliny (N. H. xxxvL 19). The perpendicular height of the great pyramid of Kheops is 482 feet, and it covers an area of nearly 13 acres. * "Monumental stones" bearing inscriptions. No trace of writing remains on the stone now on the top of the tumulus. The Lydian alphabet was, like the alphabets of Karia, Lykia, Pamphylia, and Kappadokia, based on the Greek alphabet, with characters retained from the older Asianic syllabary (which continued to be used in Kypros down to the fourth century B.C.), in order to express sounds not represented in the Phoeniko-Greek alphabet. A sjiecimen of the Lydian alphabet survives in the five characters on the base of a column belonging to the earlier temple of Artemis at Ephesos, discovered by Mr. Wood (published in the TrcmaaeHaM of tht Society of Biblical Archceology, iv. 2, 1876). Mr. Newton jjoints out that the base belonged to one of the "ceelata columnse " presented by KroBsos. 7 "Stating how much each class of workmen had executed."

^ This was also the case .in Babylonia (see Herod, i. 199), and in other paiis of the Semitic world, where the girls consecrated themselves in this way to Astarte. We must notice that according to Herodotos it was only "the common people " whose daughters practised this Semitic custom. The custom may have been introduced by the Hittites along with the worship of the Asiatic goddess. * The lake, now called that of Mermereh, was dried up during a hot summer a few years ago, and the remains of some "pile-dwellings" found in it. It is famous for its carp, which grow to a great size, and in the belief of the natives cause fever when eaten, unless "a bitter stone" in their heads is first taken out. 1 According to Pollux (ix. 6) coined money was invented by the Phrygians. The first coins used in Egypt were introduced by the Persians, as were also the first known in Babylonia and Assyria. The Jews had none before the age of the Maccabees, and none have been found in Phoenicia older than the Persian period. The early coins found near Sardes are of gold, silver, and electrum, and some of them may be older than th« time of Eruesos. They have a de

qiiadratutn inmsum left by the square excrescence of the anvil on which they were struck. The coins of Pheiddn of Argos were imitated from those of Lydia, though Greek vanity afterwards ascribed the invention to him, and bore upon them the figure of a tortoise, the symbol of Aphrodite, and the very animal with which Krcesos was supposed to have tested the veracity of the Delphian oracle. The iEginetan scale of Pheidfin was of oriental origin, like its standard the mna or mina, which goes back to the Accadian mana, subsequently borrowed by the Babylonians and Assyrians, and handed on by them to the West. The Babylonian silver mina is further identical with the silver mina of Carchemish, the Hittite capital, and the mina in use in Asia Minor, and weighed about 8656 gi-ains Troy. Fifty Lydian silver staters (each weighing 173 grains) make one of these minas. This mina was also employed among the PhrygoThrakian mining tribes, who must hare brought it from Asia Minor, and Dr. Schliemann has discovered at Troy (Hissarlik) six wedges of silver, 7 or 8 inches long by 2 in breadth, each of which Mr. Barclay V. Head has shown to be the third of the Babylonian or Hittite mina. This was divided by three, not halved and quartered like the Phoenician standard, which weighed about 11,225 grains Troy.

* Xanthos, the native Lydian historian, not only knows nothing about this colonisation of Etruria, but calls Tyrrhenos Torrhebos or Torybos, and makes him the founder of a Lydian city and the eponym of a Lydian tribe. Dionysios of Halikamassos states that the Etrurians and Lydians differed completely in "language, customs, and religion," a statement fully confirmed, so far as language is concerned, by the Etruscan inscriptions on the one side, and the Lydian words preserved in classical authors on the other. Etruscan was agglutinative and sui generis: Lydian belonged to the Helleno-Phrygian branch of the Aryan family. Mommsen points out that the great cities of Etruria are inland, rather than on the sea -coast; while Etruscan inscriptions have been found as far north as Botzen, and the vocalisation of the language becomes more corrupted the further we advance south. There may be a connection between the Rhaeti of the Alps and Rasena, the native name of the Etruscans. The legend of the Lydian colonisation of Etruria seems to be a Greek one, occasioned by the similarity of Tyrrheui or Tyrseni, the Greek corruption of the native name of the Etruscans, and Torrhebos, easily changed into Tyrrh6no8,
the mythical Lydian prince. In ch. 163 Herodotos himself allows that the Phokaeans first made the name of Tyrrhenians known in Asia Minor. ' Atys or Attys was the Lydo-Phrygian sun-god wooed by Kybele, as Tammuz or Addnis by Aphrodite (Astarte), and served by his eunuch priests the Galli. Agdistis is another form of his name. Manes or Manis was the Phrygian Zeus, called Masdes (Ahuramazda) by the Persians, according to Plutarch {de Is. et Os. p. 360 b). * Draughts was an ancient Egyptian game, both board {sent) and men (ab) being figured on the monuments and found in the tombs. A board found at Thebes, and preserved in the Abbott C!ollection, is given by M. Prisse d'Avennes in Monuments igyptiens, p. 9. A similar game, called the game of the vase, was also played in Egypt as early as the fifth dynasty. Odd and even Mras played with astragali, and various games of ball were known from an early period. No dice, however, have been found in Egypt before the Roman epoch ; but an ivory die of rectangular shai)e, with its four sides covered with numerals in the cuneiform character, has been discovered at Nimmd (Calah) in Assjria.

" The Alpis and Karpis flow into the Danube north of Umbria, according to iv. 49. Herodotos, therefore, must have included Lombardy in the district. • See Appendix V. Once more reference is made to Persian authorities wnth whom Herodotos must have been acquainted (see ch. 1). The three contradictory legends of Kyros show how soon he had become a hero of popular mythology, like Charlemagne in the middle ages. The legend chosen by Herodotos is simply the old solar story which was told of Perseus, of Romulus, and of so many other m3rthic heroes. It is doubtful whether the account given by Xenophon in the Kyropoedeia is one of the three meant by Herodotos, since the Kyros of Xenophon is merely the Greek writer's ideal of w^hat a royal
warrior ought to be. It is evident that Herodotos has in view other Greek historians who had adopted different accoimts of the birth and bringing up of Kyros ; in opposition to these he asserts that he is going to relate "the real history." 7 See Appendix II, From ch. 177 it would seem that the "upper Asia" of Herodotos was Asia between the Tigris and the Mediterranean, exclusive of Asia Minor west of the Halys, or "Lower Asia." What Berdsos calls the Assyrian djmasty, reigning 526 years, cannot be the Assyrians of this passage, since (1) the dynasty of B^rdsos ruled only in Babylonia, and (2) it ended B.C. 747, two years before the rise of the Second Assyrian Empire ; while the supremacy of the Assyrians in Western Asia dates

from at least as early a period as the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I. (b.c. 1130), and closes after the death of Assurbanipal (b.c. 640 ?), with two periods of partial eclipse in the eleventh and eighth centuries b.c. Moreover, the Medes were not conquered by the Assyrians until the time of Sargon (b.c. 722-705), and even then it was only the more western tribes of them into whose territory the Assyrian king made a raid or two. The Medes of Astyages or Istuvegu were never subject to the Assyrians at all. The whole statement of Herodotos is unhistorical, and merely illustrates the way in which a monarchy was supposed to grow up. ' We find the name of Dainkku as
that of a Minnian chief in the year B.O. 715, and Bit-Daiukku, "the house of Daiokes," lay to the east of Assyria, not far from the district in which Ekbatana was afterwards built Daiukku, a vassal of the Minnian king Ullusun, was carried captive to Hamath by Sargon. • This statement is correct. When Esarhaddon made his campaign against the &Iedcs, he found them divided into a multitude of small states, or rather towns, each under "a city chief." Their political condition was therefore similar to that of Greece. ^ "As j)eople learnt that his decisions were fair;" t6 ibv, "the truth," as in ch. 30, v. 50, vi 37, viL 209, 237.

* Ekbatana or Agbataua, called Agamtanu in the Babylonian text of Kyros and Hagmatdna in the Persian cuneiform, is the modem Hamadan, on the slope of Monnt Elwend, the Orontes of classical geography (Aranzi in Sargon's inscriptions). The description of the palace given by Herodotos shows that it was built in imitation of the great temple erected by Nebuchadnezzar at Borsippa, and now called Birs-i-Nimrud, the seven stages of which were coloured like the walls of the Median I palace (see Judith, i. 2-4). This alone I makes it evident that the city was later I than the date assigned by Herodotos to I Deiokes. But we know from the cuneiI form inscriptions that it must have been
Kastarit or Kyaxares who was the real founder of the Median empire. See Appendix V. Sir H. Rawliiison has tried to show that a second Ekbatana existed at Ganzaka in Atropatene, the ruins of which are now known as Takt-iSuleiman {Jour, of Oeog. Soc. x. 1). The inscription of Kyros, however, indicates that the capital of Astyag^ was the Ekbatana of Media M^or, now Hamadan. ' "Very nearly equal in size to the circuit of Athens." The hearers and readers of Herodotos are here supposed to be acquainted with Athens like the historian himself. The Scholiast on Thuk. ii. 13 makes the circuit of Athens thirteen by sixty stades.

twenty-two of Phraortes would make 105 yeai"s. Dating back from B.c. 610 as the year of the fall of Nineveh, we should reach B.c. 715 as the first year of Deiokes, i.e. the very year in which the Minnian chief Daiukku was carried away prisoner by Sargon. It would therefore seem that the fifty-three years of Herodotos represent the interval between the names of the two "Median" chieftains handed down by tradition. The connection between the Mannai or Minni (in the district between Lakes Van and Urumieh) and the Medes of Ramadan may be explained by the fact that the combined forces which overtlirew Nineveh were composed of Minnians, Medes, and Kimmerians. Hence tradition associated them together. It must not be forgotten that Daiukku was only a subordinate chieftain under UUusun, the Minnian king. His name may be compounded with the Susiauian ukku, "great." ' The name is written Pirru-vartis (perhaps " all-directing ") in the " Proto
medic" (really Susianian) transcript of the Behistun inscription. His reign of twenty-two years seems historical, and we can well believe that he attacked the Assyrians during the decay of their empire. But it is difficult to suppose that the Median empire was founded by him rather than by Kyaxares or Kastarit, since Phraortes, the rival of Darius, assumed the name of Sattarritta (Khshthrita and Khasatrita in the Persian and Assyrian texts) when he attempted to restore the Median kingdom, and called himself the descendant of Vakistarra (Persian, Uvakhsatara ; Ass. Uvakuistar), which has been erroneously identified with the Greek Kyaxares. The latter is really Sattarritta, more correctly written Kastarit in the Assyrian tablets which relate to the last struggle of the Assyrian power. iEskhylos (^Peraoe, 761-64) makes Kyaxares the founder of the empire. ^ The Assyrian sculptures make this statement more than doubtful

• Strabo (i. p. 91) makes Madyes a Kimmerian prince, who drove the Treres out of Asia Minor. The Kimmerians, called Gimirrai in the Assyrian inscriptions, are the Saka of the Persian texts (the Sakae of the Greeks), and first appear in the time of Esarhaddon (b.c. 675), when they threatened the northern frontier of the Assyrian monarchy under their chief Teuspa. Esarhaddon, however, defeated them, and turned them westward into Asia Minor. When Od. xi. 14-19 was composed, they must have already reached the shores of the Euxine, and become known to the Greek merchants and sailors of Ionia. Soon afterwartls they destroyed SinCpe, and then marched into Lydia. Gyges sent two Kimmerian chieftains whom he had captured in battle as a present to Assurbanipal at Nineveh B.c. 665. He was afterwards killed in battle with them. See ch. 15. As they assisted the Medes and Minnians in their final attack on Nineveh, some of them must have settled in or near Media. The Skyths, who drove them from their old homes, seem, from their names, to have been Aryans. The name of Skythopolis, given to Bethshan in Palestine, is supposed to be a memorial of their inroad into Western
Asia, Reference seems to be made to them in the earlier prophecies of Jeremiah. 1 From the mouth of the Mseotis or Sea of Azof to the Phasis (or Rum) is about 270 miles. ' This is a mistake. A large number of tribes and races intervened between Kolkhis and Media (see ch. 110, iiL 94, iv. 37). The Saspeires seem to have inhabited the neighbourhood of Tiflis. Ritter's attempt to identify the name with that of the Iberi is not successful. See iii. 94, note 1. ' i.e. along the shores of the Caspian. The longer route would have been through the Pylae Caucasete. Herodotos, however, seems to be thinking of the route followed by Greek merchants, who first sailed by sea to Phasis and Dioskurias, where they joined the caravan road to the East. * In Homer (/Z. ii. 461) "the Asian mead " is the plain of the Kayster. The conquests of Kroesos seem to have extended the signification of the name, and by the time of Herodotos it had come to mean all Western Asia, Lower Asia being Asia Minor, and Upper Asia the country west of the Tigris. Here Upper Asia can alone be meant.

" Psammetikhos was besieging Ashdod at the time (Herod, ii. 157). • Atargatis or Derketo, the Astart^ of the Phoenicians. According to Xanthos, Askalon was founded by Askalos, the general of the Lydian king Akiamos, and Athenaeos (viiL 37) makes the Lydian Mopsos drown the goddess Derketo in the sacred lake near Askalon. This lake still exists between Mejdel and the sea -shore, and was doubtless the reservoir of the temple of the Asiatic goddess. ' The site of this temple is apparently marked by ruins on a hill facing the west side of San Nikolo in Kythera, between the town and the sea. • "And that visitors to Skythia see among them how afflicted they are whom." Enarees is rendered dwwhpUti F
by Hippokrates (De aere, 22). C!omp. Zend a privative, and nar " man." The French physician Larrey observed a similar disease among the returned Egyptian soldiers. " If Kyaxares be assumed to have reigned at least two years at the time of the Skythian invasion, his capture of Nineveh could not have taken place till at least the thirtieth year of his reign. His war with AJyattes must have been later than this event, as in this he was allied with the Babylonians. Had Nineveh still existed, it would have blocked the road between Babylon and the Halys. ^ HerodotoB again promises "an Assyrian history" in ch. 184. No other author mentions it, and the passage in Aristotle (Hist. An. viiL 18), which saya

that Herodotos introduced an eagle drinking in his account of the capture of Nineveh, has the various reading " Hesiod," while the word veirotriKe looks as if a poet were referred to. Prof. Rawlinson suggests that the "curious notices in John of Malala (ed. Dind. p, 26) concerning the Scythic character of the dress, language, and laws of the Parthians, which are expressly ascribed by him to Herodotos," come from this lost work, as well as the narrative of Eephalion (B.C. 120), who, according to the Synkellos, followed Hellanikos, Ktesias, and Herodotos in his Assyrian history. But John Malalas and Synkellos are late writers, and Herodotos does not seem to have lived long enough after the completion of his history to have had time to carry out his intention. However, the Assyrian history of Ktesias appears to have been composed in order to confute Herodotos. In any case the history of Herodotos would not have been worth very much, if we may judge from his notices of
Assyria and Babylonia in the present book. " We learn from the newly-discovered inscription of Kyros that the overthrow
of Astyages, — Istuvegu in the Assy
rian text, —took place in B.c. 549. li. therefore, Astyages reigned thirty -fivr years his accession would fall B.C. 584, This date, however, cannot well be reconciled with the fact that Kyaxares was the opponent of the Lydians in the battle of the Halys, if that event happened in B.C. 584, or with the most probable date of the fall of Nineveh. ' Nikolaos of Damascus makes Argosto, the mother of Kyros, have the dream. * See Appendix V. Ktesias denied the relationship of Kyros and Astyages, and seems to be borne out by the inscription of Kyros. Astyages has nothing to do with the Zend Aj-Dahaka or " biting snake " of darkness and evil, the Zohak of the Shahnameh, as used to be supposed. The Ass}Tian form of the , name shows it to be of Protoraedic and J non-Aryan origin.

' Instead of ten Persian tribes Xenophon reckons twelve {Kyr. i. 2). The Pasargadae, Maraphii, and Maspii were those on whom "all the other Persians were dependent," i.e. they were the principal tribes. According to Anaximenes (ap. Steph. Byz., 5. v.), Kyros founded Pasargadae, the old capital of the country, called Parsagadse by Quint. Curt. (v. 6, X. 1), but Nik. Dam, represents it as already existing in his father's time. Kyros was buried there (Strab. XV. 1035), and it remained the capital of Persia until the foundation of Persepolis by Darius Hystaspis. It stood on the Kjtos in the south-east of Persia, and consequently cannot be identified ^vith Murghab, which is on the ancient Araxes. The tomb of Kyros at Murghab cannot belong to the founder of the Persian empire on account of its architectural ornamentation, and probably belongs to the brother of Xerxes, the satrap of Egypt, who is called Akhsemenes, "the Akhremenian," by Ktesias. The royal clan of the Akhae
menidse or "friends" traced its descent from Akhsemenes (Hakhamanish), whom the Persian kings in their inscriptions claim as their ancestor. Steph. Byz. reads Penthiadae for Penthialaei, Karmanii for Germanii, and (apparently) Derbikhi for Dropiki. Karmania lay on the eastern frontier of Persis. The Dai were an Elamite tribe, and are called Dehavites in Ezra iv. 9. The Mardi are the Amardi of Strabo (xi. p. 761), who inhabited the range of mountains which separated Persepolis from the Persian Gulf (though they seem to have extended northward as far as the neighbourhood of Susa). The Derbikhi were to the south-west of the Caspian, while the Sagartians were the eastern neighbours of the Medes. The Sagartian opponent of Darius claimed to be the descendant of Vakistarra like the pretender to the Median throne. The nomad tribes were not Aryans at all, and we can account for their being reckoned among the Persians by Hero<lotos only by supposing that his classi

• Nikolaos of Damascus states that five battles were fought between Astyages and Kyros in Persia, Astyages winning the two first. The next two were fought on two successive days just outside Pasargadse. After the fifth, Kyros pursued and captured Astyages, who had
fled with a few friends. Tlio recentlydiscovered inscription of Kyros shows the whole narrative to Ite unhistorical. Nor is the account of Hcrodotos altogether correct. See note on ch. 123. 1 " Because he had written, and therefore the deed was justly his."

; i^u ^, vii. 228. What Herodotos seems to mean is that the Medes ruled Asia "east of the Halys " (notice the use of iv(o) 128 - 28 years, i.e. 100 years. This would place the beginning of their empire in b.c. (649 + 28 =) 677, when the Assyrian empire was still intact. One hundred years, however, is a round and therefore indefinite number, which Herodotos has treated as though it were a definite one, adding to it the twentyeight years of the Skythian inroad. The Median empire could not have lasted more than eighty years at the most, and is probably to be reckoned from the date of the battle of the Halys (B.C 584). • This is the Median revolt which took place in the third year of Darius Hystaspis, as described by him in the Behistun Inscription.
1 The Kyros tablet shows (1) that Kyros was king of £lam, not Persia ; (2) that it was the Median army which revolted against Istuvegu or Astyages. ^ Because Krcesos had begun the war. ' See Appendix V. The "vault heaven " is the Thwasa, '
' god of celestial space," of the Avesta. Sacrifices were not offered to the moon, earthy water, or winds, though vdta "the wind," vayu "the air," the earth, and the water, were "honoured" as "pure" elements. Xerxes scourged the Hellespont (vii. 35), which he would hardly have done had he accounted water divine. Fire was the visible symbol of the supreme god Ahuramazda. The Persians built fire-temples (each called ddUyd gdtiis, "house of the law"), and Dareios, at Behistun, complains that Gomates the Magian destroyed '
' the temples of the gods." Polybios (v. 10) implies that the Persians had temples. Altars were equally used by them.

* Istar is not called Mulidatu or Mulidtu, "the bearer," in any of the Assyrian texts we possess, but such might easily have been her popular title. See ch. 199. ^ Restored from iii. 8. The codices have 'AXirra, probably through the jingle of MijXiTTa. Alilat is the feminine of hilSl, " the shining one," the morning star of Is. 14, 12 (in AssjTian ellu, fem. ellitu). See iii. 8. De Vogiie is ^\Tong in identifying it with the name of the goddess Allath in Palmyrene and Nabathean inscriptions, whose chief seat was Taif in the Hijaz. * This is an error. Mitra or Mithra was the sun-god. The Zoroastrians made him the visible form of Ahuramazda or Ormazd. The Persian Aphrodite was Anahid or Anaitis, whose statue was set up in the temples of the chief cities of the empire by Artaxerxes Mnemdn (b.c. 405), as we learn from an inscription found at Susa, a fragment of Berosos wrongly assigning the deed to Artaxerxes Okhos. ^ This is either a truism or an error. A truism if Herodotos meant that altars were not built and fires kindled just before the actual sacrifice began ; an error if he supposed that there were no altars and fires. Libations were used (see
vii. 54) ; one of the chief ceremonies during a sacrifice was that of the drink of the Haoma (the Vedic Soma). Instru
ments of music — the flute with fifteen
holes, the tambourine, etc., — were also employed in the sacrificial ceremonies. ^ " He also is included.
"
' Here Magos is synonymous with "priest," as in the later period of the Persian monarchy. Up to the time of Darius Hystaspis, however, the Magians were one of the non-Aryan Median tribes (as in ch. 101), who placed the pseudoSmerdis on the throne. The festival which recorded the overthrow of the usurper was called Mayo(povia, not MijSoipovla. Having lost their political importance, however, the Magi acquired a sacerdotal one after the amaIgij.mation of the Medes and Persians, and the gradual infiltration of Persian Zoroastrianism by Median superstitions. See Appendix V. In the Avesta the priest is called
dtharvan or "fire priest." — For the birthday feast cp. Xen. Kyrop. i. 8. There is no allusion to it in the Avesta. ^ A rhythmic prayer, recited in monotone, and addressed first to Ormazd and Mithra, and then to the other holy beings, many examples of which are to be found in the Avesta. Cp. Lucian, KekyomanL xi.

' Still a characteristic of the Persians. The statement that the Persians cooked whole animals in their ovens seems to be parodied by Aristophanes, Akham. 85-7. Cp. Maxim. Tyr., ed. Diibner, Dissert, xxviii. According to Ktfeias (ed. Didot, p. 79) the king was allowed to be drunk only on the day when sacrifices were made to Mithras. 8 Plainly a Greek story. 'Ert- means "yet again." Tacitus ascribes a similar custom to the Germans {Oerm. 22).
* Compare the pretensions of the Celestial Empire, or of the English tourist. Stein regards t^ Xeyofjidvifi in the next clause as a false interpretation of Kari, \&yoif, " in proportion." * " In the time of the Median supremacy the several nations had the following precedence over each other.

' The nation continually made advances in ruling and administering." This means that the empire of Persia had been continually growing, so that new countries were added to its borders, as well as new subjects who took rank after those nearer than themselves to Persia proper itself. Othere understand the sentence of Media and render: "it governed first immediately, then mediately, in a progressive fashion." Stein asks whether we should not read apxlf fuvov for dpxoy ? ' "Adopt foreign customs." * According to ch. 71 the old Persian dress consisted of a leather tunic and trousers. On the monuments the kings wear a long sleeved robe, reaching to the ankles, and fastened round the waist by a girdle. * The "Homeric" KovplSiot, from
G
Kovpoi, belonging to "a free youth," and hence "lawfully wedded," is, it will be noticed, a word of the new Ionic dialect of the age of Herodotos. ^ Persian respect for truth is forcibly illustrated by the Behistun inscription where Dareios calls the Magian usurpation "a lie, " declares that he is favoured by Ormazd because he is not "a liar," and orders his successors to^ destroy every one who is " a liar." Cp. ch. 138. It is difficult to suppose that Kyros was unable to read the inscriptions drawn up for him by the Babylonian scribes J and still more difficult to suppose it of Dareios ; whence we may conclude that Persian education was not quite so illiterate as Herotlotos would imply. Indeed the inscriptions Dareios took such pains to have inscribed by the side of the public road iiuply that a knowledge of letters was fairly widely spread.

names, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, xiii. (1859), pp. 359 sq. ^ According to Zoroastrian belief neither earth nor fire may be polluted by contact with a corpse ; the only way of getting rid of the dead, therefore, is that mentioned in the text. The modem Parsis place the dead body on a round tower, called a " tower of silence," where it is devoured by the viiltures. We mav notice that Herodotos ascribes
this custom to the Magi rather than to the Persians generally, so completely had the Magi become identified with the Zoroastrian priests. ' An exaggeration of the religious duty enjoined on the Zoroastrians of destroying all animals noxious to man. See Appendix V. Ants are ordered to be killed in Yendidad, xvi. 28 ; snakes, lizai-ds, ants, rats, and gnats, in Vend, xiv. 10 aq.

' The. prehistoric Minyans of Orkhomenos in Bceotia were famous for their wealth {II. ix. 381), and seem to have been the rivals of the Akhaeans of Myken». The shafts cut through the rock in the neighbourhood of Kopse ( Topolia) in order to let oflf the water of the Kephissos may have been their work. A prehistoric naval alliance between Orkhomenos, Athens, Epidauros, Hermione, Prasiaj (afterwards Spartan), and Nauplia (aftenvards Argive), which met every year in the island of Kalauria, off Argolis, was preserved in name into historic times. The recent excavations of I>r. Schliemann have shown that the Minyan city occupied only the southern part of the later historical acropolis of Orkhomenos. Prehistoric pottery and stone implements, similar to those found at Mykense, have been brought to light. The "Treasury of Minyas," a gigantic tholas or beehive tomb, like the Treasuries of Mykenffi, only built of woll-cut and well-fitted blocks of white marble, has been shown to have led into a rectangular chamber, the ceiling of which consisted of four huge blocks of green marble, while the walls were lined with slabs of the same material. The ceiling an<l slabs were adorned with sculptures in the form of rosettes, spirals, and "sphinx -tails," resembling the ornamentation of one of the tombstones
discovered at Mykenae, as well as of some of the gold objects found in one of the tombs there. The Minyans are said to have founded Teos (Pans. vii. 3), aud the Phokians Phokaea, while the Abantes helped to found Khios, and the Kadmeians Prien§. Attica was filled with fugitives from all parts (Thuk. i. 2). It is i)robable, however, that the coasts of Asia Minor were occupied by " Ionian " Greeks long before they were reinforced by the fugitives from the Dorians. ^ When a colony was founded, some of the sacred fire, which was always kept alight in the Prytaneion, was taken from the mother city. ^ "Nor call her husband by his name." A Kafir woman is not allowed to name her father-in-law even mentally, or any of her husband's male relations. The Bogo women may not name their husbands (Munzinger, Sitten und Rccht der Bogos, p. 95). Elsewhere, as iir America, persons avoid the use of their own names, while the Tahitians disused all words containing a syllable of the name of the reigning sovereign. It is clear, therefore, that the custom originated in a fear lest by mentioning a name the attention of the evil spirits might be attracted to the person to whom it belonged. In Miletos its origin wasforgotten.

' The Apaturia was the annual meet* ing of the phratries, when the children Iwrn during the two or three preceding years were enrolled as citizens.

On the first (Sopir/o) the members of each phratry dined together ; on the second {dvd^l>v<Tis) sacrifices were offered to Zeus Phratrios ; and on the third (KovptCtrii) the children's names were registered. » In the time of Thukydides (iil 104) this feast was in great measure 8U|)erseded by the Ephesia.

' In the inscription on the tomb of Darius Hystaspis at Nakhsh-i-Rusta'm, the Sakse are divided into the Saka Humavarga and the Saka Tigrakhuda. In vii. 64 Herodotos calls them Amyrgian (= Humavarga) Skythians. They denoted the nomad tribes on the eastern borders of Baktria, some of whom may have been of Aryan origin. They lived north of the Jaxartes according to Arrian (iii. 8 ; iv. 1, 4 ; and see Strab. xi. p. 748), where Herodotos places the Mas
In the Babylonian transcripts of the Persian inscriptions the Saka are rendered Zimmirrai or Kurds, and there were Sakse in Armenia adjoining the Medes and Kadusians (Strab. vi. pp. 745, 767, etc. ; Pliny, N. H. xi. 10 ; Ptol. V. 13). Tlie Skythians who overthrew the Greek kingdom in Baktria are also called Sakae. According to Ktesias the conquest of the Sakae and Baktrians preceded the capture of Sanies. ^^ From the old proverb ascribed to the Epic poet Stasinos (Arist.

by Sylla. The Delphic oracle largely promoted colonisation at this time, urging the foundation of Greek colonies in the western part of the Mediterranean (as, for example, at Kyrene), which had hitherto been in the liands of the Phajnicians. The pilgrims and merchants from these trading settlements brought in a handsome revenue to the oracle. Hence AjwUo was the patron god of new colonies. ' The Tyrsenians mean the Etruscans. Traces of their trade have been met with as far north as Belgium ; their colonisation southward extended to Cami>ania, and their fleets contended with the Carthaginians for the command of the north-western basin of tlie Mediterranean. The Latin Carthago is the Greek Karklu'dOn, both attem})t8 to reproduce tlie Pluenician Kiryath-Khadashath or "New Town." The older Latin form
of the name was Carthada (Soliu. Polyh. xxviL 10 ; Isid. Hisp. Et. xv. 1, 30). The '
' Old Town " was eitlier Utica or, less probably, the mother-city Tyre. * i.e. a victory which protluces mon harm tliau profit. The phrase is de rived from the combat between Polynikes and Eteokles by Plutarch, from the conquest of the Seven Heroes by the Thebans, which only led to the return of the Epigoni, by Eustathios (ad Hma. n. iv. 407). ' The lacuna has been conjecturally supplied thus : SifKaxov, rwv Si T!vp<rrivCov oi 'A7i'XXotot. Agylla was said to liave been founded by the " Pelasgian.s." The name of its jwrt, Pyrgi, and its consultation of the Delphic oracle, go far to sliow that it was not originally Etruscan, and that the later name Caere (now Cervctri) indicates its passing under Etruscan rule.

'^ Mahaflfy {Hist, of CI. Greek Lit. i. J). 178, edit, i.), comparing the verbally similar statement of Diog. Laertius, i. 5, concludes that in Theognis 757-68 we have an actual fragment of Bias preserved, describing the blessings of the proposed Ionic settlement in Sardinia. ' Com p. V. 106, vi. 2, whence it appears that Herodotos thought Sardinia the largest island in the world. But even Sicily seems to be larger. ' The Phcenician ancestry of Thales, the founder of Greek science, and one of the seven wise men of Hellas, is significant. See note 1 on the first ch. of this book. His j)hilosophic system, which derived the world from water, was of Babylonian origin : in Phoenician cosmogony M6t was the watery chaos from which the universe has been evolved. Comp. Gen. L 2. The astronomy of Thales equally came from Chaldea, where eclipses had been regularly predicted centuries before. * The statements of Herodotos which follow have a si)ecial importance, as he was a native of Halikarnassos, and so better acquainted with the Karians than most other Greek writers. Tlie Kaunians lived between Karia and Lykia, the
ruins of their capital Kaunos being upon a small stream, the Koigez, and including Cyclopean walls. We learn from Thukyd. (i. 8) that Karian tombs existed in Delos. Kohler has suggested that the remains found at Spata and Menidi in Attika may be those of Karian settlers ; but of this there is neither artistic nor arcliitectural proof. Mysos, Lydos, and Kar were brothers (cp. vii. 74, where the Mysians are called Lydiau colonists) ; but while the remains of the Lydian language preserved in Gret'k glosses are Aryan, the remains of tli' Karian tongue hardly seem to be s^ Thirteen Karian inscriptions, in nn alphabet only partially decipheretl as yet, have been discovered, all except one (from the ruins of Krya, on the Gulf of Skopea), in Egypt, where they were inscribeil by the Karian mercenarii'> of Psammetiklios and his successors. A long list of Karian names is contained in the inscription found in the ca-stle of Budrum (Newton, Essays on Art and Archccology, pp. 427, etc.) The semimythical Leleges are as ubiquitous as the Pelasgians. They turn up in Lykia and Akamania (Aristot.), Karia (Strab.), Mount Ida (Nymph.), Samos (Menodot.]^

Khios (Pherykyd.), Thessaly (Steph. IJyz. s.v. 'A/ivpos), Megara (Paus.), IJoeotia, Lokris, and ^tolia (Aristot.), and Lakonia (Paus.) They api)ear along ^\'ith the mythical Kauk6nes and " divine Pelasgians" in H. x. 429, and between the Karians and Lykians. See also II. XX. 96, and xxi. 86. The KaukSnes appear in II. xx. 329, and Od. iii. 366 (cp. Herod, i. 147, iv. 148). Strabo makes them one of the earliest i-aces of Greece (vii. 465), where they gave their name to the Kaukdn in the N.W. angle of the Peloponnesos, and to the Kaukonitae 'on the Parthenios. The Lykians called themselves Tramele, the name Lykia being derived from the Greek settlers on the coast, who called the country to the east, where the sun rose from behind the mountains, " the land of light ' or AvKla. Hence the legend that the Ionian Lykos gave his name to the country. The Lykian inscriptions have been partly deciphered by the help of a few bilingual (Greek and Lykian) texts ; the language of them, though inflectional, is not Aryan, in spite of all the attempts that have been made to show the contrary. * The name Minds may have the same origin as Minyas, but it has nothing to do, as has been sometimes s<'ud, either Mrith the Aryan word man or with the Egyptian Menes. The "thalassokiatia " of Minds denotes the period when the Phoenicians were colonising
H
and ruling in the JEgean ; and the connection of Dajdalos, the cunning craftsman, and of the Minotaur or bull, with MinOs further indicates his Semitic character. Perhaps his name comes from the Semitic root mdndh, "to api>ortion " or " measure " (whence /wa). It is difficult not to associate the name with that of the Minyans of Orkhomenos, more esj>ecially when we remember that the Phoenician legend of Athamas or Taramuz, the sun - god, is connected with them, Athamas being called the son of ilinyas. Herodotos does not seem to know of the later belief, shared by Thukyd., that Minds was a Greek. Hence he asserts that the thalassokratia of Minds and of the Karians must have been at the same time. In the Iliad Sarpeddn is a descendant of the Greek Bellerophdn ; and Minds, who is two generations older, has only one brother, Rhadamanthys (//. xiv. 322). The earlier legend, which made Minds and Sari»eddu Phoenicians, was found in Hesiod (according to the Scholiast on Eurip. Blus. 28). Herodotos does not seem to know the version of the myth given in the Iliad. 1 The Balawat bronzes (b.c. 840) represent the soldiers of Ararat (Van) with crested helmets and small round shields held by a handle in the middle. Their short tunics and shoes with turned

up toes are identical with those of the Hittites, and there are many rea.sous for

' The plain of the Kayster is called "the Asian meatl" in H. ii. 461 (see th. 104, note 4), and it would seem tliat it was still known as "Asia" in the time of Herodotos. The name was afterwards extended to denote the Roman province of Asia (in Asia Minor), and Justin firet si)eaks of " Asia Major " as denoting the continent in contradistinction to " Asia Minor." In the Augustan age Milyas was the plateau, 4000 feet above the sea, the capital of which is now Almali. It was bounded by Tauros on the north, and Klimax and Solyma on the east. Strabo makes the Milyans as well as the Kabalians Solymi (xiii. p. 904 ; xiv. p. 952), who once extended along the Tauros from Lykia to Pisidia. According to Pliny (iV. H. v. 27) and Steph. Byz., the Pisidians were Solymi. Khoerilos (a j)oet of the fourth century B.C.) stated that the Solymi formed part of the army of Xerxes, inhabited the shores of a lake (supposed to be Egridir by Leake), and s^wke the Phoenician language. The last assertion, however, was probably due to the fancied similarity of the word Solymi to Hierosolyma, the Greek form of Jerusalem. At any rate Josephus {Cont. Ap.. L) takes it for granted tliat Khoerilos meant the inhabitants of Judaea, though he describes the Solymi as having "sooty
heads," all shorn except a single tuft of hair. As Klimax and Solyma were different mountains, there is little reason for ex2)laining the latter name by the Hebrew mdldm, *
' a ladder. " The Solymi are mentioned, B. vi. 184, sq. ; Od. v. 283. •* The Tramele of the native inscriptions : Tremileis in Steph. Byz. " Herodotos was mistaken here, as it is the rule among primitive tribes to trace the descent through the mother and not through the father. "Even among hunting tribes," says Sir J. Lubbock, "though men were unable to maintain so many wives, still, as changes are of frequent occurrence, the tie between a mother and child is much stronger than that which binds a child to its father." On the western poast of Africa a man's lieirs are his sister's children, as also in Central Africa (Caillie's TraveU, i. p. 153), on the Congo, among the Berbers, and in Madagascar. Descent was reckoned from tlie mother among the Lokriaus, according to Polybios, and is still among the Kasias, Kochs, and Nairs of India. Property is transmitted through females alone on the Malabar coast (Sir W. Elliot, Trails. Ethn. Soc 1869, p. 119). A chiefs successor is his sister's sou among the Battas of Siunatra and other Malav

' That is 56 miles, enclosing an area of about 200 square miles, which is absurd. Ktesias, who adds a third wall, contrary to the evidence of the monuments, makes the circuit 360 stades (42 miles), Strabo (xvi. 1, 5) 386 stades, Qu. Curtius (vi. 1, 26) 368 stades, and Kleitarkhos (aj). Diod. Sic. ii. 7) 365 stades. Nebuchadrezzar himself states that " the citadel of Babylon" occupied a space of 4000 square cubits. • The height would then be about 385 feet (the width being 85 feet) ; Ktesias made the height 200 cubits, Strabo only 50 cubits. In the time of Xenophon, we may remember, the ruined wall of Nineveh was 150 feet high {Anah. iii. 4, 10). ' It is im^K>ssible to determine the exact equivalents of these two measures,
but we may reckon the ammat or cubit at about twenty inches. ^ Layers of reeds have been found bedding the courses of crude brick among the ruins of Babylonia, and so binding them together. Asphalt (iddu in Semitic, ebu in Accadian) was plentiful in the Babylonian plain, especially at Is, now Hit, which probably took its name from the word iddu. As, however, hid was the Accadian term for '* a river," it is possible that the town was named after the river on which it stood. It is called Aeiiwlis by Isid. Khar., Idikara by Ptolemy. " The Euphrates was called by the Accadians the Pur-rat or " winding water," whence the A.ssyrian Purratu ; Heb., P'rath ; Old Persian, Ufratu ; and Greek, Euphrates (with a play on e5 in reference to the " good " waters of the river).

^ Babylon, now represented by Hillah, is the Hebrew Babel, the Assyro-Babylonian Bab-ili, "Gate of the god," the Semitic translation of the original Accadian name Ka-dimirra. It was also known in Accadian times as E, "the liollow," and Din-Tir, "the city of the tree (of life)." It first became the capital of tlie country under Khammuragas, tlie leader of the Cassite dynasty. ^ "Winding" with the river. ' "Three and four stories high." This shows that the city was more densely built than is usually supposed, and that the system of building in stories which prevailed in Rome liad already been known in Babylon. * The salkhu or outer wall is called Niniitti-Bilu ("foundation of Bel") in the inscriptions, the inner wall being called Imgur-Bilu (" habitation of Bel"). Both were built by Nebuchadrezzar, ' Now represented by the Kasr or "Palace" mound, which Herodotos incorrectly transfers to the western l)ank
of the river. According to Diodoros (ii. 8, 4) it was surrounded by three walls, the outermost being sixty stades (seven miles) in circuit. The inner walls were adorned mth jminted bricks, and two of its gates, opened and shut by machines, were of brass. It was begun by Nabojwlassar, and finished in fifteen days by Nebucliadrezzar, who calls it "The guardhouse of mankind." It overlooked the Ai - ipur - sabu, or great reservoir of Babylon, and stretched from this to the Euphrates on the one side, and from the Imgur-Bel to the Libil or eastern canal on the other. Within it were the hanging gardens, watered by means of a screw. An earlier ruined palace is represented by the Amram mound, the smaller ^lalace of Neriglis-sar standing in the western jMirt of the city. " Now represented by the BabU or Mujellibeh mound. Bel (Bilu in the inscriptions) is the same word as the Pha-niko-Hebrew Baal, " loi-d," and was

* The iucense altar before the ark in the Jewish tabernacle was similarly overlaid with gold (Ex. xx;xvii. 26). In front of the ark was also a table overlaid with gold (Ex. xxxvii. 11). ^ According to Arrian (vii. 17) Xerxes " destroyed " the temple after his return from Greece. In this case Herodotos could not have seen the temple himself, but must have derived his information about it from some earlier author, whom he quotes without acknowledgment. This is supported by his reference (ch. 182) to Egyptian Thebes, which, as will be seen, he also never visited. - See ch. 106, note 1. ' We learn from ch. 188 that Nit6kris, the later queen, was the mother of Nabonidos ; consequently the Semiramis of Herotlotos will have flourished about 150 years before, if we assume thirty years for a generation, as elsewhere. This brings us to B.C. 700, when Babylonia was oven-un by Assyrians and Elamites, and a prey to internal discords. No great public works could have been executed at this time, and a few yeare later (B.C. 695) Babylon was razed to the ground by Sennacherib. Semiramis, moreover, was the name, not of a human
queen, but of the goddess Istar, whose legend was rationalised by the Persian historians and their Greek followers. 'Sammuramat, the queen of Rimmonnirari (b.c. 810-792), was an Assyrian princess, and lived a century earlier tlian the Semiramis of Herodotos. Besides, her name may not be identical with that of Semiramis, and the reading of it is not quite certain. Perhaps Scaliger was right in proposing to read "fifty" instead of "five," which would bring us to B.C. 2050, the period at which the Semiramis of Greek romance was popularl}' supposed to have flourished (Synkellos B.C. 2177, Ensebios B.c. 1984, both on the authority of Ktesias). On the other hand, Polyhistor endeavours to combine the dynasties of Berosos with the Greek legend of Semiramis by introducing her as a queen of the Assyrians before the rise of the Assyrian dynasty in Babylonia B.C. 1272, and Hellanikos makes her a contemiwrary of the Trojan War b.c. 1229. She belongs, however, not to Assyrian history, but to Assyrian mythology. Vitringa's reading "fifteen" is supported by Mahafiy's corrections in L 72 and ii. 34 ; but 450 years would bring us to Rc.

1000, a date to which Semiramis is assigned by no classical author. * NitSkris is an Egyjitian name (Neitakrit). Nabonidos did not belong to the royal family, and his mother might easily have been an Egyptian. She must be the queen-mother who figures so prominently in the tablet of Kyros, which records the reign and fall of Nabonidos. From this we learn that while the king himself was wasting his time in idleness at Babylon, his mother was encouraging the army by her presence in the camp near Sii>para, where she died on the 5th of Nisan B.c. 547. It is therefore very prol)able that the works of defence which Nabonidos claimed to have made against the attack of the Persians were really due to the energy of the queen-mother, as Herodotos states.
' Arderikka is not yet identified, and probably is imaginary. Sir H. Rawlinson says :
'
' No such cuttings as thosf here described by Herodotus can ever have existed." In vi. 119 Herodotos places Arderikka near Susa. ' If we venture to throw aside the authority of all the MSS., with Schweighaiiser, and omit is before rdv Ev<pfr/ini», the meaning of the passage would be simple enough : "Those who would now go from our (Mediterranean) sea to Babylonia, sail down the Euphrates." Retaining 4s, however, we must translate : "Those who would now go from this .sea into Babylonia, sailing down it into the Euphrates." In this case the sea would be the Persian Gulf, and the writer would not be Herodotos, but some unknown one whom he is quoting.

The few stones brought from Babylonia are either gems or boundary stones, the smallest pebble being of high value. It was no doubt the rarity and conacquent preciousness of stone which caused the Baby

with the Diyalah, but tlie legend ])robably rather has in ^^ew the Gingir, which is divided into a number of small streams at Mendalli. ^ The Araxes also is said to rise in the Matienian mountains, ch. 202. SamasRimmon (b.c. 821) defeated Khanatsiruca, king of the Matai, in the mountains to the north-east of Assyria, and sacked his capital Sagbita, and Lake Urumiyeh was known as Lake Matiana to classical geography. The j)lace of the Matai seems to be taken by the Medes (Madai) in later inscriptions. See iii. 94, note 9. " Otherwise unknown. 8 Herodotos must mean that the Gyndes joins the Tigris near Opis (Uiie in the inscriptions), after which the Tigris flows southward. But Xenophon (Anab. iL iv. 13-25) shows that Opis lay near the junction of the Physkos, not the Gyndes, with the Tigris, many miles to the north of the Diyalah.
' "By stretching roi^es he marked out 180 straight trenches." ^ Sir H. Rawlinson rightly divined that the whole story was "a fable," a.s is now proved by the tablet inscription of Kyros, from which we learn that the Persians marelied upon Babylonia from the south, not from the north. He believes it embodies "some popular tradition with regard to the great hydraulic works on the Diydlali below the Hamaran hills, where the river has l)een dammed across to raise the level of the water, and a jierfect network of canals has been opened out from it on either side." It is not surprising, therefore, that the geography of Herodotos should be as confused as his narrative, or that the channels should be just 360, the number of days in the old Babylonian year, perhajis suggested by the fact that the horse was sacretl to the sun. We may well doubt whether such a stream as hia Gyndes really existed at all.

* Herodotos is ignorant of the numerous captures of the city by the Assyrians, l>eginning with that of Tiglath - Adar and ending with that of Sennacherib. Probably he mshed to contrast this capture of Babylon with that by Darius Hystaspis (see iii. 159), though the legend lie borrowed may have intended nothing more than a reference to the two captures in the reign of Darius. See iii. 159. ' " Satrap " is the old Persian khshaIrapd for khshatrapdvxin, '
' defender of the empire." ' Hence the modem Egyptian ardeb (nearly 5 bushels). The artabe would have contained 1 } busliels.
' See Mr. W. Houghton's Papers on the Mammalia of the Assyrian Ijiscriptions, in the Trans. Soc. Bibl. Archaol. V. (1877). * A good deal of rain falls in Assyria, In Babylonia it is rare during the summer, though there is plenty in the winter and spring. ' The Egyptian shaduf. An early Accadian collection of agricultural proverbs says : "The irrigation - machine he puts together ; the bucket he hangs, and the water he will draw up." Irrigation naturally playetl a large part in the economy of Babylonia.

Herodotos does not seem to p. 1058). But its actual prevalence may esteem womankind more highly than be doubted. At any rate no reference did Euripides.

' The Massagetse were regarded as Skyths, like the Thyssagetae (iv. 22) and the Getse. Herodotos states that they lived on the western hank of the A raxes, opposite the Issedones. The Arimaspeia of Aristeas of Prokonnesos (iv. 13) seems to have first spread among the Greeks a knowledge of the Issedones and of their eastern neighbours the Baldheaded Men, the Arimaspi or Oneeyed Men, and the gold-guarding Griffins (see iiL 116, and iv. 27). Tlie Greek colonists of the Euxine, liowever, must have previously become acquainted with these legends through the caravan-trade from Eastern Asia. A Chinese book on mjrthical zoologj' and anthroiwlogy, which claims to have been written B.o. 1100, and is at least as old as the time of Confucius, has pictures of the Oneeyed men (or Kyklopes), described as living beyond the deserts to the west, and of their neighbours the Pigmies. The latter (already known to the II. iii.
6) are said to walk arm in arm lest they should be carried away by the birds. The legend of the griffins originated in the discovery of mammoths and fossil rhinoceroses, whose honis are still supposed to be bird's olaws by the Siberians, on the gold - bearing banks of the Siberian rivers (see H. Howorth on the "Mammoth," Geol. Mag., Sept. 1880). For the various forms assumed by the legend of the Kyklops see Sayce, Introduction to the Sciciux of Language, ii. pp. 263 sq. " This sounds like a confused account of the use of tobacco, which, however, could not have made its way from America to Asia at this time. ' Herodotos has mixed two rivers together, the Aras or Araxes, which rise* near ErzerAm, and flows eastward into the Caspian, and a large river on the eastern side of the Caspian (according to ch. 202), which was probably the Jaxartes.

^ The circumnavigation of Africa by the ships of the Egj^tian king Necho (iv. 42) had shown that the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean were one and the same sea. * The Kaukasos has been always famous as the last refuge of numerous diflferent races and languages which have become extinct elsewhere. Mithridates knew twenty - four languages spoken by his subjects, and Pliny {N. H. vi. 5) states that in Colchis there were more than 300 tribes speaking different languages, and requiring 130 interpreters for intercourse with the Romans ; while Strabo (x. p. 498) asserts that seventy distinct tribes gathered together into Dioskurias. The Greek caravans along the Volga employed seven interpreters (Herod, iv. 24). The known languages of the Kaukasos resolve themselves into five groups, which have no connection either with one
another or with any other tongues : —(1)
Lesghic, (2) Ude, (3) Circassian, (4) Thushian, and (5) Kartwelian or Alarodian. Under Lesghic are comprised Avar, Audi, Dido, Kasikumuk, and Akush ; under Circassian, Abkhas or Absne, Kurinian, Cherkess, Bzyb, and Adige ; under Thushian, Thush, Chetchenz, Arshte, and Ingush or Lamur
;
and under Kartwelian, Georgian, Lazian, Mingrelian, Suanian, and the extinct language of the cuneiform inscriptions of Van. ^ This is not very probable. Almost the only well-authenticated case of the kind is that of the Arctic highlanders, a degraded branch of the Eskimaux, first visited by Ross and Parry. For the Andamanners, Bushmen, Nairs, and Techurs of Oude, Califomians, and natives of Queen Charlotte Island, see Lubbock's Origin of Civilisation, Third Edit., pp. 82, 83. Strabo asserts the same of the Garamantes. See also Herod, iv. 180, and i. 216.

" " They fight both on horseback and on foot" . . . " usually emplojang the sagaris," which was also used by the the Persians, Mossynoeki, and Amazons, and according to Hesykh. was singleedged (see Herod, iv. 70). Sir H. Rawlinson suggests that it is the modem Persian khanjar. We may compare the short dagger worn by the warriors of the Hittite sculptures. • Gold abounds in the Ural and Altai mountains, and a large proiwrtion of the names of Tatar heroes are compounded vdi\\ the word alien, "gold." As the tumuli of the steppes show, the Skythians of Herodotos were still in the bronze age. ' See ch. 203, note 1, and iii. 101. ' Here Herodotos distinctly states that the Massagetse are not Skyths. By
the latter he means the nomade and half-settled tribes which spread over the southern part of Bussia, extending on the one side to Thrace, and on the other into the stepi)es of Tatary. Many of these were no doubt Turkish - Tatars ; others perhaps belonged to the Mongol or other races whose relics are now preserved in the Kaukasos ; but a lai*ge part seem to have been Sarmatians or Aryan Slavs. Among the latter are included the Budini, Neuri, etc., of Herodotos (bk. iv.) The Massagetee, like tin Sakffl with whom they are associated, were probably connected with the modem Kirghizes. At all events, they seem to have been Tatars like the Sakie who founded the Turanian kingdom of Baktriana between B.C. 165 and 150. The " Greeks" mean perhaps Hekatseoa.

that horses were sacrificed to the sun in Armenia. The noblest sacrifice that could be ofiered by the Aryans of the Rig-Veda was the horse.

^ Three. Babylonian contract - tablets exist in the British Museum, bearing
the dates—(1) "the first year of Eam
bys&, king of Babylon, his father Kyros being king of the world;" (2) "the eighth year of Kambyses, king of Babylon and the world ; " (3) '
' the eleventh year of Kambyses, king of Babylon." (See Pinches in the Trans. Soc. Bib. ArchcEol. vi. 2.) This supports Africanus in making the length of the reign of Kambyses eleven years as against the eight years of Ptolemy's Canon and the seven years and five months of Herodotos. We must, therefore, suppose that Kyros made his son Kambyses king of Babylon, reserving to himself the imperial title, in b.o. 530, since we 2>osses8 tablets dated from the accession year (B.C. 539) to the ninth year of Kyros as king of Babylon, and that Kamby^s was officially considered to be king up to the accession of Darius, after the overthrow of the pretender Nebuchadrezzar III. in B.C. 519. It is very possible
that, like Nero, he was jK)pularly supposed to be still living. Manetho, according to Africanus, made Kambyses reign six years in Egypt, which would make his invasion of the country take place in B.c. 528 (B.C. 522 being the eighth year of Kambys^ as king of Babylon, and the date of the Magian usurpation). This was probably the year of the death of Kyros. On the other hand, Egj^itian scholars agree with Eusebios and Diodoros in placing the invasion in B.C. 525. But this depends on assigning b.c. 664 as the date of the accession of Psammetikhos I. According to Clem. Alex. {Sir. i. p. 895), Kambyses reigned nineteen years
;
Ktesias says eighteen. ~ " The Egyptians considered themselves to have been created by tin supreme demiurge Khnum ; while the races of Asia and Europe were only the formations of the goddess Sekhet, and the negroes of the younger god Horus.

" Egyptian Men-nofer, "good place," corrupted into Ma-nuf, Copt. Menf and Memfi (Moph and Noph in the Old Testament). The most ancient name of the city was "the white wall," the special title of the citadel. Ptah and his son Imhotep (the Egyptian Asklepios), along with hisl "great lover," Sekhet, were worshipped there. It was built by Menes, and was the capital of the Old Empire. From the worship of Ptah Memphis received the sacred name of Ha-ka-Ptah, "city of the worship of Ptah."

' The Egyptian name of Thebes was Us, the sacred quarter on the east bank of the Nile being T-Ape, "the head," whence the Greek 0^/3ai. It is called Nia in the Assyrian inscriptions, No
Ammon or "No of Amun" in the Old
Testament, from the popular Egyptian name Nu, "the city," or Nu-a, "the great city," also Nu-Amon. Amun was its patron deity. It first appears in history as the capital of the Middle Empire. I have bracketed the words is 6iJ/3ai T6 Kal for the reason given in ch. 29, note 7.

a cover for ignorance. So chh. 45, 46, 47, 48, 61, 62, 65, 81, 132, 170, 171. As Wiedemann points out, "there is no jiart of the work of Herodotos [on Egypt] which betrays so much ignorance as that which deals with religion." He is not therefore likely to have known an}i;hing of the mysteries of the Egyptian faith, more especially as his only informants were half-caste dragomen. In ch. 86 he says he will not divulge the name of the deity who was embalmed, and yet every child in Egypt knew that it was Osiris, and the name appears on myriads of sepulchral monuments. " It is clear," saj's Wiedemann, "that Herodotos had not understood the name, and tried to conceal his ignorance under an affectation of secret knowledge." ^ Herodotos shows that he does not understand the Egyptian method of in tercalation, which must have been by th< intercalation of the quarter days. IK' equally forgets the claims of the Babylonians to early knowledge of astronomy

and the calendar. The Sothic cycle of the Egyptians proves that they had knoAVTi from an early date that 1460 Sothic years were equal to 1461 vague ones. In reckoning the dates of a king's reign, however, they used the year of 360 days, and reckoned the months of his reign, not from his accession, but from the beginning of the year in which he ascended the throne. The Babylonians in later times distinguished between the year of a king's accession and the first year of his reign. The Zodiac was a Babylonian discovery, not, as Herodotos imagines, an Egyptian one. 2 The ciceroni employed by Herodotos probably knew more about Greek than about Egyptian mytliology, and, as their employers were Greeks, took care to tell them what would interest or flatter them. Hence the astounding statemet^t of the text. * Menes was not the first "human" king of Egypt (after the demigods and gods), but the first monarch of all Egypt. Herodotos probably wrote Jd.i}va (as in three MSS.), which the copyists have assimilated to the name of Minds. * This, of course, is a fiction, based
on wrong conclusions drawn from^ the appearance of nature. Pottery has been found at Memphis by Hekekyan Bey thirty-nine feet below the colossal statue of Ramses II., which would have been deposited there 11,646 years B.c. if the rate of increase of Nile mud had been the same before the age of Ramses that it has been since. Memphis itself is far to the north of Lake Mceris, and the desert which formed the necropolis of Memphis had been dry and bare for countless ages before the time of Menes. Bubastis, Pelusium, and other towns of the Delta, existed in the days of the Old Empire, and Busiris, near the coast, was supposed to be the burial-place of Osiris. ' This is taken without acknowledgment from Hekatteos (see Arrian. v. 6). ^No doubt the Delta was originally formed by the Nile ; but as marine deposits are not found at a depth of forty feet, it must have existed for thousands of years before the foundation of the Egyptian monarchy. The laud is sinking along the north coast of Egypt, so that the Delta is really becoming smaller instead oflarger. See also ch. 10.

* Plinthine was on the Mareotic Lake. The Serbonian Lake still exists, as Mr. 6. Chester's explorations have shown, divided from the sea by a narrow strip of sand, and extending along the coast of the Mediterranean eastwards of the Delta. It is a sea-water, not a freshwater, lake. Mount Kasios stretches into the sea in the form of a promontory, and took its name from the Phoenician temple of Baal-Katsiu ("Baal of the promontory "), which stood upon it. Like Mount Kasios on the Syrian coast, it was also known as the mountain of Baal Tsephon, "Baal of the North" {Bahli- Tsapuna in the Assyrian texts). The name of the god Katsiu is found in Nabathean inscriptions {e.g. de Vogiie, Syrie centrale, 4), and Zei5j Kdo-io? on bronze coins of Seleukia in Pieria, where the god is represented by a conical stone. The name is not connected with that of Kais, a pre-Islamitic deity of the Arabs, or Kof^, an Idamseau
divinity (Joseph. Antiq. xv. 7, 9), as has been sometimes supposed. The Egj'ptian kliennaJi or skhoenos varied from thirty to forty stadia (Plin. N. H. v. 10, xii. 14), whereas Herodotos here makes it sixty stadia. He thus makes the length of the coast 3600 stadia or more than 400 miles, while the real length is hardly more than 300 miles. 7 "Flat, and without spring water." * The roads of Attica were due to Peisistratos, who unified and centralised the country, making them all meet in the market-place of Athens. • Olympia was orginally the suburban temple of Pisa, which it supplanted and destroyed with the help of Sjiarta. According to Pausauias, Pisa was razed to the ground in b.o. 572. Its site is no longer traceable. The road must have continued to bear the name of the "Pisan" rather than "Olympian" up to the age of Herodotus.

^ These quarries are at Ma'sara and Turra, between Cairo and Helwan, in the Mokattum range of hills, the northem continuation of the "Arabian mountains " on the eastern bank of the Nile. Turra is the Ta-rofu, later Taroue, "region of the wide rock gateway," of the monuments, the Troja of Strabo and Diodoros, who 8up})ose that the quarries were first worked by the captive Trojans of Alenelaos. They were worked from the tim# of the fourth dynasty downwards. ' lilgypt, it must be remembered, is only the strip of cultivated land on

either side of the Nile. The MSS. omit Kal Sixa (inserted by Dietsch), which are required for the real distance as well as for the calculations of Herodotos himself elsewhere (chh. 9 and 29). * In reality it is not more than 666 miles. On the other hand, Herodotos has stated that there are 1500 stades from the sea to Heliopolia, and 4860 stades from Heliopolis to Thebeji, making altogether 6360 stadea ! * Really only 124 miles.

' Juts out beyond the neighbouring shores." The coast-line of the Delta projects a little beyond that of the desert on either side. ^ Herodotos refers to the fossils of the tertiary nummulite limestone. In many places the desert is covered with a solid g3rp8eous and saline crust. * Herodotos could not have travelled to the south of Memphis with observant eyes. Sand-drifts are common, especially on the western side of the Nile. * Moeris is one of the imaginary Egyptian kings of Herodotos. In Egyptian tneri signified "a lake," and was therefore applied to the great artificial reservoir of the Fay{lm,whose proper name was hun-t, "the discharge lake." It seems to have been constructed by Amen-em-hat III. of the twelfth dynasty
(about B.C. 2900). He, therefore, will be the Moeris of Herodotos, as the latter is stated in ch. 101 to have made the lake ; but instead of being only 900 years older than Herodotos, he was between two and three thousand. « 23 cubits 2 inches (about 41 feet 2 inches) are now required. In the time of Amen - em - hat III. the river rose 27 feet 3 inches higher than it does today at Semneh (thirty miles south of the Second Cataract). Between his date and that of the eighteenth dynasty the First Cataract was formed, reducing Nubia to a desert, and no doubt causing the rise in the height of the inundation in Egypt mentioned in the text. ' "If the country goes on increasing in height as it has done, and grows equally in amount."

by the ruins of Tel el-Herr and Geziret el-Farama. KerkasOros is called Kerkesoura by Strabo. The name (Kerkosiris) seems to mean " split of Osiris," the Nile splitting at its site into the KanQpic and Pelusiac forks. * This is a mistake. The Nile is called iEgyptos in Homer {Od. iv. 477, xiv. 257), the latest conjecture about the latter word being that it is Ha-kaptah, the ancient name of Memphis (see ch. 2, note 6). The Egyptians themselves called their country Khem, the
Hebrew Ham, "black," from the black mud deposited by the Nile, During the New Empire the Delta was known as Keft-ur or "Greater Phoenicia" (the Caphtor of the Old Testament), from the number of Phoenicians settled tliere. Aristotle says that Egypt was once called Thebes, thus still further misunderstanding the mistake of Herodotos. We must note that in what follows Herodotos distinguishes between the views of the Greek and of the Ionian geographers.

* See cli. 19, note 1. ' i.e. Neith. The office held by the sacred scribe was a very high one, and he seems the only priest of rank with whom Herodotos came into contact, the other " priests " mentioned by him being merely the custodians of the temples, who knew a little Greek, and showed them to travellers like the custodians and guides of our own churches. As the sacred scribe was probably unacquainted with Greek, conversation must have been carried on through the dragoman, and Wiedemann conjectures that the story put into the priest's mouth was due to a misunderstanding of the interpreter's meaning. The stele of Redesieh states that the water of a spring in the desert bubbled up like that from the bottom of the Kerti of Elephantine, where reference is made to " two fountains" or kerti. Evorj' Egyptian
knew that the sources of the Nile were not near Syene (Assuan) by hundreds of miles, and that Elephantine (Egyptian Abu, "the elephant-island") was not a city, but an island, between which and Syene there is only the water of the Nile. But Herodotos seems to have divined that the sacred scribe was only answering the inquisitive stranger according to his folly. KrGphi and Mdphi may be a reminiscence of the two peaks which overhang the Third Cataract, and can be seen from the rock of Abusir at the Second Cataract. The jingle of names is one in which Orientals, more esjiecially Arabs, delight, e.g. Abil and Kabil for Cain and Abel. • This, of course, was pure invention. The sacred scribe must have said something about the First Cataract, which Herodotos misunderstood.

7 The words ain-hirTi^s—iriXtoj are omitted by one MS., and for the sake of Herodotos it may be hoi)ed that they were not in his original text, as they cannot be true. Had he really visited Elephantine he would have known that it was an island, not a town, nor would he have cared to mention the story of the sacred priest of Sais. A traveller, moreover, who has dwelt at such length on the wonders of Sais and the Labyrinth would not have been silent about the monuments of Thebes if he had actually seen them. At Elephantine, too, he would have gained more accurate knowledge of the southward course of the Nile than that displayed in his following remarks. See ch. 3, note 7. 8 So far thia is quite correct, the boats being dragged through the rapids of the First Cataract by the aid of ropes. But it does not take four days to pass them. The "shooting" of the rapids can easily be performed in five hours. • The boat has to wind considerably in order to avoid the rocks of the cataract. When the cataract is passed, however, the Nile can no longer be described as "winding." Twelve skcerux would be 720 stades (ch. 6), i.e. about
88 miles, which would carry the traveller far below the Firat Cataract, and as far south as Kalabsheh. Inscriptions at Philje mention a district of twelve ar or arudr on both sides of the Nile from Assuan to Takamsu (Takhompso), where tithes were paid to Isis of , Philse. ^ There is no smooth plain through which the Nile flows around an island after passing the First Cataract. The river is shut in by cliffs most of the way to the Second Cataract. Ptolemy places Metacompso (now Kobban) opposite Pselkis (bakkeh) ; but the river here flows between cliffs, there is no island, and Metacompso was a fortress of brick, built in the time of the eighteenth dynasty, which still exists. By Takhompso Herodotos must have intended Philae, five miles from Elephantine, and called Pilak by the Egyptians. Mr. Bunbury, however, would identify Takhompso with Derar, an islet near Dakkeh, considering that Herodotos has confounded the First Cataract with the district called Dodekaskoenos by Ptolemy between Syene and Pselkis. The same district is named in a Greek graflito at Pliilse of the age of Tiberius. ' Nubians, not n^proes.

' There is no lake, great or small, between Elephantine and the Second Cataract. * Eorosko is the usual starting-point of the caravans for Khartflm ; hence it is a journey of three weeks across the desert, after which the river is rejoined. ' The round number forty must be noticed ; its use in the Old Testament to express an indefinite number is well known. The Nile is not navigable from Wadi Helfa (on the northern side of the Second Cataract) to Semneh, forty -five miles distant, and after that there are occasional rapids till the Third Cataract is passed. ^

' The rest of the Ethiopians " in opposition to the nomads. The island of Meroe was formed by the three rivers Astapos (Bahr el-Azrek), Astaboras (Atbara), and the main stream of the Nile. The city was near the modern Denkaleh, and several of its pyramids still remain. Its Egyptian name was Berua (or Mer, "the white city"), and it seems to have succeeded to the position of Napata, the capital of Northern Ethiopia (To- Kens) up to the age of the Ptolemies. Beyond Meroe came the land of Alo (the Aloah of the mediteval Arab geographers). According to Josephos, Meroe was the Saba or Seba of the Old Testament (cp. Is. xviii.) In the time of Assur-bani-pal Egypt seems to
be described as consisting of the countries of Magan and JMelukh, and Melukh accordingly has been identified with Meroe
;
but originally Magan was the Accadian designation of the Sinaitic Peninsula, the land of "copper" and "turquoise," 80 that Melukh must be sought in the same region. There is no likeness between Melukh and Berua. Ethiopia is Kush in both the Egyjitiau and the Assyrian inscriptions. ' Amun and Osiris. But they were by no means the only gods worshipped in Cush or Ethiopia. Besides the native gods, the Egyptian pantheon had been transferred thither after the conquest of the country by the Egyptians, ^ The oracle of Meroe was famous. It was worked by priests and moving statues. The priests of Meroe succeeded in reducing the kings to mere puppets, whose lives even were at their mercy, until Ergamenes, who has left his name in the Nubian temple of Dakkeh, rebelled in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphoe, entered "The Golden Chapel," and put them to death. The Meroe intended here was not the Meroe of Strabo and the later geographers, but Nap or Napata, built by the Egyptian kings on the sacred Gebel-Barkal. The temple of Amun stood at the foot of the mountain, and an inscription tells us how the "sect, odious to God, called Tum-pesiu-Pertot

Khaiu " ("cook not, let violence slay," probably in reference to the Abyssinian liabit of eating raw flesh), were forbidden to enter it. The description of the election of Aspalut to the crown states that the "royal brothers" passed before the statue of Amun, who finally selected Aspalut, seizing him and declaring him to be king. The Theban priests had already invented statues which could move the head, according to the legend of Ramses XII. and the princess of Bakhten. King Horsiatef consults the oracle before going to war against '
' the lands of Khedi." See Maspero in the Ann. de VAss. pour I'Enc. des Et. grecques, 1877, pp. 124 sq. * As, according to Herodotos, it took fifty-six days to get from Elephantine to Meroe, anotlier fifty-six days would be required to reach the country of the Deserters. This would bring us into Abyssinia. Asmakh has been connected by De Horrack with the Egjrptian semhi, " left" ; but the best MSS. read 'A<rx<£/*, which reminds us of the old Abyssinian city Axum. Moreover, Egyptian h is not represented by Greek Xj ^"d the story of Diodoros that the Asmakh deserted because the Greek mercenaries were placed on the right of the king is plainly fictitious, the left being among the Egyptians the post of honour. Wiedemann doubts the legend altogether, and believes it to have been an attempt to explain the existence of Egyptian colonists in Ethiopia, who settled in the country in the time of the Ethiopian dynasty. The number 240,000 is not
only a round one, but far too high ; and it is absurd to suppose that so large a body of armed men could have peacefully marched through the whole of Egj'pt, evading the strong fortress of Memphis, and running away into the far south, whither they were pursued by tlie king with a handful of foreign mercenaries. The longest of the Greek inscriptions, however, written on the leg of one of the colossi of Abu-Simbel, goes to show that Psammetikhos and his Greek soldiers actually made an expedition into Nubia. Wiedemann, indeed, refers the inscription to the Ethiopian expedition of Psammetikhos II. (b.c. 594), mentioned by Herodotos (ii. 161) and Aristeas. But the cartouches of Psammetikhos II. are not found further south than Philae, and Herodotos expressly ascribes the expedition to the south with the Greek mercenaries to Psammetikhos I. In any case the Ionic inscriptions of Abu-Simbel are among the earliest Greek inscriptions known, and, scratched as they were by mere soldiers, show that reading and writing were commonly taught at the time in the schools of Ionia. The '
' deserters " are also called Sembrites or Sebritae, meaning "strangers" (Strab. xviL p. 541), living in Tenesis, inland from the port of Saba, as well as Makhlaeonians (Hesykh. ) In the time of Strabo they were governed by a queen. ^ Daphne, the Tahpauhes of the Old Testament, was sixteen Roman miles from Pelusium. Brugsch identifies it with the Egyptian Tabenet, now Tel Defennoh. irp6s here is "on the side of," i.t.

* " Runs pai-allel to ,the Ister." Herodotos regarded Europe and Africa as equal, and consequently balancing one another. It was necessary to this equibalance that they should each he divided by a large river, which followed much the same course, and was of the same length. It is very doubtful whether the Kelts had penetrated as far as the Pyrenees in the time of Herodotos. To call the latter a city, and to suppose that the Danube rose so far to the west, does not show that the Danube was "better known" to Herodotos than the Nile. As Mr. Bunbury points out, Herodotos imagined the Nile to flow due east from its sources to Elephantine. • The pillars of Herakles are the two peaks of Kalpe and Abila, which face one another on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar. The Phoenicians termed
them the columns of Melkarth, the sungod, and Melkarth was the Herakles of the Greeks. The Kynesiaus are also called KivTiret. Herod6ros of Herakleia, a contemporary of Sokrates, mentioned them {Fr. 20), and stated that their northern neighbours were the FX^ei. Avienus places them on the Anas or Guadiana. They represent the prseAryan population of Eurojie, and possibly were related to the ancestors of the Basques. * Istria or Istrianopolis, founded about the time of the Skythian invasion of Asia, lay near the modem Kosten^je, and consequently sixty miles to the south of the most southern mouth of the Danube. * See i. 72, note 5. * This is a flagrant instance of Herod

otos's ignorance of geograiihy.

by the modern Egyptians when they cannot afford to buy wheat. ^ Mud was mixed with the feet, not with the hands, as the moninnental representations of brick-making show. * Does Herodotos mean that other people took up manure with their feet ? " See ch. 104, Herodotos had no grounds for asserting that the Syrians (i.e. the Hebrews and Phoenicians), the Ethiopians, the Kolkhians, the Makronians, and the Syrians (i.e. the Hittites) of Kappadokia (to whom Josephos, Antiq. i. xii., see also Cont. Ap. i. 22, adds the Arabs), learned the rite of circumcision from the Egyptians. This, indeed, was impossible in the case of the Kolkhians ; and the rite is found practised by various tribes in different parts of the world who have had no intercourse with one another. It has been traced to an earlier form of self-mutila- • tion, and has survived partly from sanitary reasons, partly as a mark of religious distinction. The first instinct of man
was to give the deity his best and dearest. See ch. 104. ^ The men wore a long robe over the loin-cloth, but threw it off when at work. The upper classes often wore an additional garment. * The hieratic and demotic are written from right to left, the hieroglyphics either from right to left, or from left to right, or vertically. The statement of Herodotos about Greek writing shows that he was unacquainted with any specimens of writing which either ran in the old direction from right to left, or in the later botistrophedon fasliion. We may infer therefore that all the MSS. , accessible to him were written from left to right. ' Really three, but demotic had probably entirely superseded the earlier hieratic cursive in the time of Herodotos. See Appendix I. * Gold, glass, and porcelain were also used. • See ch. 81.

The sandals of those who were not priests were made of palm leaves and leather as well as of papyrus, and fhose worn by the upper classes and women generally had the points turned up. No foot -covering was worn until the time of the fifth dynasty, and in later times even the richer classes often went barefoot like the majority of the modern inhabitants of Egypt.

^ This prohibition, which was not extended to the rest of the community, was probably a survival from a time when there was a superstitious dislike to eat fish, such as still exists in many parts of the eastern world as well as
among the Highlanders, fish being supposed to cause fever, or some similar malady. Fish alone were not offered to the gods. ^ The son might not only become the priest of some other god, and so enter another college, but also practise some other profession, such as that of the soldier. The high priest was called Sem, and there were five priestly grades. ^ i.e. Apis, Egyptian Hapi, who was identified with Epaphos on account of the similarity of name. The monuments show that bulls with black, red, and white hairs were killed both for the temples and for the private houses. Apia stood at the head of the four sacred beasts (Apis of Memphis, Mena or Mnevis of Heliopolis, Bak of Uermonthis, and Tamur). Compare iii. 28.

with Argos being really due to the identity of sound between the name of the city of Argos and that of Argos, the "bright" sky, with its thousand eyelike stars {which Here (swara, "the heaven,") had deputed to watch 18. 18 originally meant "the wanderer," from ya "to go" (whence elfu, ire, etc.); hence the story of her wanderings. The moon goddess was given the horns of a cow from her crescent shape. Southward of Cairo, the new moon rests on its back, instead of one of its horns, making the likeness to the horns of a cow very complete. Hence it was that the cow was sacred to the moon. It is probable, however, that the Greek legend which connects the cow with 18 was derived from the Phoenician conception of the moon -goddess "Astarte, with
the crescent-horns." See ch. 153, note 9. ^ The Egyptians considered the Greeks (like other foreigners) unclean, not only because they killed the cow, but also because they ate swine's flesh, and did not practise circumcision. In this they agreed with their modem Mohammedan descendants. 8 Egyptian bari, "a Nile boat," already found on monuments of the eighteenth dynasty. " Pros8piti8 lay between the Kanopic and Sebennytic branches of the Nile ; Atarbekhis being Aphroditopolis, or "the city of Hathor." It is im|)ossible to suppose that all the bulls of Egypt were buried there, or that the Nile was j)olluted by the corpses of heifers. Herodotos has here found another mare's nest.

^ The Egyptian deities were originally local, but were united into one pantheon after the unification of the empire. The special god of a city or nome, however, continued to be honoured as its chief deity, as, e.g. Amun at Thebes, or Ptah at Memphis. Some local deities never became national, and the sacred animals or totems of one district were not sacred in another. Thus the crocodile was worshipped at Ombos, Athribis, and the region of Lake Mceris, but abhorred and hunted down at Dendera, Herakleopolis, and Apollinopolis Magna. Tlie extension of the Osiris myth throughout the whole of Egypt indicates its rise after the foundation of the united monarchy by Menes. Goats were naturally offered to the ram-headed Amun (-Knuph), who came to absorb all the other members of the pantheon after the rise of the Theban dynasties.
" The ruins of Mendes (Egyptian Pibineb-tat) have lately been excavated eleven miles east of Mansurah (on the Damietta branch of the Nile). The god Mend^ is probably the Egyptian Ba-en-Tat, also called Ba-neb-Tat ("the soul, the lord of Abusir ") who is ram-headed. ' Amun means '"the hidden one," as Manetho rightly stated, and this, coupled with his ram's head when representing Khnum or Knuph, no doubt gave rise to the myth. Hcrakles is Khunsu or Khons (also Shu), who, with Amun and the maternal principle Mut, forms the Theban Triad, and as being "the destroyer of enemies " and" the wandering moon-god, was identified with Heracles by the G reeks. • See ch. 32, note 4. • "Strike themselves {i.e. lament) for the ram." • The twelve gods are probably an invention of the Greeks ; comp. the altar

of the twelve gods in the Troad, and the twelve gods of Etruria presiding over the twelve months of the year. According to Manetho, as quoted by Syncellus, after the seven gods for 13,900 years, came a dynasty of eight heroes (Ares, Anubis, Herakles, Apollo, Ammon, Tithoes, Z6sos, and Zeus), for 1255 years (reduced to 189 by Syncellus). These were followed by other kings for 1817 years, then 30 Memphites for 1790 years, next 10 Thinites 350 years, after whom came "manes" and demigods for 5813. These prehistoric dynasties ended with Bytis, and were succeecled by Menes. From Hephaestos (Ptah) to Menes were 24,900 years. After Horus, the last of the first divine dynasty, the Turin Papyrus gives Thoth for 7226 years, then Thmei, and then the younger Horus, after whom seems to come a summation of the demigods followed by the name of Menes. See the end of this ch.
^ Because the mythologists made Amphitryon the descendant of ^gyptos, and Alkmcue of Perseus, and so of iEgyptos. The Greek Herakles (corresponding with Sansk. suryas, " the sun," for swar-yas, like Hera) is the Tyrian Melkarth, the sun-god, and his twelve labours have their prototype in the twelve labours of the solar hero of the great Chaldean epic. ' "If indeed the Egyptians." • The fii-st divine dynasty contained seven, not eight gods ; and the demigods were not twelve, but eight, according to Manetho. The secondary deities were not sprung from the primary. In ch. 145 Herodotos reckons 15,000 years from Dionysos (Osiris) to Menes. Since Osiris was included in the first divine dynasty, while Herakles belonged to the second of demigods or heroes, Herodotos had again misunderstood Lis informants. See ch. 145.

' The tf'mple of Mclkarth stood in insular Tyre, probably a little southward of the ruined Crusaders' Cathedral. The two upright cones of stone were the Asherim (mistranslated "groves") of the Old Testament, the symbols of the goddess of fertility, which stood at the entrance of the Phoenician temples of the sun-god. Compare the two "pillars" Jachin and Boaz ("establishment" and "strength") at the entrance of Solomon's Temple, which was built by Phoenicians (1 Kings vii. 21). The "emerald" pillar was probably of green glass. Movers makes the pillars the Khammdnim or "sun-images" of the Old Testament. "Tyre is the Heb. ts6r, "a rock." Sidon was considered tlie older settlement.
" The gold-mines of Thasos were first worked by the Phoenician colonists. The temple of the Thasian Melkarth jierhaps stood on the little hill of ElMa'shflk ("the beloved," i.e. Adonis the sun-god), facing Tyre at the eastern end of the isthmus which joins the island to the mainland. The title "Thasian"!
has probably nothing to do with the
|
island of Thasos. Europa, the daughter of Agenor or Khna (Canaan), and sister of Phoenix and Kadmos, represents Astarte, who, under the form of a cow, was the bride of the bull, the symlwl of the sun-god. The name was first applied to Btrotia, where the Phoenicians were long settled. Possibly it is the Heb. 'ercbh, "the west"; to which a VolkMlymologie has given a Gn^ek appearance. See i. 2, note 7.

" See ch. 43, note 9. Khem is meant ' Herein agreeing with Jews, Mohamby Pan. Hence Khemmis is the Greek medans, and Hindus, as well as with Panopolia. Herodotos here confuses the more refined portion of modern Khem and Mcndes together. No Egypt- European society.

' Isis and Osiris. Bnigsch makes Selene the Egyptian Suben, whose chief seat of worship was El-Kab (Eileithyopolis). Droves of swine have been found represented on the walls of the tombs here. * Probably another attempt of Herodotos to cover his ignorance. See ch. 3, note 9. * The civilisation of China has discovered an equally cheap way of appeasing the gods with paper figures. ^ Aopwla was the first day of the Ionic feast Apaturia. It here seems to have the general sense of "the beginning of the feast." ^ Two MSS. read xofpwi', but x^pw** is the reading of the three best, and most suits the context, the meaning being that the Egyptians have no '
' choral dances.
"
* " In no way much less than the rest
of the body." Cp. v. 38. The feast of the ithyphallic Min (Khem) took place on the 26th of Pachon, in the time of Ramses III. * Herodotos has confused the feast of Osiris with that of Khem. " Melampous, nephew of Neleos, king of Pylos, and brother of Bias, the soothsayer, was himself a prophet and a physician. Serpents had licked his ears, and so given him understanding of the language of binls and knowledge of the future. He healed the daughters of Prcetos with hellebore, and restored the women of Argos to their reason. The introduction of the worship of Dionysos, ascribed to him, seems to indicate that the myth has embodied traditions of " swarth- footed " Phoenicians, and justifies the statement of Herodotos at the end of the chapter.

' Beginning to be reckoned among Hellenes." See i. 67, note 1. ^ " Has been initiated into the mysteries of the Kabeiri." The Kabeiri were the eight Phcenician Kabbirvm or K6birim, "the strong (or great) ones," of whom Eshmun ("the eighth"), identified with Asklepios, was the youngest. Perhaps they originally represented the planets, Eshmun being a form of the supreme god. According to Sanchoniathon {Phil. Byb. 11), they were the seven sons of Sydyk or Sadykos, "the just." The mother of Eshmun (Damascius, VU. Isid.) was Astronoe, i.e. Astarte. The Greeks identified them with the Dioskuri, "the sons of Zeus," i.e. El, the supreme god, who was the father of the seven Titans (a Greek translation of Kabeiri), and of whom Sydyk was a title. Their worship in Lemnos and Samothrake shows that these islands once possessed Phoenician colonies, which Herodotos calls Pelasgic, i.e. prehistoric Greek writers vary as to their number as worshipped in these
islands ; the scholiast on ApoUon. (i. 917) makes them four, Axieros or Demeter, Axiokersa or Persephone, Axiokersos or Aides, and Kasmilos or Hermes ; Akusilaos and Pherekydes reckoned only three
;
others only two (Zeus and Dionysos). M. James Darmesteter (Mim. de la Soe. de Linguistiquc, iv. 2) seeks to identify them with the '
' Sons of God " of Gen. vi. 2, and supposes the legend to have originally run :
'
' The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and left for them the daughters of God (i.e. the seven Kabciridcs or women of Lemnos) ; the daughters of God slew them." See Herodotos, iii. 37. The old Aryan god Hermes (the Vedic S&ramcyas, the dog of the dawn) was changed into the Phoenician Kasmilos, who presided over generation. ' Qt6i probably stands for Oeffit, from 6t; dha, the root of tWij/u, so that the etymology of Herodotos seems to be correct. At any rate phonetic laws jirevent us from connecting the word with detu and its kindred.

' The statement of Herodotos about the names of the gods is as incorrect as his other surmises about the Pelasgians. The Greeks brought most of the names of their deities with them from the early home where they had lived before the separation of the Aryan family. But Dionysos certainly was of later importation, and came from the east, either from the Phoenicians or from the Hittites. • As Homer and Hesiod are here said to have formed the Greek theogony, Herodotos must understand by Homer all that mass of epic literature which in after times was called Cyclic, and distributed among various authors, together with the '* Homeric " hymns. The date of Homer largely depended on the birthplace assigned to him, i.e. to the rise of epic poetry, or the formation of guilds of rhapsodists in different localities, particular dates being connected with particular places. Krates placed him B.c.
1100, the author of the life of Herodotos B.C. 1104, Eratosthenes B.c. 1084, Aristotle and Aristarkhos in the age of the Ionic migration (b.c. 1144), the Ehians in the ninth century B.C., Euphorion and Theopompos in the age of Gyges B.C. 670. In their present form, however, the Iliad and Odyssey bear traces of the age of Perikles, and the mass of epic and didactic literature which went under the names of Homer and Hesiod must have been of slow growth. Homer is a name rather than a person, and 6n7jpos, "the fitted together," is applied by Euripides {A Ik. 870) to the marriage-bond. Why Herodotos has fixed on his particular date is clear from ch. 145, where he places the Trojan War 800 years before his own time. Dividing this 800 years in half gave him 400 years before himself for Homer. ' Linos, Orpheos, Musteos, etc.

to find the ThesprStians reckoned as Hellenes ; D6d6na, however, was an Hellenic sanctuary. ' Such an assertion goes to show that Herodotos could not have visited Thebes, * "Divination by means of victims." This has been practised widely over the globe, and was not confined to Egypt and Greece, as Herodotos imagined. * irpoaar/. refers to the litanies and hymns which were sung to the sound of musical instruments. Separate calendars of feasts were possessed by each of the principal towns. In the time of the Old Empire the festival calendar of Memphis was : (1) Feast of the beginning of the year ; (2) Feast of Thoth ; (3) of the New Year ; (4) of Uaka ; (5) of Sokharis ; (6) of the greater and lesser burning ; (7) of holocausts ; (8) of the manifestation of Khem ; (9) of Sat ; (10) of the first of the month ; (11) of the first
of the half month. Under the twelfth djTiasty were added (12) the feast of Osiris, and (13) that of the Epagoinense. The feast or heb usually lasted five days. * Sekhet or Bast, the lion-headed and cat-headed goddess of Bubastis (Pi-Bast, now Tel Bast, near Zagazig), to whom the cat was sacred, was daughter of Ra, and bride of Ptah, and symbolised sexual passion. Her festival took place on the 16th of Khoiak (about Christmas). Bast (also called Menk) and Sekhet were also regarded as sisters. See ch. 137, note 4. '' The site of Busiris (Abuair) is now famous for its pyramids of the fifth dynasty. So far from being in the middle of the Delta, however, it lies beyond it to the south-east of Gizeh. The Busiris meant by Herodotos must therefore be another town, P- User- neb

the Lud or Lydians of Jer. xlvi. 9, and Ezek. XXX. 5. * Papremis is probably the Egyptian Rem, the name being P-ap-rem, "city of the (goddess) Ap of Rem." The Papremitic nome lay between the Khemmitic and Saitic. ' Chariots with four -spoked wheels characterise early Greek coins. The
wheels of the Hittite chariots, as represented on the Egyptian monuments, have four spokes. Those of Egypt have four,
six, and eight — generally six. Persian
chariots usually have eight spokes, but one given by Ker Porter has eleven. " Herodotos seems to have confounded the legend of Horus with what he was told about Mentu-Ra.

* In old Egyptian the crocodile was em,-suh (motlem Arabic, timsahh), em-stih meaning "that which (is) from the egg." The lonians are the Greek mercenaries of Psammetikhos I. ' In the time of the Old Empire the hippopotamus inhabited the Delta, as appears from a picture in the tomb of Ti (an official of the fifth dynasty) at Sakkarah. In the time of Pliny (N. IT. xxviii. 8), it was still found in Upper Egypt. St. John describes it as existing opposite to Abii-Simbel forty or fifty years ago, but it is now not met with north of the Tliird Cataract. * It is not cloven-footed, but has four small toes. ' It has no mane, and the tail, nearly
trilateral at the end, is unlike that of a horse. ^ It does not neigh. 2 It is far larger than the ox, averaging sixteen or eighteen feet long. 8 Herodotos means whips ("kurbashes.") • If Herodotos means otters, he has made a mistake, as otters do not exist in Egypt. " To these should be added the oxyrhinchns. * The Nile-goose was the symbol of Seb, the earth-god, but was not sacred. ^ The bennu, "Phoenix," or bird of Ra, was worshipped at Heliopolis. It is the k/u)l or khul of Job. xxix. 18. The periotl of 500 years represents the 1500

;
its connection with the Phoenix is due to the association of the latter with the sun. In the Book of the Dead it ia said :
'
' The Bennu is Osiris ; in Heliopolis the verifier of things visible and invisible is his body ... it is an age and an eternity." * Had Herodotos actually seen it upon the monuments, he would have known that it was not an eagle but a heron. ' The cerastes or horned viper was not sacred, and is extremely venomous. The equally poisonous asp, however, was sacred to Khnum, and \s'as the symbol of the goddess Ranno. * It is difficult to believe that Herod
otos actually visited the spot he describes. He seems to have attempted to give probability and local colouring to a traveller's tale he had heard by telling it in the first person. Neither Tep nor Pi-Ut(S in Upper Egypt (see ch. 59, note 9) were opposite Arabia, unless by the latter Herodotos means the Arabian side of the Nile. The winged serpenta belong to mythical zoology, and were perhaps suggested by the monumental snakes with bird's wings and human legs. The gorge reminds us of the valley of the roc in the Arabian Nights. Hero<lotos can hardly have believed that tliere was only one entrance into Egj'pt from the east for winged creatures. See iii. 107.

best kinds being those of Mareotis, Anthylla, Plinthine, and Koptos, the Teniotic, Sebennytic, and Alexandrian. Wine is represented in the tombs of the fourth dynasty, and the monuments mention " white wine," the wine of Lower Egypt, southern wine, and "fisher's wine," besides wines imported from Syria. Beer was only drunk by the poorer classes because it was cheaper than wine. It was called heka, and was as old as the time of the fourth dynasty. Two kinds of beer were also imported from Kati (to the east of Egypt), alcoholic and mild, the latter being employed in medicine. Spirits were made from must, and mention is made of spiced wine. A cellar of Seti II. contained as many as 1600 jars of wine.

' With both painting and carving." Many months often elapsed between the embalming of the corpse and its removal to the tomb, during which liturgical services were held over the mummy and funeral feasts were made. The introduction of the mummy into tlie banquet, no doubt, took place at the latter. ^ "The air of Linos" (see II. xviii. 570). As Herodotos did not understand Egyptian, it is only the air that he can be referring to. The plaintive melody of most primitive peoples is the same, and had Herodotos travelled in the High
lauds of Scotland, he would have heard there the same air. According to Athenaeus {Deipn. xiv. p. 620), Nymphis made ManerOs a youth who went to fetch water for the reapers and never returned, like the youths of European legend who are carried away by the water-spirits. The "first king of Egyjit" woidd not be Menes, but Ptah. ManerSs is the Egyptian ma-n-hra, "come back to me," the words of a refrain in which Isis mourns for her lost brother and husband, Osiris. Linos is the same as AlXtvos, the refrain of the Phoenician lament (at ISnu, '
' woe to us "), which was introduced into Greece, where it was supposed to mean, " Woe, Linos." Hence the mythical name Linos. The lament was sung throughout the Semitic world by the women, "weeping for Tammuz" (the old Accadian sun -god Dumu-zi, "son of life," or "only son"), called adoimi, "lord" (Ad6nis) in Phoenician, Duzu (whence the Greek Thoas and Theias) in Assyrian, Tammuz in Hebrew (Ezek. viii. 14), Attys in Phrygia and Lydia, Bormos in Bithynia, ami Hylas in Mysia. Byblos (Gebal) was the chief Phcenician seat of the thrto days' mourning for Adflnis, slain by the boar's tusk of winter ; and after the introduction of Egyptian influence into Phoenicia, and the consequent identifi

cation of Osiris and Addnis, the mummycase containing the limbs of the dead sun-god Osiris was believed to have been found there. An early Babylonian myth makes Istar (Aphrodite) descend into Hades in search of her husband Tammuz. * Wo find from the sculptures that the usual dress was not a tunic properly BO called, but a kilt extending from the waist to a little above the knee. The woollen upper garment is not represented on the monuments. One or two examples occur of a kilt with figures, and
a scribe is represented in a skirt or tunic, which, however, was probably an upper garment worn over the kilt. ' See ch. 37. In a hot climate, where vermin are abundant, the reluctance to use woollen garments was salutary. The "Orphic and Bacchic rites" were importations from the East. ^ " This the Greek i)oet8 have turned to account." Babylonia, rather than Egyi)t, was tlie country from which the West derived its astrology and its horoscopes.

empire, still exists near Mitrahenny; and two miles south of Memphis, Linant Bey has recognised the point where the Nile was turned in an easterly direction. We may provisionally place the date of Menes with Mariette, at 5004 B.C. * "In order that it may run cut ofiF from its old channel . . . secured every year." The MSS. read fiiet. * "And next," answering to rouro fiiv above. The site of the temple of Ptah (Hephsestos), with its sacred lake, can still be traced, the fallen colossos of Ramses II. having stood in front of it. * Varying lists of kings were kept in the principal cities of Egypt, owing partly to the fact that at various periods Egypt was divided into several kingdoms, one dynasty being considered legitimate in one city, another in another ; partly to the omission of monarchs in the several lists. The kings given by Eratosthenes were taken from the Theban list. The 330 kings ended with Moeris
N
(ch. 101) or Amen-em-hat III. of the 'twelfth dynasty. The number is a round one, like the 350 kings who Sargon states preceded him on the throne of Assyria, and is plainly fictitious. According to Africanus, Manetho reckoned 204 kings only from Menes to the fourth (t'.e.sixth) monarch of the twelfth dynasty. On the other hand there were no Ethiopian kings of Egypt until after the rise of the New Empire, so that Herodotos cannot have understood his informants properly ; and it is possible that the 330 kings were intended by them to be reckoned down to the beginning of the twenty-sixth dynasty (Psammetikhos I.) ' See last note. ' Egypt was ruled by more than one queen. Two of the most famous were Hatasu, the elder sister of Thothmes III., and Taia, the mother of Amenophis, the heretic (see Appendix I.) * Neitakrit was the last of the sixth dynasty according to Manetho.

Turin Papyrus, however, has after her Nofer-ka, Nefnis, and Ra-ab. ' Merenra Zaf-em-saf, called Menthesouphia by Manetho, according to whom he reigned only one year. ^ If we may argue from the silence of the monuments, this would be perfectly true of the successors of Neitakrit down to Amen-em-hat I., the founder of the twelfth dynasty. But the earlier kings of this latter dynasty were great warriors and builders, which looks as if Moeris were intended to be Amen-em-hat I., who, however, did not construct the lake and its pyramids. Perhaps, however, the Memphite priests took no heed of the glories that were won for Thebes, and the buildings that adorned a rival city. Or, more probably, Hermlotos and his interpreter only half understood what was read to them.
'' See ch. 13, note 5. ^ This is in favour of the idea that the Memphite priests would not allow that any kings could be illustrious who had neglected their own city and temple. Lake Mceris, too, was in the neighbourhood of Memphis rather than of Thebes. ' Ramses II. of the nineteenth dynasty, popularly called Sest&ra, whence the Greek Sesostris. As there was an in* terval of between one and two thousand years between Amcn-em-hat IIL and Ramses II., ^ir2 ro&roiai, "after these," must be taken in a wide sense. 1 The war of Seti I., the father of Ramses II., against the Punt on the coast of Som&la seems to be referred to. For the real character and military feats of Ramses II., see App. I.

' Tablets rather than pillars, like the three cut in the rock by the side of the ancient road at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb or Dog River (the ancient Lykos), eight miles north of Beyrtit. One of these was dedicated by Ramses to Ptah, the second to Ra, and the third to Amun. • "The same inscription as in the case of those who had shown themselves brave." The description of the tablets is wholly imaginary. * No Egyptian sovereign ever penetrated into Europe, or ever heard the name of Skythians and Thrakians. ' This gratuitous falsehood does not raise our opinion of the credibility of Herodotos in regard to objects which he might have seen.
* The Phasis was unknown to both Egyptians and Assyrians. ^ We may gather from this that the story of the Egyptian colony in Kolkhis had been suggested to the guides of Herodotos by his "leading" questions. * The Egyptians are not black skinned, nor have they woolly hair. This warns us against accepting Herodotos as an anthropological authority. As the Egyptians shaved, he had not much opportunity of observing their hair, but seems to have made his observations upon their negro slaves. It is equally difficult to believe that the Eolkhians were black and woolly haired. Certainly none of the numerous races now inhabiting the Kaukasoe are so. But the black skin of

range. The best preserved (discovered by Renouard in 1839) is about 140 feet above the path on the eastern side, and represents a warrior larger than life-size, standing in a niche, who looks southward, holds a spear in the left hand, has a bow at the back, and wears a tiara, a tunic reaching to the knees, and boots with turned up ends. The second, which is an exact repetition of the first, is on a level with the old road, and on its western side, but is much mutilated, and has but lately been brought to light. The dress and style of art, which agree with those of the Hittite sculptures at Bogliaz Keui and Eyuk (in Kappadokia), as well as at Ghiaur Kalessi (near Ancyra) and Ibreez (in Lykaonia), show that the sculptures are Hittite. The first-mentioned figure is also accompanied by an inscription in Hittite hieroglyphics placed between the face of the figure and the top of the spear, which does not seem to have existed in the case of the second figure, where it may have run across the breast. The second figure looks northward. These figures, instead of being memorials of the conquests of Sesostris, are monuments of his most redoubtable enemies, the Hittites, and testify to the extension of their power as far as the iEgean (see Sayce on The Monuments of the Hittites in the Trans. Soe. Bibl. Archteol. vii. 2). The road from Sardes to Smyrna, however, could
hardly have run through Karabel, though it no doubt joined the road to Ephesos at the entrance to the pass, and both figures hold the spear in the right, not left hand. The direct route now from Ephesos to Phokaea is through Smyrna ; in the time of Herodotos the marshes at the mouth of the Hermos seem to have been impassable, and the road then doubled the eastern shoulder of Sipylos, and ran from Magnesia to KymS by the pass of Uzun Hassanly (still used by cattle drivers), and thence to Phoksea (cf. Academxj, April 9, 1881, p. 262). 8 A little over three feet, which is only half the real height. ' The bow is really slung behind the back. 8 The dress is utterly different from that of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. * The characters are hieroglyphs, it is true, but not Egyptian. ^ This must have been the invention of the cicerone. As the Greeks did not know what the origin of the figure was, it is not likely that they would have been able to interpret the long disused characters upon it. * The legend was nearer the truth than the guess of Herodotos. Memnon, the son of the Dawn, was associated with the Homeric K^teians or Hittites, as Mr. Gladstone has shown {Homeric Synchronism, pp. 173 sq.) ' Manetho is said (Joseph, cont. Ap.

' For the geometrical papyrus that has been discovered, see App. I. ' This is perfectly correct. The sundial and gnomon were invented by the Babylonians, who divided the day into twelve caspumi or "double hours." Anaximander set up the first gnomon (or obelisk) in Sparta in B.O. 560 (Diog. Laert. ii. 1). ' Contrary to fact. Not only the kings of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties ruled over Ethiopia, but those of the twelfth also. After the time of Thothmes I., the kings' sons are called " princes of Kush." * i.e. over 51 feet high. The fallen colossos of Eamses II. at Memphis is between 42 and 43 feet in length. One fonnd by Hekekyan Bey is about 34
j
feet (20 cubits = 34 feet). , ^ This reason has plainly a Greek author. • Pherdn is Pharaoh, per-aa or "great
house," the title of the Egyptian kings (like the "sublime Porte"). The real successor of llamses was his son Meneptah I, Herodotos now leaves history behind, and introduces us to the legends which passed current among the ignorant guides and dragomen. They are interesting, however, as examples of the folk-lore of the time and country. Hence it is that the king is not named ; he is simply "a Pharaoh," which Herodotos has mistaken for a proper name. The tale told of him is thoroughly Greek and non - Egj'ptian in character, and must therefore be regarded as belonging not to Egyptian but to Greek folk-lore. There is more than one Kflm el-Ahmar or "Red Mound" in modem Egypt, so called from the heaps of red bricks in the ruins which mark the site of an ancient
city. It was to a similar " Red Mound " that the legend recounted by Herodotos was attachetl.

must have been different in the time of Herodotos. ^ The digamma is absent from this word ; the original line probably ran

KafiTcolKiKa Fipya; but the corrupt reading has been imitated in Od. xv. 105. " Schiifer doubts the authenticity of the passage between brackets, on the ground of rdSe in ch. 117, but it is found in all the MSS. Since Herodotos could quote the Iliad as a separate poem, there is no reason why he should not have quoted the Odyssey as a separate poem also. The reference is to Od. iv. 227-30. « Od. iv. 351-2. The last line docs not scan, since the two dipthongs et

ov cannot be pronounced as one syllable. * A parallel argument would be that Homer knew of the wanderings of
I
Menelaos in Abyssinia, because Egypt bordered on Abyssinia. The logic of Herodotos is as much at fault as his geograpliy.
''
' From these verses, and more especially this passage." The words of Herodotos show that the authorship of the Kypria was in his day commonly ascribed to Homer, like that of other parts of epic literature (see ch. 53, note 6). In the Alexandrine age, when the Iliad and Odyssey alone had come to be marked off as Homeric, it was the fashion to assign the Kypria to Stasinos. If Herodotos had carried out his principle of denying a common Homeric authorship to passages which were inconsistent, he would have had to anticipate Wolf and Lachmann in dividing the Iliad into independent lays.

* "There is not when it did not hap
pen that "= " constantly." ' The old Aryan story of the Masterthief, which the Greek colonists had brought with them into Egypt, was attached by them to the name of Rhampsinitos, who seems to have been Ramses lU., the builder of the pavilion of Medinet Abu at Thebes. The name is a Greek form of Ramessu, pa miter,
'
' Ramses, the god," according to Brugsch. Maspero makes it Ramessu si-Neilh, " R. son of Neith," a title never borne by the Theban kings, but first used by the Saitic princes, which fixes the date of the tale to the period of Psammetikhos and his dynasty. For illustrations of the story, see Duulop-Liebrecht : *'Geschichte der Prosadichtungen," pp. 264
sq., and Schiefner "Ueber einige morgenliindische Fassungen der RhampsinitSage " in the Bulletin de I'Acad. Lap. des Sciences de Saint- Pitersbourg, xiv. pp. 299-315. It is but a variant of that told of Trophonios and Agamedes in the treasury of Hyrieus at Hyria (Paus. ix. 37, 5), of Angelas in Elis (Schol. Aristoph. Clouds, 504), and of Hermes who receives as his reward the title of d.px(>s ^Xi^ewv {Hymn. Herm. 292) ; or again, of the Hindu legend of Karpara and Gata, of the Highland tale of the Shifty Lad, or of the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves in the Arabian Nights. In the Pecorone of Ser Giovanni, a Florentine of the fourteenth century, a Venetian doge takes the place of the Egyptian king.

torted form of this, since it is associated •with a feast of Isis. The Greeks perhaps affixed it to the name of Rhampsinitos in consequence of the representation of Ramses III. seated at draughts with a woman of the harem, which holds a prominent place on the outer wall of his palace at Medlnet Abu. The romance of Setnau, given in a demotic papyrus, describes how Setnau descended into the tomb of Ptah-nofer-ka at Koptoa, and beat the dead man in a game of fifty-two points, thereby gaining possession of a magical book. " Doubt is thrown upon the ceremony by the fact that Herodotos does not say where this particular temple of Isis was.
Amenti, the Egyptian Hades, was guarded by two jackals, the representatives of Anubis, who are accordingly often depicted on the monuments. Herodotos or his informants mistook them for wolves. " Even the faith of Herodotos was not robust enough to swallow the descent of Rhampsinitos into Hades. ' Isis and Osiris. * See Appendix I.

Herodotos having visited Memphis before the pyramids, and having consequently noted down the stories attached to the building of the city before those attached to tlie pyramids, imagined that Kheops must have come after Rhampsini
tos. Kheops—Souphis in Manetho—is the Egyptian Khufu or Shufu, "the longhaired," the builder of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, and the conqueror of the Sinaitic Peninsula' for the sake of the copper and turquoise mines there. So far from being impious, he was a devoted worshipper of the gods, the builder and endower of a temple of Isis, antl even, according to tradition, the author of a religious treatise. His impiety was an invention of the Greeks, like the bad government of his reign. 2 This is in direct contradiction of the monuments. ' See ch. 8, note 1.
*'
' The period during which the people were oppressed in order to make a causeway." Most MSS. read t^ dXXy Xev>
which is not easy to explain. Traces of two causeways still remain, one leading to the Great Pyramid, the other to the Third. The first is only 32 feet broad (not 60 as Herodotos says), and 85 feet high (not 48 as Herodotos makes it). " "Ten years were devoted to this and to the underground chambers on the (rock) platform whereon the ])yramids stand, which he made to be vaults for himself in the midst of an island." There is no trace of a canal, and none could have existed, as the platform on which the pyramids stand is more than 100 feet above the level of the highest inundation at the pi-esent day. « That is, 800 feet. The real length of the side was originally 764 feet, the perpendicular height from 480 to 485 feet, and the height of each sloping side 610 feet ' The stones vary considerably in size.
— Pyramid was abumir in Egyptian. The Greek wortl properly denote«i a pyramid -shaped cake (Atheu. 647 C),

made of wheat (irvp6s), which was compared by the first Ionian settlers in Egypt with the tombs of the ancient Egyptian kings. De Sacy's derivation from the Egyptian article pi {pa), and the Arabic haram, " sacred enclosure," is plainly impossible. * "Or again they might have had only one machine, which, being easily moved, they transferred from tier to tier, when they had chosen the stone ; for let the story be given.
"
* This is plainly contrary to probability. Lepsios has shown that a king, on ascending the throne, built a small pjrramid, and covered it with a fresh coating of stone each year of his reign. Hence the size of the Great Pyramid is explained by the long reign of Kheops. * This was not the kind of inscription placed by Egyptian kings upon their
monuments, and the inscriptions written on the exterior of a pyramid were either funeral formulae of a later date or graffiti. The Greek guide was not likely to be able to read hieroglyphics, and simply guessed at their meaning, which was probably suggested to him by what looked like the head of an onion in the name of Kheops. Lentils, rather than radishes, onions, and garlick, were the staple vegetables of the Egyptian working class. The Great Pyramid was called Khtifu-khut, "the glorious throne (or lights) of Kheops," by the Egyptians. Maspero suggests that the inscription seen by Herodotos was a proscynema to Osiris for a dead person to whom the god is asked to give bread, beef, wine, oil, etc., the inscription being accompanied by the picture of a table on which the food was piled {Annuaire de FAaa. dea Et. grecquea, 1875, p. 17).

8 i.e. 200 feet each side: Pliny is nearer the truth with his 363 Roman feet (about 350 English). The original length was 356| feet, the perpendicular height being 219 feet, and the sloping height 279| feet. The Egyptian name of the Third Pyramid was her, "the upper." The lower part is still covered with its coating of polished granite, the edges of which are bevelled. • For once Herodotos allows that the legend came from the Greeks, not from the "priests." It embodies the old Aryan nursery tale of which the story of Cinderella and her slipper is a familiar illustration. According to Strabo (xvii, p. 1146) Rhod6pis or RhodSpe was called Dorikha by Sapphd. Manetho made the Third Pyramid the work of Nitokris, the queen of the sixth dynasty, whom he described as "rosy-cheeked," and the pyramid really seems to have been finished by another sovereign than its original builder. This fact may have started the Greek legend that it was constructed by RhodOpis, " the rosycheeked." iElian {Var. H. xiii. 33) makes Psammetikhos the king who
married RhodSpis, and the wife of Psammetikhos II. was a Neitakrit or Neitaker ; while the Hellenic proclivities of Psammetikhos I., and the marriage of Amasis to a Greek wife, suggested the rest of the story. ^ Hephaestopolis is not likely to have been the name of an individual, and the introduction of ^op points to the legendary character of the whole story, which Herodotos seems to have heard in Samos. The fables ascribed to jEsop were not UTitten down until the time of Plato (see Wasps, 1259, and Plat. Phcedr. 61), but were merely repeated orally, and, like the epic literature, which was all assigned to a single Homer, were assigned to a single eponymous author. Thus the "fable of .fisop
"
referred to in Aristoph. Birds, 651, is said by the scholiast to have been composed by Arkhilokhos. The number of birthplaces claimed for i£sop, as well as the stories current about him, indicate that he was a creation of the popular mind. The fables can be traced to the old Hindu stories which were turned to a moral account by the Buddhists,

and which we have in the two Sanskrit collections, the Panchatantra and the Hitopade5a. The latter were translated into Persian (Pehlevi) a.d. 570, for Kliosru Nusliirvan, and again into Arabic by Almokaffa about A.D. 770, under the title of the " Kalila and Dimna." The Arabs ascribed the fables to the mythical sage Lokraan, the contemporary of Solomon, whom the Persians regarded as an ugly black slave. The Kalila and Dimna was translated into Greek by Simeon in the eleventh century, and into Hebrew by the Sabbi Joel, the latter becoming the source of our European fables through the Latin rendering of John of Capua. A French rendering of a Persian translation of the Arabic book (made by David Sahid of l8i)ahan), which ascribed the fables to the "Indian sage Bilpay" or Pilpay, appeared in the seventeenth century. Ar<rwiroj may be a Gnecised form of a Lydo-Phry
gian name, \oyoiroi6z is " prose-writer," \6>oj being opposed to im), " verses." ^ " Accordingly iEsop'must have been ladmOn's slave." The usual story, however, was that .^op had been manumitted, was intimate with Krcesos, Solon, and Peisistratos, and had been sent to Delphi as the Ambassador of Krcesos (see Plut. de S. Num. Vind. p. 556 F). There he was thrown from the Hyampsean rock on a charge of sacrilege, according to the scholiast on Aristoph. JFosjm, 1446-9, because he had ridiculed the Delphians for having no landed projwrty, in revenge for which they had hidden one of the sacred vessels in his baggage. • " For a Rhod6pis, that is." 'VoiiSm is Schafer's correction of the "PoiCiiriy of the MSS. Valcknaer reads 'PoSwxwj, Reiske irarA 'VoiQnrw. The construction is the same as in in tUiffat, and results from the fact that the infinitive was originally the dative of a verbal noun,

while wj was the ablative of the demonstrative ("thus"). * "Next after her another whose name." Naukratis shared the character of most seaport to^vns. Founded by the Milesians in the time of Psammetikhos I. , when no foreign traders were allowed to penetrate further into the country (like the Dutch at Nagasaki in Japan), it is now represented by Desuk on the right bank of the Rosetta (KanOpic) branch of the Nile, twenty-six miles south-east of Rosetta. Amasis deprived the Milesians of their monojwly, which they had shared with Samians and iEginetans, and granted similar trading privileges to all Greeks, so that Naukratis became the common factory of Miletos, Khios, Teos, Phdktea, Klazo
mense, Rhodes, Halikarnassos, Euidos, Phaselis, and Mitylene, the temple of Apollo remaining under the superintendence of the Milesians. Porcelain and flower-wreaths were its chief manufactures. * According to Athenseus (Deipn. xiii. p. 596), it was RhodSpis (Dorikha) who was satirised by Sapphd. « Called Sasykhes by Diod. (L 94), who makes him precede Sesostris. He represents Ases-kaf or Shepses-kaf, the successor of Menkara, who built the pyramid called keb, "the cool." This must bo the brick pyramid of Herodotos. 'This can scarcely be anything more than legend. * Two brick pyramids exist at Dab

shiir, cased with limestone, another at Illahdn, and a fourth at How&ra in the Faytim. ' Another "subjective" translation of the guides, which is as Greek in style and spirit as it is non-Egyptian. ^ Ases-kaf of the fourth dynasty, and Sabako of the twenty -fifth, were separated by an interval of more than 3000 years ! The Egyptian king conquered by Sabaka or Sabako was Bak-en-ranf, the Bokkhoris of the Greeks, a native of Sais, who reigned six years. See App. I. Herodotos has misunderstood his informants, or mixed his notes together, as Anysis must be the name cither of a place or of a man, not of both. According to Lcpsius, it was Thennfisis, the name of the island in Lake Menzaleh,
called Elb8 by the Greeks, where Amyrtjeos took refuge, and to which, according to the popular legend, Bak-en-ranf had previously fled. Bak-en-ranf, however, was captured and burned alive by Sabaka. For the history of the Ethiopian dynasty, see App. I. • See ch. 1 40, and preceding note. ' Sabaka, the So of 2 Kings xviL 4, reigned twelve years according to Manetho and the monuments. His successor
was Sabatok —Sebikhos in Manctho—who reigne<l, according to the latter authority, fourteen years. Then came Taharka, Manetho's Tarakos, Old Testament Tirhakah, As.syrian Tarku. Herodotos has amalgamated the three Ethiopian kings into one. * See ch. 59, note 6.

' See note 1 above, and iii. ch. 17. As Amyrtaeos was driven into the marshes B.C. 455, Avhile Rud-Amun (the Urdamane of the Assyrians), the son-inlaw of Tirhakah, was driven out of Egypt after his temporary occupation of it by the Assyrians in b.c. 665, the arithmetic of Herodotos is considerably at fault. After Kud-Amun's death, Mi-Amun-Nut, the son of Tirhakah, again succeeded in occupying Egypt about B.C. 660, and compelling the Assyrian satraps or vassal-kings to acknowledge him. But he soon retired to Napata. * Neither Egyptian nor Assyrian history know anything of this personage. Sennacherib died in B.C. 681, before the conquest of Egypt by his son and successor, Esar-haddon, and therefore long before the expulsion of tlie Ethiopians. The story of the destruction of the Assyrian army is an echo of the biblical account which places it in Palestine, and (in agreement with the Assyrian inscriptions) in the time of Tirhakah,
when he was sole and undisputed master of the whole country. Though priests of Amun usurjied the royal power, the monuments know of no priest of Ptah who did so. Sethos has been identified with Zet, whom Manetho makes the last king of the Tanitic twenty-third dynasty, reigning for thirty-one years. But the chronology makes this impossible, and Sethos is Seti, not Zet. The legend, however, is evidently Egyptian, not Greek, and the name of Sennacherib, as well as the fact of the Assyrian attack, is correct. 8" This is a fresh proof that we have lost little in the Assyrian history of Herodotos. The Egyptian priests called Sennacherib king of the Arabians as being an Asiatic, Arab being the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Shasu or nomads, and some of the expounders of Manetho accordingly called the Hyksos Aral>s (Joseph, c yip. i. 14). Had Herodotos known anything of Assj-rian history he would not have repeated the statement

• Sennacherib defeated Tirhakah at Altaku or Eltekeh. Josephua says he took Pelusion (Antiq. xii. 1), probably because of this passage of Herodotos. 'Airtic. is an accusative absolute ; ainuv = the enemy, ^ Here we have to do again with the Greek dragomen. The story of Sethos was attached to the statue of some deity which was supposed to hold a mouse in its hand. Mice, however, were not sacred in Egypt, nor were they used as symbols or found on the monuments. On the other hand, the Greeks were familiar Avith the conception of Apollo Smintheus, who was represented on coins of Alexandria Troas with a mouse in the hand, and whose statue at Khryse by Skopas had a mouse under the foot, because mice '
' had gnawed the leather of the enemy's arms " (Strab. xiii. p. 416), Eustathios {ad II. i, 39) says that the Trojans reverenced mice "because they gnawed the bow-strings of the enemy," The inscription is as thoroughly nonEgyptian as it is thoroughly Greek. ^ See ch. 100, From Menes to Mceris were 330 kings ; Herodotos has since named eleven others (including Sethos). No Egyptian priest, however ignorant,
II
could have furnished him with his account of these latter, much less have supposed them to have succeeded each other. Indeed, there is clear evidence, from the way in which the story of most of the kings is attached to some monument, that their succession depended on the order of Herodotos's sight-seeing, and the place they accordingly occupied ill his note -book. Consequently the statement that there were 341 kings from Menes to Sethos was not given, as Herodotos asserts, on the authority of the Egyjytian priests, or even on that of the guides, hut was a calculation of his own. This shows how cautious we must be in accepting his assertions. Of course there could not have been an exactly equal number of kings and priests for 341 generations. ^ The arithmetic of Herodotos is at fault ; the number should be 11,366} years, instead of 11,340. But a genera- / tion was counted at 30 years only, not 1 33J, as Herodotos counts it here, ap|)arently for the purpose of being able to reckon more easily ; while a moment's reflection should have taught him tliat a king's reign is not equivalent to a generation.

* " The sun had four times risen out of its usual place." Perhaps, as Mr. Poole suggests, Herodotos misunderstood the statement that the solar risings of the stars had fallen four times on those days of the vague year on which the settings fell in the time of Sethos. " "Hekataeos the prose- writer." Tliere is no disrespect implied in this title (see eh. 134, note 1). But after having been considerably indebted to him, Herodotos now mentions him for the first time, only to contrast his vanity with his own modesty, and to recount the rebuke and mortification lie had received. Hekateeos of Miletos, the son of HSgfisander, took a prominent part in the Ionic revolt (b,c. 500), and died a little after the Persian War. Before the
revolt he had travelled widely and embodied his obscr\'ntions in two works, the geographical F^i xeplodos and the historical re»'eaXo7/oi. His clear and mellifluous style was highly praised by
Hermogcnes and Strabo. —The previous chapters (especially 100 as compared with 142) indicate that the priests with whom Herodotos conversed were the priests of Ptah at Memphis, not of Amun at Thebes. But Herodotos wishes to conceal the fact that he did not ascend the Nile so high as his rival Hekatseos (see ch. 29, note 7). • i.e. 341. The statues were probably those of deities. Note 2 above makes it doubtful wliether Herodotos really saw this actual number. ^ Herodotos aud Hekatseos could not

have seen the same collection of statues, although Herodotos wishes to produce the impression that they did so, since Hekatseos saw the memorials of 345 "generations"; whereas Herodotos saw only 341, although he was in Egypt two generations later than Hekataeos, and should therefore have seen 347.

was applied to the native Egyptian as opposed to slaves and foreigners. Mention is made of Dioskurides, the son of Pirdmis, in the Halikamassian inscription published by Newton {Essays on Art and Arehceology). Pirdmis was probably related to one of the Karian mercenaries in Egypt. Bomi, however, is not found before the Persian
period ; the old Egyptian equivalent being not. ^ For the dynasties of gods and demigods, see ch. 43, note 6. ' For the Osiris myth, see App. I.

Necho shortly afterwards died (b.c. 664), and wlien the Assyrian empire broke into revolt at the instigation of the Viceroy of Babylonia, Psammetikhos procured help from Gyges of Lydia, and managed to shake off the Assyrian yoke, put down his rivals, and become solo and independent monarch of Egypt Possibly he may have fled from his government at the time of the raid of Mi-Amun-nut (see ch. 140, note 7), but the story of his retreat in the marshes is clearly borrowed from the myth of Horus. ' "And afterwards, for a second time, it befalls him during his reign at the hands of." * We learn from the inscriptions of Assur-bani-pal that they had been sent expressly by Gyges to Psammetikhos, to
assist him in his revolt against Assyria. Gyges may have been of Karian descent, the name of his father Daskylos being Karian. Thirteen (still undeciphered) Karian inscriptions have been found at Abu - Simbel, Abydos, Memphis, and Zagazig, besides one in Karia, among the ruins of Kryassos. According to Polysenos, Temanthes, king of Egypt, had been warned by an oracle against cocks, and Psammetikhos therefore took the Karians into pay on account of the crests on their helmets, which were like the crests of cocks, and of which he had heard from his friend, the Karian Pigrcs. After dethroning and killing Temanthes, he gave the Karians the quarter of Memphis, called Karomemphis. This is clearly another version of the legend given by Herodotos.

9 The black bull Apis (Egyptian Hapi) was the ofispring of a white cow by a moonbeam, and was sacred to Ptah, whose "second life" or incarnation he was. He sjrmbolised the generative and creative power of the god, and was therefore the son of the moon, which seems to refashion itself day by day (see eh. 41, note 6). The Apis period was lunar, containing 309 mean synodic months, or nearly twenty-five Egyptian years. The Serapeum discovered by Marietta at Sakkdrah, enclosed the huge granite sarcophagi and mummies of the sacred bulls, upon the entombment of one of whom the chief priest in the reign of Ptolemy Lagds (according to Diod.) spent not only all the money in the treasury
of the temple, but fifty talents of sOver (about £11 , 700) as weU. The votive tablets dedicated to each bull within seventy days of the animal's death state the days, months, and years of a king's reign on which it was born, enthroned, and buried, and are therefore of great chronological value. Apis was identified with Epaphos because of the similarity of name. In the tablets of the Serapeum he is called Apis-Osiris or Asar-Hapi (Serapis). *• This was not the case. To say nothing of the Semitic settlers in the Delta or of the Hyksos, Lybians and allied tribes had been established in Egypt and had served both as a royal bodyguard and as a police since the fourteenth century B.C.

* According to "Wiedemann b,c. 664604. He counted his reign from the death of his father, not from the date of his revolt against the Assyrians. * The length assigned to the siege of Ashdod is absurd. The decay of the Assyrian power terapted'the new dynasty to seek to re-establish the old empire of Egj'pt in Asia. For commercial reasons the subjugation of Phcenicia and Cyprus was important. * The monuments show that the canal was first dug by Ramses II. Three monuments of Darius Hystaspis were found during the construction of the Suez Canal at Serapeum, Shaluf, and a point nearer Suez. The canal was known as the " amnis Ptolemteus " or T/jal'acds irora/xcSi,
though the latter name properly applied to the branch canal which left the Nile near Old Cairo. '' Egyptian Pa-turn ("city of the sungod"), the Pithom of Ex. i. 11, built for Eamses II. by the Hebrews. It lay midway between Pelusium and Tanis (San), and was the capital of the district of which, according to classical writers, Herakleopolis Parva was the chief town. Dr. Birch identifies it with Heroopolis. Herodotos calls it an Arabian city, because it lay on the Araliian side of Egypt * i.e. 114 miles. The real distance is about 90 miles, while the shortest distance from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea is 76 miles. B Clearly exaggerated. Many must

« Cp. i. 127. The similarity of the answers of Kyros and Apries shows that Herodotos considered them what a successful rebel ought to say. ' Wo may infer from this that the real cause of the revolt was the favour shown to the foreign mercenaries. Comp. the story of the Asmakh or deserters. It has been ingeniously suggested that the overthrow of Apries was brought about by the invasion of Nebuchadrezzar, which a cuneiform inscription states took place in tho latter's thirty-seventh year. But this fell in B.c. 567, and Nebuchadrezzar mentions that his opponent was Amasis, and not Apries. According to an Egyptian inscription, tho liabylonians first met the Egyptian forces under Hor at Syene, and were defeated and driven back by them.
Joseph. {Antiq. x. 9, 7) declares that Nebuchadrezzar put the Egyptian king to death, and appointed another in his place. * Below the modern Algam, on the edge of the desert, and near the mouth of the Lykos Canal. Now Meniif. • These castes had no real existence. Children were not obliged to follow the professions of their fathers. Tho mention of interpreters shows that the society described is later than the time of Psammetikhos ; while swineherds are included who could have been as little as the interpreters native Egyptians, to whom swine were an abomination. On the other hand, important professions and trades, such as those of medical men, scribt's, and agriculturists are wholly forgotten. Plato, Diodoros, and Strabo,

state in which the military feeling is strong. In Athens, where the democracy could be led by KleQn the leather-seller, and Hyperboles the lamp-maker, it influenced public life considerably less than at Korinth. * About 22,500 square feet. Consequently 12 arurse were 9 acres. The Egyptian royal cubit was a little more than 20i inches, the ordinary Greek cubit being 18J inches. There were, however, several kinds of cubits in Egypt. Besides the suten md or royal cubit of 7 palms (i.e. 28 digits), there were the lesser cubit {md nets) of 6 palms, and the cubit of 5 palms. Each cubit was dedicated to a god. The t'er was 4 palms, the remen da or greater spithamo SJ palms, the remen nets 3 palms, the tut sen or "two hands" 2 palms, the khep or "foot " 1^ palm, the palm or sap containing 4 tcb or digits, a digit being probably 07366 inch. In
the geometric papyrus the ar seems to be equivalent to the Greek skhcenos, the kJia or pole being the orgyia of 6 feet. See ch. 149, note 2. ' Reading 'Ep/iorv^lup AXXm with two MSS., we should have to translate "as many of the H." ; but it is difficult to extract such a sense out of the pronoun. It is therefore better to understand Herodotos to mean that a thousand soldiers in all acted as bodyguard, Ealesirians and Hermotybians being on duty in alternate years. * Comp. Ezek. xxix. 8, 8, 9. • Wiedemann supposes that Apries survived for six years (b.c. 570-564), hence the twenty-five years of Herotlotos (see ch. 161). But it is not likely that he would have remained a prisoner when Amasis was defeated by Nebuchadrezzar, and all Egypt overrun by the Babylonians (see ch. 163, note 7).

^ This is Phoenician rather than Egyptian work, and indicates that the Egyptian wars in Phoenicia had brought Phoenician artists into Egypt. ' Osiris, see ch. 3, note 9. Yet elsewhere Herodotos has no scruples about mentioning Osiris under his Greek title, Dionysos ! ^ The lake still exists near Sa el-Hager, north of a huge brick wall which encloses an open space and is seventy feet thick. The lake has been made irregular in shape by the fallen masses of rubbish. 8 Cp. Theogn. 7, Kallim. Hymn, ad Del. 261. M. HomoUe's excavations in Deles have shown that the lake was an oval, 289 feet long by 200, in a rectangular enclosure, with a granite wall running round it 4 feet high. The conduit by which it was fed is at the north-east comer. Upon it floated the sacred swans, and hard by were the sacred
palm-tree, the Kepdrivos ^u/ids, where the ancient dance, the yipapos, was performed, and the KUKds ^ufids, round which sailors were whipped with their hands tied behind their backs, while they chewed the leaves of the sacred olive. ^ Osiris, see note 7 above. For the Osiris myth, see App. I., and comp. the lamentations for the death of Tammuz, or Ad6nis, the sun-god, whose legend was ultimately derived from the Accadians of Babylonia. 2 The Thesmophoria were observed at Athens in honour of Demeter Thesmophoros by women clad in white, who went to Eleusis on the 11th of Pyanepsion (the day of the Anodos), the festival beginning on the 14th. The 16th was a fast, and the 17th the last day of the feast, during which the sacrifices called Di6gma or Apodidgma, and Zeraia, were performed. For a similar feast at

Ephesos, see Herodotos, vi. 16 ; and at Thebes, Xen. Hell v. 2, 29. 3 Cp. Schol. on Aristoph. Clouds, 398 ; (the Arkadians claimed to be vpoaiXrjvoi). The human sacrifices offered on the summit of Mount Lykaeos indicate the existence of a non- Aryan population in Arkadia. * Probably Seffeh, north of Sais, Brugsch identifies it with the Egyptian Sotep. " "Held him in no great esteem." The low birth of Amasis (Egyptian Aahmes) is inconsistent with his rank as general and friend of Apries, and his marriage with Ankh-nes-nofer-ap-ra, the latter's sister. But it allowed the Greeks to indulge in their passion for inventing stories about persons in authority. Amasis lost the favour of the priests by handing over to the foreigners some of their best lands at Memphis, Bubastis, and Heliopolis, as we learn from a "demotic chronicle," deciphered by M. R^villout (Eeime igyptologique, 1880). Instead of listening to their demands for justice, and allowing the case to be tried by the supreme court of thirty judges from the sanctuaries of Thebes, Memphis, and Heliopolis, the king caused it to be decided against them by the council of state. The taxes levied by Amasis on the priesthood were renewed by Dareios in the third year of his reign. Hence the hatred of the priestly compilers of the "chronicle" to Amasis, whom they accuse of getting drunk in
the morning (cp. Herodotos in this ch.) on Kelebi wine, and so forgetting the affairs of state. The "chronicle" also states that after his death Kambyses was received "because of his generosity of heart." He "gave up Egypt to his satrap in the year 3," and expelled the "strangers" from the temple of Neith at Sais, restoring to the priests what Amasis had taken from them. This seems to have been in great measure due to Ut'a-Hor-en-pi-res or U^a-Horres-nt, high priest of Neith, who was a friend of Kambyses, and initiated the latter into the mysteries of the Egyptian goddess. The Persian king had so great an affection for him as to take him with him out of Egypt when he left it, and the Egyptian priest only returned to Sais on a confidential mission from Dareios when the latter was in "Aram." Ut'a-Hor-en-pi-res s])eaks of restoring property and fortune to his countrymen in the reign of Dareios, "during the great calamity which took place over the whole earth." This must refer to the general insurrection which broke out after the death of the pseudo-Bardes (Goniates), in which Egypt also shared, as wo learn from an inscription found on the line of the Suez Canal, in which Dareios says, "I am a Persian ; with (the aid of) Persia I conquered Egypt." Tapcrt, the mother of Amasis, was related to Apries (see R^villout in the Jtcv. igyptologique, 1881, pp. 9698).

tinuing to share the island between them. Sargon I. of Babylonia (b.c. 2000) penetrated as far as it, and Sargon II. set up a stele at Larnaka (now at Berlin). The tributary kings of Kypros are enumerated by Esar-haddon and Assur-bani-jml. The Phoenician colonies had previously been subject to Tyre ; and if Asebi means Kypros, the island had been conquered by Thothmes III. Amasis was consequently not the first to compel it to pay tribute.

jars to be distinguished from the myriads of jars (including \i'ine-jars) made in the country ? And why should they alone be carried to the desert? How could all the jars in the country, from the Mediterranean to Assuan, be collected at Memphis? The whole population would have had to be on the tramp for the purpose. Fragments of wine-jars, however, with resinous sediment at the bottom, have been found plentifully in Egypt. The language of Herodotos may imply that he regarded the whole story a.s a joke : "So Mr. jar, after making a pilgrimage to Egypt, and being discharged there, returns to Syria to rejoin his old friends." * "Having loaded it {i.e. tV ia^oKTi)v, 'the pass') with water." Cp. vii. 62, 70, 73, 86. * The Arabs still make a third man witness to an oath. See i. 74, note 1. * Seven was the sacred Semitic number
(as among the Babylonians, the Phoenicians, and the Hebrews), seven being the number of the planets, and of the days of the week which the Accadiaus had named from the planets. The week itself was the fourth part of the old lunar month. Heaps of stones were set up (as they still are in the East) to record oaths and other events, inscribed stelae afterwards taking their place among the cultured Babylonians and Assyrians ; see Gen. xxxi. 46-49 ; Josli. iv. 3-9. So in the great Chaldean epic, Izdubar or Gibirra sets up a Beth-el (or PairvKos, " house-of-god "). ' Most MSS. read 'OporoKr, from the jingle with 'AXiXdr. Movers explains Orotal as Arath el, "fire of god"; but this is not only philologically doubtful, on account of the short initial vowel, but does not suit the identification with Dionysos. Blau compares 'Urundal or Ghurundal, an idol mentioned by Ibn

* Yet, according to ch. 97, Kambysea reduced at this time the Ethiopians far to the south of Meroc (Napata), to which, according to Josephos {Ant. ii. 10), he gave a name. At Persepolis the negroes of this region figure among the nations subject to Persia, and Premnis in Nubia is called the Market or Magazine of Kambyses by Pliny and Ptolemy. Kamby8§s, therefore, really established his empire further south than even Thothmes III., and returned to Memphis a successful conqueror. ' This must be the Southern and Greater Oasis of El-Khargeh, from 6 to 74 days from Thebes. There are remains of a temple built here by Darius in the little town called Hib or "plough" by the Egyptians. According to the Egyptian texts there were seven oases
:
(1) Du-hesmen, " the natron mountains," west of Lower Egypt ; (2) Uit, a small
R
oasis south-west of the first ; (8) Uit mehit, "the Northern Oasis" (now elUah el-Bahharieh) ; (4) Ta-n-ah, "the land of the cow " (now the oasis of Fara•freh) ; (5) Kenem (now Ghanaim, the oasis of Khargeh, "the outer"); (6) Testes (now Dakhel, "the inner," west of the preceding) ; (7) Sokhet-am, " the field of date-palms " (now Sivah, where the temple of Zeus Ammon stood). In all Amun was worshipped (Brugsch). • Herodotos must have made a mistake in the name he gives. Maritime Samians could not have settled in the middle of the desert, 400 miles from the sea. ^khridn is the name of an iambic-writer in a Samian inscription of the fourth century b.c. The name has also been found by Sayce in a Greek graffito in one of the tombs of Tel el-Amama. * A name subsequently applied to the Canary Islands.

The Phoenicians must have borrowed their Pataeki from Egypt, probably identifying them with their own Kabeiri, and making them the sons of Ptah, whom they would then have identified with the creator El. ' For the Kabeiri, see iL 51, note 1. As they were Phoenician gods, the temple was not an Egyptian one. Later writers improved on the legend of the iconoclasticism of Kambyses in Egypt, making him the destroyer of the vocal statue of Memmon (Amenophis III.), which was really thrown down by earthquake, as well as the demolisher of Thebes I ' See note 5. * Comp. the Kalantians of eh. 97, the Ealatians of Hekatffios. See ch. 99,

The same custom was ascribed to the Massagetse (L 216, note 9) and the Issedonians (iv. 26), and by Strabo (xi. pp. 756, 753) to the Derbikes and a tribe on the Caspian.

the end of his reign, and the boys to Alyattes, there must have been an interval of at least fourteen years between the two events. They did not, therefore, take place at the same time. Since the date assigned to Periander is B.c. 625585, it is hard to see how the boys could have been sent to Alyattes,who died about B.C. 560, or how this could have occurred only a generation before the Lakedtenionian expedition against Samos in B.c. 520. Panofka conjectures rplrxi yefff, supposing y (3) to have fallen out before yev., but this only makes the statement about the bowl more difficult to explain. Herodotos, however, had only oral tradition as his authority for these events of preceding J Greek history (oh. 45, note 1). * This illustrates the Asiatising tendency of many of the Greek tyrannies. The same Periander, though one of the seven wise men of Greece, had a nephew who succeeded him of the name of Psammetikhos (Arist^PoZ. v. 12). For Kyp
selos, who overthrew the Bakkhiad oligarchy at Korinth, and whose coffer at Olympia, adorned with Homeric subjects, was one of the earliest specimens of Greek art, see v. 92, where the legend connected with him grew out of liis name and the punning allusion to it in the gift he made to Olympia. • "When the Eorinthians cut the boys off from food. " It seems clear that there was as yet no tyrant in Samos ;' the "Samians " alone arc named. ^ According to Pliny {N. H. ix. 25) and the pseudo-Plut. (who appeals to Antenor and Dionysios the Khalkidian), the Knidians, not the Samians, drove away the Korinthiau guard, and restored the boys to Kerkyra. ' After iwvrdiai Valckenaer would sujiply avyyevie^, Rciske olicfiioi. To&ruf, however, remains without construction. The nominative to ftcnffcw is of course "the Korinthians." For the hostility between Korinth and her colony, Kerkyra or Corfu, see Thuk. i. 18, 26, etc

A deep cutting (30 feet high) ending in a tunnel was made by the Greeks of Myrina to convey the water of the Koja Chai to their city {Academy, April 9th, 1881, p. 262). A tunnel, 1708 feet long, was driven through the southern part of the temple-hill at Jerusalem by one of the Jewish kings, to bring the water of the Virgin's Spring inside the walls, to the artificial reservoir now called the Pool of Siloam. An inscription states that the workmen began simultaneously at both ends, meeting in the middle. 2 i.e. in Greece. See i. 70, note 2. ' Pausanias and Pliny make Rhcekos assist Theoddros of Samos in first casting statues in bronze (see i. 51). Along with Theodfiros and Smilis, he built tiie labyrinth in Lemnos (Plin. N. II. xxxvi. 13). The words of Herodotos imply that the temple had been founded before its completion or restoration in the time of Polykrat^s.
* The Behistun Inscription and Ktesias speak of only one Magos. The inscription calls him Gaumata (Gomates), and states that he came from the mountain of Arakadris, in the district of Pishiyakhuvadaya (not Pa.sargadae, as Oppert asserts). See App. V. * "Took it for granted that he was alive." The continued absence of KambysSs in Egypt had doubtless produced discontent at home. * Not true ; the name was Gaumata. Comp. the Kometes of Trog. Pompeius (Just. L 9). The Sphendadates of Ktesias is the Zend title Speftta-dftta, "given to the Holy One." This substitution of a title for the name gives us a clue to many of the names in Ktesiits. ^ "Having persuaded" (so i. 68, etc.) This causal use of the aorist is confined to Ionic prose (except Antiphon, 117, 11).

•* Perhaps Aspachana, the quiverbearer or messenger of Dareios, according to the Naksh-i-Rustam Inscription, where a portrait of him is given. According to the Behistun Inscription, the conspirator was not Aspachana, but Ardumanish, son of Yahuka. ' Gobryas (Gaubaruva) the Patiskhorian is joined with Aspachana at Naksh-i-Rustam as the lance-bearer of Dareios. He may be the general of Kyros who occupied Babylon and reduced Babylonia. * The list given at Behistun is Vidaframa (Ataphernes in Ktesias, Artaphrenes in iEskhylos, who makes him slay the Magian, Pers. 782), the son of Vayaspara ; Utana, the son of Thukhra ; Gaubaruva, son of Marduniya (Mardonios) ; Vidarna (Idernes in Ktesias), son of Bagdbigna; Bagabukhsha(Megabyzos), son of Diduhya ; and Ardumanish, son of Vahuka, They were all Persians.
Vidarna defeated the Medes during the Median revolt at the beginning of the reign of Dareios. See vii. 135, and for his sons Hydarnes and Sisamnes, vii. 83, 66. His descendants became kings of Armenia down to the time of Alexander the Great (Strab. xi. p. 771). Max Duncker has shown that Ktesias has given the sons of the comrades of Dareios instead of the conspirators themselves {Hist. 0/ Antiquity, Engl. Tr., v. p. 329). His Idem^s is the son of Vidarna, the brother of Sisamnes. So we have Mardonios the son of Gobryas, instead of Gobryes, Anaphes or Onophaa the son of Otanes (Herod. viL 62), instead of Otanes. See note 4 above. ' A mistake ; see note 2 alrave. In the Behistun Inscription, Hystasp^ is satrap of Parthia, not of Persia. ' According to Dareios, " no one dared to say anything concerning Gomates tlie Magian " until he arrived.

* It is clear from this that Herodotos marks: "There were plainly three considered Prexaspes to have returned traditions respecting the discovery of to Persia after the death of Kambys^s the Magos. According to one it was (chh. 63-66). Hence he placed the death made by Dareios himself (ch. 71), accordof the latter during the usurjmtion of ing to another by OtanCs and his daughGoraates, b.c. 622. This is now rendered ters, according to a third by Prexnsp^ doubtful (ch. 62, note 8). Stein re- Herodotos has combined all three."

' "Of the first rank as the Persians considered." Cp. i. 117 ; vi. 70. Dareios had already married a daughter of Gobyras (vii. 2), and he afterwards married Phratagune, daughter of his brother Artanes (vii. 224). The sons of Atossa were Xerxes, Masistes (vii. 82), Akhsemenes (viL 97), and Hystaspes (vii. 64) ; of Artystdne, Arsames and Gobryas (vii. 69, 72). * When he had reconquered the empire he caused the sculptures and great inscription of the sacred rock of Behistun (Bagistana, "place of the gods "), on the road from Babylonia to Hamadan (Agbatana), to be engraved. Sargon mentions a place called Bit-ili (Bethel), "house of the gods," in the same locality. ' See i. 192, note 5. Dareios gives three lists of the " provinces " (dahydva) of the empire, which varied at different periods of his reign. At Behistun he counts twenty- three : Persia, Susiana, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Egypt, the islands of the sea, Saparda, Ionia, iledia, Armenia, Kappadokia, Parthia, Zarangia. Aria, Khorasmin, Baktria, Sogdiana, Gandaria (Candahar), the Sakm, Sattagydia, Arakhosia, and Maka (the Arabian peninsula in the Straits of T
Ormnz). The words " and the maritime districts " are inserted by the Protomedic text, the Babylonian has " Egypt on the sea." Saparda is the 'Saparda of the Assyrian Inscriptions (Scpharad, Ob. 20) south-west of Lake Urumiyeh. For Gandaria the Protomedic and Babylonian texts have Par(r)uparaisanna (Paropanisos), and the Babylonian text replaces the SakiB by the Zimmirrai (or Kurds). The second list is at Persepolis, and includes twenty-three provinces : Susiana, Media, Babylonia, Arabia, Assyria, Egypt, Armenia, Kappadokia, Saparda, Ionia, Sagartia, Parthia, Zarangia, Aria, Baktria, Sogdiana, Khorasmia, Sattagydia, Arakhosia, India, Gandaria, the Sakse, and Maka. The third list on the tomb of Dareios at Naksh-i-Rustam has twenty-nine provinces : Media, Susiana, Parthia. Aria, Baktria, Sogdiana, Khorasmia, Zarangia, Arakhosia, Sattagydia, Gandaria, India, the Amyrgiau Sakae, and the Sakse with pointed caps, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Egypt, Armenia, Kappadokia, Saparda, Ionia (? Kypros), the Sakse of the (Caspian) Sea, Skodria (Skythia), other lonians with jilumes on their heads, Phut (? the Builii), Kush (the Ethiopians), the Matstoiyans (7 Maxyes), and the Karkians (? Carthaginians).

® About twelve miles south of the mouth of the Orontes, now represented by Bosyt. ' The foundation of Mallos was also ascribed to him (Strab. xiv. p. 675). * From Gaza to lenysos (eh. 5). ® Persian Thatagush, Protomedic 'Sattagus. Their exact position is unknown, but they bordered on Kandahar. 1 Now Kandahar (the Gandhdras of the Hindus), see note 5 above. The province is called Paropanisos in the Protomedic and Babylonian texts, a name given by the later Greeks to the Indian Caucasus. The capital was Ortospana or Kabura, now Kabul, in the valley of the K8phen. See ch. 102, note 7. The Gandharas migrated to Kandahar from the Upper Indus in the fifth or sixth century a. d. 2 For the Dadikre see vii. 66. The Aparytffi seem to be the Paryatae of Ptolemy ("mountaineers," from Zend pHrti, "mountain"). In the Vannic
Inscriptions mention is made of the Dadikas or "clan of Dadis," south-west of Lake Urumiyeh. ^ The Kassi of the cuneiform inscriptions who under Khammuragas conquered Babylonia and founded a dynasty there (see Appendix II.) The Kissi or Kossaei (called KAshan by the Syrians) were properly the ancestors of the Lures in the northern mountain borders of Elymais towards Media. * In Smith's Classical Atlas it is conjectured that they may be the Barkanii (the Persian form of Hyrkanii), who bordered on the Medes. Perhaps they
are the Paretakeni of i. 101, —the Part*kanu of Sargon, who makes them a remote Median tribe to the east. Hekatseos mentioned a Persian city, ParikanS. ' Orthokorybantes has been supposed to be a Greek word meaning "those who wear upright tiaras" (like the SaksB of the Naksh-i-Rustam I ascription), and to have been an epithet of the Parikanii,

Rawlinson ingeniously connects the first part of the name with the Zend IrHhwa, "high;" and Jaquet makes the second part the Zend g^rtwantd, "inhabitants." ' The Kaspii lived on the steppes of the lower Kyros and Araxes, and gave their name to the pass of the Kaspian Gates. The Pausikae seem to be the Pasikie or Apasiakae of Strabo, who wore neighbours of the Khorasmians. Comp. tlie Pffisicie of Pliny {N. H. vi. 19). The Pautimathi are unknown. The Dareitje seem to have inhabited Ptolemy's Dareitis, on the borders of Khagiana. ' The Ei^i are probably the Augali of Ptolemy, who lived on the Jaxart6s. C. Miiller acutely corrects the ^gsei of the PoscImI Chron.

* In Gedrosia or Beluchistan, now represented by the dark Brahili, whose black skins caused the Greeks to call them the Ethiopians of Asia. 9 See i. 189, note 6. The Matieni lay on the borders of Armenia and Media (see i. 72). They are the Matai of the Assyrian Inscriptions of whom Khanatsiruca was king in the time of SamasRimmon (b.c. 821). They are called Amadai by Shalmaneser, and are apparently the Madai or Medes of the later texts. As the Kurds, the Kardukhians of Xenophon (the Ziniri or Namri of the Assyrian Inscriptions), are not mentioned, they must have been independent, as they practically are to this day. * See i. 104, note 2. If the name is the same as Sapeires, which Steph. Byz. says was later pronounced Sabeires (the Iberi or Georgians of classical geography, called Vir-k by the Annenians), we may compare the country of Sapira mentioned by Tiglath-Pileser II. as south of Lake Urumiyeh. It may be the same as the Saparda of Sargon (and the Persian Inscriptions), which bordered on the north of Aranzi (Orontes) or Mount Elwend. The Saspeires separate Media from Kolkhis (iv. 37), and must therefore have been regarded a.s extending over a large tiact of country and occupying all Eastern Armenia and a |)ortion of Georgia. ' Sir H. Rawlinson is certainly right in identifying the Alarodians with the
Urardluans of the Assyrian Inscriptions, the inhabitants of Ararat, called Biaina or Van by the natives, who seem to have been the ancestors of the modern Georgians, and were driven northwards by the Aryan Armenians. ^ The Moskhi and Tibareni (Assyrian Muscai and Tublai, Biblical Meshech and Tubal) are generally coupled together in the inscriptions, and originally extended as far south as Melitene and Kummukh, or Komagene, on the east, and Kilikia on the west. The Moskhi were made a Kolkhian tribe by Hekataeos as the Tibareni were by the Scholiast on ApoU. Khod., and the cuneiform inscriptions make the Kaskai their eastern frontagers. In Strabo the mountains about Erzeriim are called Moskhian. * See ii. 104, note 1. ^ See Xen. Anab. v. 4. Mdcaw signified one of the "wooden houses" in which they lived (Dion. Hal. i. 26
;
Strab. p. 549). ' Restored by Voss ; the MSS. have Marsians (two have Mardians). Steph. Byz. makes them neighbours of the Mossynoeki, and they are mentioned by Hekatffios. ' Not "equal to that of the rest," as this was not the case, but {rXfurroy being understood again with <f>6poy) " the largest amount of tribute in comparison with all the rest" (cp. viii. 44 : v^os irpbi irdyrat Toin dXXoui).

* "Aplant of the size of a millet seed." • See i. 216 (of the Massagetse), and ' The description seems to apply rather 201, note 1. The physiological assertion to Buddhist monks than to Brahmins, of Herodotos is not correct, especially when it is said that they eat ' Paktyike (see vii. 67) is north-casteni no animal food, and neither sow nor Afghanistan. The Afghans in the east build. Perhaps, however, it merely re- still call themselves Pakhtun (in the fers to the Yogis or ascetics. Herodotos west Pashtftn). Kaspa tyros, whence seems to have got his information from Skylax started on his exploring expedisome account of the voyage of Skylax of tion, was more correctly named KaspaKaryanda, a city not far from Halikar- pyros by Hekatreos, and is Knspa-puras, nassos. See iv. 44. The Periplus of "the city of the Kaspinns," the ancient Skylax was not written till the follow- name of Kabul (not Kdsyapa-purcu or ing century, but was based on earlier Kashmir, as Wilson supposed). See materials. ch. 91, note 1.

' Babylon revolted twice—first in B.C. 521 under Nidinta-Bilu, who called himself Nebuchadrezzar, son of Nabonidos, and (after ten months, as we learn from the contract - tablets) was captured and put to death in Babylon by Dareios himself, B.C. 520 ; and again in B.c. 515 under the Armenian Arakhu, son of Khaldita, who also pretended to be Nebuchadrezzar, but who was within the year taken and impaled by Intaphernes, the Mede, after the previous capture of Babylon. Neither event, as recorded in the Behistun Inscription, agrees with the account of Herodotos ; and Ktesias
asserted — no doubt correctly—that the siege described by Herodotos really took place in the time of Xerxes, when Z6pyros, the governor of Babylonia, was killed by rebels, and his son Megabyzos mutilated himself, and so avenged his father. Comp. i. 183. The first siege of Babylon by Dareios is probably that ascribed by Herodotos to Kyros ; see i. 190, note 2. It is unlikely that either Zftpyros or Megabyzos could have been,
the one satrap of Babylonia, the other commander-in-chief of the Persian army (ch. 160), after the mutilation of their persons. Orientals dislike to serve under mutilated men (so of Gomates in ch. 73). According to Polysenos (vii. 11) the idea of the mutilation was taken from an attempt made by a Sakan beyond the Oxns to destroy the army of Dareios ; and as we find the same story told of the Persian Firoz, the Indian Kanishka, and the Kashmirian Lalitaditya, not to speak of the Latin Sextus Tarquinius, it is easy to recognise in it, as Sir H. Rawlinson says, a "standard Oriental tale." * The women could easily have been sent into the country, and no mention is made of the children ; while Babylon was a spacious city with gardens and abundant stores of grain. In the two revolts under Dareios, Babylonia, and not Babylon only, shook oflF the Persian yoke, and liabylon was not besieged till after two successive defeats of NidintaBila outside the walls.

speaks of the wall as still encircling {T€fn6f€t) the city (i. 178), Dareios could not have destroyed it. * For the 'good reason, as we now know, that he did not '
' take " Babylon, which voluntarily opened its gates to him. ' This is contrary to the usage and character of Dareios as depicted in the Behistun Inscription. 1 See Thuk. i. 109. He married Amytis, daughter of Xerxes, destroyed the Athenian fleet in Egypt, and sub
dued the country, and, after quarrelling with Artaxerxes (b.c. 447) for not observing the conditions granted to Inards, died full of age and honours. * Ktesias implies that this took place shortly before the death of Artaxerxes Longimanus (b.c. 425). Consequently the final edition of the work of Herod

otos was not published till after this date. Z8pyros was killed while leading the Athenians against the Eaunians, the near neighbours of the youth of Herodotos (L 171).






APPENDICES.
EGYPT.
Egypt, historically the oldest of countries, is geologically the youngest.
It consists entirely of the soil deposited in comparatively recent times
by the Nile. The triangle of the Delta marks the site of the ancient mouth of the river ; and though the land has encroached upon the sea but slightly since the age of the Pharaohs, its height has year by year been slowly increasing. Some of the mouths of the river which were navigable streams in classical times have now ceased to be so ; the Serbonian lake has in part become dry land, while desolate
marshes are now cultivated fields. To the south of the Delta,—with the
exception of the FayAm, which owes its fertility to the canal called
Bahr Yusftf, the former feeder of Lake Moeris,—Egypt is confined to
the narrow strip of mud which lines both sides of the river, and is
bounded by low hills of limestone, or the shifting sands of the desert
The Nile now flows for 1 600 miles without receiving a single tributary
;
the heated deserts on either bank absorb all the moisture of the air, and .almost wholly prevent a rainfall, and it is consequently only where the waters of the river extend during the annual inundation, or
where they can be dispersed by artificial irrigation, that cultivation
and settled life are possible. This, however, was not always the case.
The channels of rivers and water-courses that once fell into the Nile can still be traced on both sides of it, from the Delta to the Second
Cataract ; and the petrified forests that are found in the desert, one about five miles westward of the pyramids of Gizeh, and two others, an hour and a half and four hours to the east of Cairo, show that the desert was not always the barren waste that it now is. The wadis, or valleys, and cliffs are water -worn, and covered with boulders and pebbles, which bear witness to the former existence of mountaintorrents and a considerable amount of rain ; and the discovery of



308 APPENDIX I.
palaeolithic implements near the Little Petrified Forest, and in the
breccia of Kurnah, at Thebes, as well as other geological indications,
make it clear that the geographical and climatic changes the country has undergone have taken place since it was first inhabited by man. It was long maintained that no traces of a prehistoric age existed in Egypt. Arcelin and the Vicomte de Murard, however, in 1868-9, discovered numerous relics of the neolithic age at Gizeh, El Kab, and the Biban el-Muluk, or Valley of the Kings, at Thebes; and MM. Hamy and Fr. Lenormant in 1869 collected further specimens of the same early epoch. Since then neolithic implements and chippings have been found as far south as the Second Cataract, and more especially on the plateau which overlooks Helwan. Though the
discovery was at first disputed by certain Egyptian scholars, who
knew more of the Egyptian monuments than of prehistoric archaeology, no reasonable doubts in regard to it can any longer exist^
It is impossible to calculate the rate at which the deposit of Nilemud is taking place, since the amount deposited varies from year
to year, and the soil left by the inundation of one year may be entirely
carried away by the next. Shafts were sunk in it in ninety -six different places at Memphis by Hekekyan Bey in 1851-4, and in one of them, near the colossal statue of Ramses II., a fragment of pottery w'as found at a depth of 39 feet under strata of soil which had been covered by sand from the desert. As the statue, which was erected in the fourteenth century B.C., is now 10 feet below the surface, it
would seem that the deposits have been increasing at the rate of 3 '5 inches in each century, and that consequently the fragment of pottery is 13,530 years old. Such calculations, however, are exceedingly
precarious, and at Heliopolis the alluvial soil has accumulated to a
height of between 5 and 6 feet around the base of the obelisk erected by Usertasen I. (about B.C. 3000). All we can say is, that the Delta had no existence when the Nile M'as still fed by a number
of tributaries, and flowed at a much higher level than it does at
present.
^ Many of the neolithic flints belong worked flints discovered by Gen. Pitlto the historical age. Those found at Rivers in the breccia on the north side Gizeh for example, are associated vdth of the temple of Kurnah must be of Roman remains, while the flint weapons great antiquity. See his and Mr. in the neighbourhood of the Roman R. P. Greg's papers on the subject mud -brick fortress at Sheykh Gebel in the Journal of the An^ivpological Embirak were probably the work of Institute, x. 4, xi. 4 (May 1881, May the wild tribes who destroyed it The 1882).



. EGYPT. 309
In some places the river has left behind it evidence of its former level. Thus, at Abu-Simbel, a line of water-worn caves on either bank,
just above the heads of the sitting figures of the great rock-cut temple,
proves the depth of the channel it has scooped out for itself; while we can actually determine the date at which the First Cataract was removed from Gebel Silsileh, or Silsilis, to Assuan ( SySne), and the
highest rise of the river in Ethiopia was 27 feet 3 inches above its
rise at the present day. Certain inscriptions of the reign of Amen
em-hat III. of the twelfth dynasty, and of the fourth king of the thirteenth dynasty, found at Semneh (about thirty miles south of the Second Cataract), show that this was the level to which the inundation
then reached, and that the plains of Ethiopia, which are now far above
the fertilising reach of the river, Avere then annually inundated. Before
the accession of the eighteenth dynasty, however, the catastrophe had
happened ; the Nile forsook its old channel, still very visible, to the south-east of Assuan, the First Cataract was formed, and the highest
level of the inundation above it was that attained at present. The earliest traces of man in Egypt since the country assumed its modern features are probably to be found in the stone implements already mentioned. There is no evidence to show that Egyptian civilisation was introduced from abroad ; on the contrary, everything seems to point to its having been of indigenous growth. And the high perfection it had reached before the date of the earliest monuments witli which we are acquainted implies unnumbered ages of
previous development. The civilisations of the ancient world — of
Egypt, of China, and of Babylonia—were all the creations of great
rivers. Every attempt hitherto made to discover a primitive connection between them has failed.
Bace. —The racial affinity of the ancient Egyptians is still an open
question. It is certain, however, that after the age of the Old Empire the dominant race ceased to be pure. Thus, the Pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty seem to have had Nubian blood in their veins, the Phoenicians of the Delta have left descendants in the natives of Lake Menzaleh, and the long dominion of the Hyksos cannot but have affected the population of the country. Even the conquering princes
of the eighteenth dynasty married foreign wives and peopled Egypt
with foreign captives, the twenty-fifth dynasty came from Ethiopia,
and the Saites of the twenty -sixth were probably of Semitic, or, as
Brugsch is inclined to think, of Libyan origin. At all events they
introduced a new element, the Greek, into the population of Egypt.



310 APPENDIX L
The type of features presented by the monuments of the Old Empire is essentially different jfrom that presented by the monuments of a
later period; and while Egjrptian skulls earlier than the sixth dynasty
are dolichocephalic, those subsequent to the close of the Old Empire are brachycephalic. The physiological type of the Egyptian of the
Old Empire — of the founders, that is, of Egyptian art and civilisa
tion — is that of a somewhat short, thick-set man, with massive, goodtempered mouth, smooth hair, full nostrils, broad forehead, and reddish
brown complexion. He belongs to what ethnologists have vaguely termed the Caucasian or Mediterranean stock. Up to the last the Egyptian showed no resemblance whatsoever to the negro, and the
ooloar of his skin alone woiild effectually mark him off from the
Nubian. On the other hand, the monuments draw a careful distinction between him and the Libyans, who are painted white or pale yellow.
Language casts no li^t on the question, since linguistic relationship proves nothing more than that races speaking allied forms of speech
were once in social contact with one another. Moreover, the philo
logical position of the Old Egyptian language presents many diflSculties, though it seems probable that either it or its parent-speech was the sister of the parent-speech of the modern Libyan, Haussa, and Galla
dialects on the one side, and of the parent-speech of the Semitic idioms
on the other. We may, if we like, class the 'Egyptians and their language as " Hamitic," but nothing is thereby explained. In fact, so fitf- as our present materials and knowledge are concerned, the Egyptians
were as autochthonous and isolated as their own civilisation.
Gtography. — Egypt naturally falls into two divisions : the Delta,
f(Hmed by the mouths of the Nile, in the north ; and the land fertilised
by the Nile, between the Delta and the First Cataract, in the south. Below Syene and the First Cataract we are in Nubia. At the apex of the triangle formed by the Delta stood Memphis, built by Menes upon the ground he had reclaimed from the Nile by constructing a
dyke, —that of Kosheish,—the remains of which may still be detected near Mitrahenny, and so confining the river to its western channel Older than Memphis was Tini or This, the birthplace of Menes, and in after times a mere suburb of the younger Abydos. Here was the tomb of Osiris, in the nei^bourhood of which every Egyptian of suflBcient wealth and dignity desired to be buried- The accumulated graves formed the huge mound now known as the Kom es-Sultin. About one hundred miles southwards of This and Abydos stood Thebes, which under the Middle Iknpire became the metropolis of Egypt, and



EGYPT. 311
attained its chief glory under the kings of the eighteenth and nineteenth
J^-nasties. It is doubtful whether even a village stood on the spot
in the time of the Old Empire ; indeed, it is possible that the popu
lation of the district at that eariy epoch was still mainly Nubian. Subsequently, the town extended from the east to the west bank, where the temple and palace of Ramses III. (now Medinet Abu), the
Memnonium or Ramessenm,—^perhaps the tomb of Ramses IL,— and
the temples built by Seti L at Kum^ by Queen Hatasu at Deir
el-Bahri, and by Amenophis IIL futher south, rose at the foot of
the vast necropolis of the city. In the classical era Thebes gave its name to the southern half of Egypt. In the extreme south, on the Egyptian side of the First Cataract, was Suan or Syen^, now Assuan, opposite to the island of Elephantine, called Ab, " the elephant " isle, by the Egj^ptians, from which came the sixth dynasty. Two small islands southward of Elephantine acquired the reputation of sanctity
at least as early as the twelfth and thirteenth djmasties, and one of them, Senem, now Bigeh-Konosso, in the fourth and third centuries RC, communicated its sanctity to the neighbouring island of Phike. Philae soon became the religious centre of Egjpt, the reputed tomb of Osiris having been transferred to it after the decay of Abydos. The
granite cHffs and boulders between Philae and SyenS furnished the
material for the obelisks, the sphinxes, the colossi, and the other great monuments of the Egyptian monarchs ; and the early date at which they were worked may be gathered from the fact that the so-called granite -temple, close to the Sphinx of Gizeh, whose building may have preceded the reign of !Menes, is constructed of blocks which must iiave been brought from Assuan. Southward of the First Cataract was Nubia, and above that again Cosh or Ethiopia. Nubia formed part of the kingdom of the sixth dynasty, while Usertasen IIL fixed the boundaries of the empire at Semneh and Kummeh ; and an Egyptian oflScer, entitled " the Prince of Kush," and first named in inscriptions of Thothmes L, whose capital was as far south as Napata, governed the country up to the age of the twenty-first destiny. The most perfect remains of Pharaonic fortifications now existing are the fortresses of sun-dried brick erected by Thothmes III. at Kobban, opposite Dakkeh, and on both sides of the river at Semneh, thirty-five miles south of the Second Cataract The division of Egypt into Upper and Lower dates from the age preceding Menes, the first known king, who united the two kingdoms
(B.a 5004). Lower Egypt, called To 3Ieh or To Mera—" the northern



312 APPENDIX L
country " — extended from the Mediterranean to Beni-Suef, and consequently included the marshes of the Delta, occupied in the time of the Old Empire by the long-forgotten hippopotamus, crocodile, and papyrus. It was defended from the attacks of the Amu or Semitic
tribes of Western Asia by a line of fortresses called Matsor in Hebrew
(whence Mizraim, or " the two matsors,"—that is, Upper and Lower Egypt). The line stretched from Migdol in the north to the
neighbourhood of Suez in the south, and was originally established by the founders of the eighteenth dynasty. The main channels through
which the Nile flowed into the sea were seven, —the Pelusiac, Tanitic,
Mendesian, Bukolic or Phatnitic, Sebennytic, Bolbitinic, and Kanopic,

of which two only are now navigable. The Kanopic branch, ten miles from the mouth of which Alexandria was founded under the auspices of Alexander the Great, is now represented by a marshy inlet near Abukir. In the eastern part of the Delta lay the land of
Goshen, with its cities of Tanis or Zoan, Bubastis, Pharbsethus, Pithom,
and On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), not far from which was the site
now known as the Tel el-Yehudlyeh, where the Jewish priest Onias, with the aid of Ptolemy Philom^t6r, raised the rival temple to that of Jerusalem. From Tanis and Daphnse to Pelusium the fortified highroad led from Egypt to Palestine, along the edge of the Mediterranean. Upper Egypt, extending from Beni-Suef to Assuan, was known as To
Kem4, or To Res, —" the southern country,"—which, with the article pa prefixed, is the original of the Hebrew and Greek Pathros. Like Lower Egypt, it was divided into nomes or districts,

hesoph in
Egyptian,—supposed to represent the numerous small states of the prehistoric age out of which the historic Egypt was constituted. Each
nome was subdivided into its nut or capital, its uu or cultivated land,
fertilised by the Nile, the marsh lands (pehu), and the portion of culti
vated land watered by canals. The civil and military administration of the nome was in the hands either of a hereditary governor (hik), or of a nomarch (mer-ntit-zdt-to), appointed by the king. Under the
Ptolemies these monarchs were usually termed (rrpaTtjyoC, presided
over by an eTriorpaTTjyds ; the religious affairs of the province being
managed by the high -priests of the principal temples, assisted by
a numerous staff of prophets, scribes, astrologers, and sacristans. At the same time the nome was further subdivided into a certain number
of Toirapxiai, composed of groups of towns (tottoi) and villages.
The number of nomes varied at different periods. Thus the hiero
glyphic list at Edfu mentions thirty -nine, nineteen being in Lower

EGYPT. 315
Chronology and History. —Egyptian chronology is full of difficulties,
and without more materials than we possess at present can be little else than a system of guess-work. We must be content to date the period preceding the seventh century B.C. by dynasties rather than by
years. All we can state with certainty is that the chronology,
historically considered, is an enormously long one, and that the earlier
dynasties must be placed at least 6000 years ago. Our authorities are partly classical, partly monumental. The most important is Manetho
(in Egyptian Mel en-Tahuti — "Beloved of Thoth "), a priest of Sebennytos, who was intrusted by Ptolemy Philadelphus (B.C. 284
246) with the task of translating into Greek the historical works contained in the Egyptian temples. Unfortunately Manetho's work is lost, and we have to depend for our knowledge of it upon the meagre and sometimes contradictory extracts made by Josephus, Eusebius, Julius Africanus,^ and George Syncellus.^ Eusebius and Africanus profess to give us Manetho's list of the Egyptian dynasties, with the length of time each lasted, and in many cases the names and regnal years of the monarchs of whom they were composed. The names and numbers, however, do not always correspond, nor does even the duration of certain dynasties agree with the totals of the reigns comprised in them, when added together. But
what is most serious is, that the names of the kings, and the length of
time they are said to have reigned, are not unfrequently irreconcilable with the statements of the monuments. Sometimes, too, reigns for which we have monumental evidence are omitted altogether. It is plain, therefore, that Manetho's list has come to us in a very corrupt
condition, and that the numbers contained in it must be received with extreme caution. Moreover, the Christian writers who have handed them down were intent on reconciling the chronology of the Eg3rptian historian with that of the Old Testament, and were conse
quently likely to curtail it as much as possible. Nevertheless, in the
want of other authorities, all attempts to restore Egyptian chronology
must be based upon this imperfect reproduction of Manetho, to whom, it may be observed, the distribution of the kings into dynasties is due.

ments—or rather, perhaps, of the native histories compiled from them

has been abundantly proved by the deciplierment of the inscriptions. His statements, notwithstanding the imperfect state in which they have reached us, are in the main correct. The monumental names can generally be detected under their Greek disguises, the scheme of dynasties has received full confirmation, and the chronology of the Sebennytic priest seems rather to err on the side of defect than
of excess. Startled by the long chronology Manetho's list necessitates,
Egyptian scholars formerly imagined that several of the dynasties were contemporaneous. M. Mariette's researches, however, have shown that this is not the case. Thus the theory which made the fifth dynasty reign at Elephantine, while the sixth was reigning at Memphis, has been overthrown by the discovery of monuments belonging to the two dynasties in both places ; and the discovery of the
colossi of the thirteenth Theban dynasty at S4n or Tanis, near Xois, upsets the scheme according to which this dynasty was contemporane
ous with the Xoites of the fourteenth. In fact, as M. Mariette says,
if the lists of Manetho " contain collateral dynasties, we should find in
them, before or after the twenty-first, the dynasty of high-priests which
(as we learn from the monuments) reigned at Thebes, while the twentyfirst occupied Tanis; in the same way we should have to reckon before or after the twenty-third the seven or eight independent kings who were contemporary with it, and who ought, if Manetho had not disregarded them, to have added so many successive royal families to the list of the Egyptian priest ; similarly the * dodecarchy ' would
count, at least, as one d3Tiasty coming between the twenty-fifth and
the twenty-sixth ; and finally, the Theban princes, the rivals of the
Shepherds, would take their place before or after the seventeenth."*
There were several periods in the history of Egypt, it is true, when more
than one line of kings was ruling in the country ; but it is clear that
either Manetho or his epitomisers struck out all except the one line which was considered legitimate, and so drew up a catalogue of
successive dynasties. It is probable, however, that gaps occur between some of the latter. If at any period there was no dynasty which the Egyptian
priests considered legitimate, it would necessarily be passed over in the
annals of Manetho. Indeed, of one such period we have actual proof. No mention is made by Manetho of the so-called dodecarchy, when,

for more than twenty years, Egypt was under the domination of Assyria. The twenty-sixth dynasty is made to follow immediately
upon the twenty-fifth. And there is no reason to think that this is
an isolated case. The interval of 750 years, for instance, which,
according to Africanus, intervened between the close of the Old Empire with the sixth dynasty, and the rise of the Middle Empire with the eleventh, seems hardly sufficient to account for the changes imdergone by Egypt and its people during the time, and the interval is still further reduced to 391 or 466 years by Eusebius.
Reigns, too, have dropped out of the list in many places ; thus, to take only the earlier dynasties, Noferkara or Nebkara is omitted in
the third ; Ratat-ef, the successor of Kheops, in the fourth ; and Keka in the fifth. The efforts of Eusebius to shorten the chronology make his excerpts less trustworthy than those of Africanus ; Kheneres, for
instance, the Tefa or Hutefa of the tablet of Sakk3,rah, is omitted by him at the end of the second dynasty (though he makes Nepherkheres or Noferkafra the seventh and not the fifth successor of Binothris or Bainuter), and an example of the way in which he reduces the number
of regnal years has already been noticed. In commemorating the earlier monarchs of the country the priests
of the various temples compiled selected lists of them. Thus at
Abydos Seti I. is represented as honouring the spirits of sixty-five of his predecessors, beginning with Menes and ending with the last king of the twelfth dynasty, the kings of the eighteenth dynasty, who are made
to follow immediately, being reckoned as twelve. At Kamak, again, Thothmes III. is pictured making offerings to the images of sixty-one
of his predecessors ; while a second list of kings, discovered at Abydos, in the temple of Ramses II., repeats the list given by Seti, with a few
omissions. At Sakk^rah, too, in the tomb of a priest named Tunari, who flourished under Ramses XL, we see the dead man admitted to
eternal life in the presence of fifty-eight of the earlier kings of Egypt.
The principles upon which these selected lists were drawn up are still unknown to us. Certain prominent kings, such as Menes, the founder of the empire, or Kheops, the builder of the great pyramid, occur in
them all, but in other parts of the lists the names chosen are different
Possibly the priests selected those monarchs who were reputed to have been benefactors to the particular shrines in which the lists are found
;
more probably the deceased is brought into spiritual relation with those who in some special way were supposed to have been his
ancestors. At all events, it is one of these selected temple-lists that is

embodied in the catalogue of thirty-eight "Theban" kings extracted from the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes (b.c. 276-194) by Christian writers. The introductory sentence, which calls Menes a Theban, shows plainly the source from which it was derived. ^ A sketch of Egyptian history is given by Diod6ros, who probably derived it from Ephoros. The sketch is on the whole fairly accurate, though the blunder of Herodotos is repeated, which placed Kheops, Khephren, and Mykerinos 2000 years too late. Herodotos (see Introd.)
derived his information as to earlier Egyptian history from the
inventive ignorance of half-caste ciceroni, so that we need not wonder
at its utter incompatibility with the truth. In saying, however, that the 341 generations of kings who preceded Sethos extended over 11,340 years, the Greek historian has made a gratuitous mistake of his own ; not only is his arithmetic at fault, but he has confounded
together reigns and generations. It is possible that the sources from which Manetho composed his history may yet be recovered. What they were we may gather from the famous Turin papyrus, written in the time of Ramses II., and
found probably in a tomb at Thebes. The carelessness of the natives who discovered it, and of the Europeans who brought it home, has unfortunately shivered it into more than 160 minute fragments, many
of which it is impossible to put in their right places. In spite of this
horribly mutilated condition, the papyrus is nevertheless of the highest
value. A considerable number of royal names are preserved, many of them otherwise unknown, as well as the years and months each king reigned. With a complete papyrus of this kind we should be
able to restore the whole skeleton of Egyptian history.
Like the histories of all other great nations, this history begins
with its mythical age. The first dynasty of prehistoric Egypt was
believed to have consisted of the gods. Each temple had its own
peculiar list of these divine monarchs, in which its presiding deity took the first place. Thus at Memphis the dynasty of gods was com
posed as follows: — (1) Ptah or Hephaestos, "the father of the
gods ; " (2) Ra, the Sun-god, his son ; (3) Shu (Agathodsemon), the
Air-god, his son ; (4) Seb, the earth, his son ; (5) Osiris, his son
;
(6) Set (Typhon), the son of Seb ; (7) Horos, " the redeemer," the son
of Osiris. At Thebes, on the other hand, the order was :—(1) Amun
Ra, " the king of the gods ; " (2) Mont, his son ; (3) Shu, the son of
• The list of Eratosthenes, in which of the royal names, was edited by Apolan attempt is made to give the meaning loddros of Athens (about B.c. 1 40).



EGYPT. 319
Ra ; (4) Seb, his son ; (5) Osiris, his son ; (6) Horos, his son ; Set,
the evil principle, not being reckoned among the legitimate rulers.
Next to these royal gods came the Hor-shesu, or " successors of Horos," divided by Manetho into the two dynasties of demigods and Manes ; among the latter, according to the Turin papyrus, being the sacred animals, the Apis of Memphis and the Mn^vis of On. The reign of the Manes closed the mythical age of Egypt ; they were followed by Menes of This, the founder of the united monarchy and the leader of
the historical dynasties. Modern research, however, has caught glimpses of the epoch which preceded the age of Menes, and was relegated by the Egyptian scribes to the reigns of the mysterious Hor-shesu. The country of the Nile was then divided into a number of small kingdoms, inhabited by a race similar in origin and customs, and already possessed of a consider
able civilisation. The so-called granite temple, near the Sphinx of
Gizeh, built of huge monoliths of Syenite granite, exquisitely cut and
polished and fitted together, perhaps belongs to this remote period. It must have originally been a tomb, but when it was discovered in the sand in the time of Kheops, the builder of the great pyramid, the
king seems to have imagined it to be the shrine of Harmachis,^ the Sphinx. The building carries us back to an age when neither cement nor sculpture nor writing was known ; but even at that remote date the principles of architecture had been studied, and the chieftain who lived on the edge of the Delta was able to have huge blocks of granite cut and transported for him from the distant quarries of Assuan. The Sphinx itself probably belongs to the same early time. At all
event* it was already in existence in the age of Khephren and the
fourth dynasty, and no mention is made of its construction in the excerpts from Manetho. Whoever has seen the rich plain in which the city of This once stood will easily understand how it was that the founder of the united
monarchy came from thence. The plain is at once one of the largest
and most fertile of those in the valley of the Nile, while it is pro
tected from attack on three sides by the Libyan hills, and on the
fourth side by the river. Everything was in favour of the progress of its inhabitants in wealth and power. At any rate it was from here,

from the precincts of the tomb of Osiris himself, that Menes or Mena, " the constant," made his way northwards, passing on his road the ancient kingdoms of Ni ent-Ba^ (Antseopolis) and Sesunnu (Hermopolis), where Horus had defeated and slain his enemy Set, with the aid of Thoth. At last he established himself in the near neighbour
hood of the Sphinx, which may possibly record his deeds and features, and by means of the great dyke of Kosheish won the land from the Nile whereon to build his capital, Men-nofer or Memphis. The date to which this event was assigned by Manetho has, for reasons already given, been variously computed. Boeckh makes it B.C. 5702, linger 5613, Mariette 6004, Brugsch 4455, Lauth 4157, Pessl 3917, Lepsius 3892, and Bunsen 3623. We shall provisionally adopt the dates of Mariette, whose long
continued excavations in Egypt have given him an exceptional authority to speak upon the matter; but those who have sailed up the Nile, and observed the various phases through which Egyptian art has passed will be inclined to think that he has rather fallen short of the mark than gone beyond it. Menes, we are told, undertook a campaign against the Libyans, and after a reign of sixty-two years was eaten by a crocodile (or hip
popotamus), a legend which may have originated in the belief that Set, the enemy of order and government, revenged himself upon the
successor of the royal Osiris. Teta, who followed him, was said to have written treatises upon medicine and anatomy, and the medical papyrus of Ebers contains a chapter which was supposed to have been
" discovered " in his reign, while the sixty-fourth chapter of the Book of the Dead was ascribed to the same date. The only other noteworthy king of the first dynasty was Uenephes, the builder in all probability of the so-called step-pyramid of Sakk^rah. The second king of the second dynasty, Kakau or Kaiekhos, established or more probably regulated the worship of the bulls Apis and Mnevis, and the goat of Mendes. After him Bainuter or Binothris laid down that women as well as men might henceforward inherit the throne. With the death of the last king of the second dynasty (B.C. 4449) the line of Menes seems to have come to an end. It had succeeded in welding the whole country together, and suppressing those collateral princes whose names are occasionally met with on the monuments. The third dynasty was Memphite. To it belongs Snefru or Sepliuris (B.C. 4290-4260), whose inscriptions in the Wady Magharah tell us that the turquoise-mines of Sinai were worked for his benefit, and



EGYPT. 321
guarded by Egyptian soldiers. The lofty pyramid of Meidlim is his
tomb, close to wliich are the sepulchres of his princes and officials,
still brilliant with coloured mosaic-work of pictures and hieroglyphics.
But it is the era of the fourth dynasty that is emphatically the building era. The pyramid-tombs of Khufu (Kheops), Khafra (Khephren), and Men-ka-ra (Mykerinos or Menkheres), in the necropolis of Memphis,
still excite the astonishment of mankind by their size and solidity. " The great pyramid " of Gizeh, with its two companions, towers like a mountain above the sandy plain, and neither the ruin of six thousand years nor the builders of Cairo have been able to destroy them. Khufu and Khafra, whose impiety was one of the ** travellers' tales " told to Herodotos by his ignorant guides, were separated from each
other by the reign of Tat-ef-Ra or Ra-tatf, who was possibly the son of
Khufu, " the long-haired," and the brother of Khafra. The statue of Khafra, of hard diorite, found by M. Mariette, and preserved in the
Museum of B(ilak, is one of the most beautiful and realistic specimens
of Egyptian art, characteristic of its early phase, and illustrating the features of the Egyptians of the Old Empire. Men-ka-ra was followed by Ases-ka-f, the Asykhis of Herodotos, who built the pyramid of brick, and was, according to Diodoros, one of the five great lawgivers of Egypt After a few more reigns, the fifth dynasty succeeds to the fourth, and we pass to the age of Ti, whose tomb at Sakkdrah is among the choicest of Egyptian monuments. Its walls of alabaster are
covered with delicate sculptures, brilliantly coloured, and resembling
the most exquisite embroidery on stone. They trace for us the scenes
of Ti's life ; here he is superintending his labourers in the field ; here he
is watcliing a party of carpenters or shipbuilders; here, again, he is hunting hippopotami among the papyri of the Delta, while a kingfisher hard-by is seeking, with loud cries and outstretched wings, to drive a crocodile from her young. The kings of the fifth dynasty introduced the fashion of adding a second cartouche, with the name of honour, to that which contains their names as individuals. One of them, Tat-ka-ra Assa, who has left us monuments among the mines of Sinai, was the prince under whom the Papyrus Prisse was written by "the governor Ptah-Hotep." This, the most ancient book in the world, is a treatise on practical philosophy, very like the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. Thus, it tells us, that *' if thou art become great after thou hast been lowly, and if thou hast heaped up riches after poverty, being because of that the chiefest in thy city ; if
thou art known for thy wealth and art become a great lord ;—let not Y



322 APPENDIX I.
thy heart be puffed up because of thy riches, for it is God who has given them unto thee. Despise not another who is as thou wast ; be towards him as towards thy equal" Ptah-Hotep must have been advanced in years at the time he wrote his book, if we may judge
from the feeling language in which he describes old age. With the fifth dynasty the Memphite dynasties come to an end. The sixth was from Elephantine. Its most illustrious monarch was Merira Pepi I., whose able minister Una has left us a record of his
widespread activity. Ships of war were built at the First Cataract to convey blocks of granite to the north ; multitudes of negroes were enrolled in the Egyptian army for campaigns against the Semites of Asia and the Herusha or Beduins of the isthmus of Suez ; the garrisons in the Sinaitic peninsula were strengthened ; and the temple of Hathor, at Denderah, built by the Horshesu in the mythical age, and repaired by Khufu, was rebuilt from the foundations according to
the original plans, which had been accidentally discovered.^ The sixth dynasty ended with Queen Neit-akrit, or Nitokris, " with the rosy cheeks," who completed the third pyramid, left unfinished by Men-ka-ra, and, if we may believe Herodotos, avenged herself on the
murderers of her brother. An age of trouble and disaster, it would seem, followed upon her deatk The copyists of Manetho give but a short duration to the seventh dynasty, and the three kings placed
after Neit-akrit by the Turin papyrus are made to reign severally only two years a month and a day, four years two months and a day, and two years a month and a day. With the close of the sixth dynasty (b.C. 3500) we may also date
the close of the Old Empira For several centuries the history of
Egypt is a blank. A few royal names are met with on scarabs, or in the tablets of Abydos and SakkSrah, but their tombs and temples have not yet been found. When the darkness that envelops them is cleared away, it is with the rise of the eleventh d}Tiasty and the Middle Empire (B.C. 3064). How long it lasted we do not know, but the period cannot have been a short one. Profound changes have taken place when the veil is once more lifted from Egyptian history.
We find ourselves in a new Egypt; the seat of power has been
transferred to Thebes, the physical type of the ruling caste is no longer that of the Old Empire, and a change has pa.ssed over the

EGYPT. 323
religion of the people. It has become gloomy, introspective, and
mystical ; the light - hearted freedom and practical character that formerly distinguished it are gone. Art, too, has undergone modifications which imply a long age of development. It has ceased to be spontaneous and realistic, and has become conventional. Even the fauna and flora are different, and the domestic cat, imported from Nubia, for the first time makes its appearance on the threshold of
history. Thebes is the capital of the Middle Empire, and a new deity, Amun, the god of Thebes, presides over it Its princes were long the
vassals of the legitimate dynasties of Herakleopolis, and the first of whom we know, Entef I., claimed to be no more than a simple noble. His son, Mentu-hotep I., still calls himself hor, or subordinate king,
and it is not until three generations afterwards that Entef IV. throws off" the supremacy of the sovereigns in the north, assumes the title of monarch of Upper and Lower Egypt, and founds the eleventh dynasty
;
though this honour is also claimed by Mentu-hotep IV. The era of Theban greatness, however, begins with the Amen - em - hats and Usertasens of the twelfth dynasty. Its founder, Amen-em-hat I., won
the throne by war, and followed the fashion of the old Memphite kings by building for himself a pyramid. We possess in the Sallier papyrus the instructions which he wrote for his son. The relations between
Egypt and the adjoining districts of Palestine are revealed to us in the story of an adventurer named Saneha, who is made to fly from the court of the Theban monarch to that of Ammu-enshi, king of Tennu in Edom, where, like David, the Egyptian killed a " champion " famous
for his strength and size. The obelisk which marks the site of
Heliopolis, near Cairo, was raised by Usertasen I., the son and successor of Amen-em-hat; it is the oldest of which we know. It characterises the Middle Empire, just as the pyramid characterised the Old Einpire, and, in the later times at all events, was intended to serve as a lightning-conductor. At any rate, an inscription at Edfu speaks of it as thus employed. Meanwhile, new colonists were sent to Sinai, and the turquoise -mines were re -opened. The Nubians and negroes of Aken and Kush were conquered, and in the eighth year of the reign of Usertasen III. the southern boundary of the empire was fixed at the fortresses of Semneh and Kummeh, thirtyfive miles beyond the Second Cataract, no negro being allowed to come northward of them, except for purposes of trade. Here, in succeeding reigns, the height of the inundation was marked year by year on the



324 APPENDIX I.
rocks, from which we learn that its highest rise was 27 feet 3 inches
above its rise at the present day. The enormous basin, with its tunnel and canal, dug by Amen-em-hat III. on the western bank of the Nile, created the modem province of the Fayfim. Its name, Meri, or "lake," was changed by the Greeks into the name of an
imaginary being, Moeris. Its site is now marked by a depression in
the south-east of the Fayftm. Strangely enough, the province and its inhabitants were so abhorred by the Egyptians on account of their
worship of the god Sebek, and his sacred animal, the crocodile, that they are never mentioned on the monuments. It is possible that Amen-em-hat peopled the district with the captives he had carried away from the south. We know from the paintings on the tomb of Prince Khnum-hotep at Beni-hassan that the immigration of the Semites into the Delta, which eventually gave it the name of Keft-ur,
or Caphtor, " Greater Phoenicia," had already begun in the reign of
Usertasen II. In the sixth year of the latter's reign a family of
thirty-seven Amu or Semites from Absha arrived with their asses and goods, and craved permission to settle on the banks of the Nile. We
may still see them with their black hair and hooked noses, and Phoenician garments of many colours like the one which Joseph wore. They were the forerunners of numerous hordes, who succeeded at last not only in making the Delta their own, but even in conquering the whole country that had given them hospitality, and under the name of the Hyksos ruling over it for more than 500 years. They borrowed the alphabet of the Egyptians, under the form assumed by it in the hieratic
papyri of the Middle Empire ; and this alphabet, after being carried to
Phoenicia, has become the mother of the alphabets of the civilised world. The kings of the thirteenth dynasty ably maintained the empire which had been handed down to them. More than 150 are named in the Turin papyrus, proving that the number 60, given by the copyists of Manetho, is incorrect. Monuments of some of them have been found at Asyut, at Abydos, at Bubastis, at Tanis, and elsewhere. The
twenty-sixth sovereign of them erected colossi in the island of Argo, in the very heart of Ethiopia, thus penetrating far beyond the southern
most limits of the conquests of the twelfth dynasty. But the following
dynasty from Xois (Sakha), whose seventy-six kings, according to Manetho, reigned for 484 or 134 years, allowed the power it inherited to slip through its hands. The fifteenth dynasty bears the ominous
title of Shepherds, or Hyksos, and testifies to the fact that Egypt had
passed under the yoke of a foreign domination.



EGYPT. 325
Hyksos is tho Egyptian hik-shasu, "chief of the Beduins," or " Shepherds," Shasu being the name given to the Semitic nomades of North-western Arabia. The Hyksos, however, are called Men or
Menti in the inscriptions, Menti being explained in the geographical
table of Edfu to be the natives of Syria. In accordance with this, Manetho speaks of Jerusalem as a Hyksos town, and their Egyptian capital, Zoan or Tanis, is connected with Hebron in Numb. xiii.
22. It is possible that their leaders were Hittite princes, though Lepsius believes them to have come from Punt or Southern Arabia ; at any rate, their features, as revealed by the few memorials of them
that exist, more especially the lion of S^n, belong to a very peculiar
and non-Semitic type.^ But their monuments are rare ; after their expulsion the Egyptians did their utmost to destroy all that reminded them of the hated strangers, and it is only within the last few years that M. Mariette's excavations at San or Tanis have brought to light some scanty relics of the Shepherd kings. Their rule lasted, according to Manetho, for 511 years,^ and this seems to be confirmed by a granite slab found at S&n, of the time of
^ M. Maspero has lately questioned whether the peculiar type represented by the monuments of San is really that of the Hyksos, and not rather of the original population of the district. * This number is obtained from the valuable fragment of Manetho preserved by Josephus {Cont. Ap. i. 14, 15). Africanu^ and Eusebius are hopelessly confused. Africanus makes the fifteenth dynasty consist of six " Phoenician
"
kings, reigning in all 284 years ; but the number of years assigned to each does not always agree with that given by Josephus, and the leader of the dynasty, Salatis, is confounded with Saites, the leader of the seventeenth. Africanus further makes the sixteenth d3raasty consist of thirty-two "Greek" Shepherd kings and last 518 years, the seventeenth dynasty consisting of forty-three Shepherd kings for 151 years. Eusebius, on the other hand, passes over two of the Shepherd dynasties, and, doubtless following the example of Manetho, reckons the contemporary native princes at Thebes as alone legitimate. His
fifteenth dynasty consequently consists of Thebans for 250 years, and his sixteenth dynasty also of five Thebans for 190 years. In the seventeenth dynasty he enumerates four Phoenician Shepherd kings for 103 years, though forty-three independent sovereigns had time meanwhile to reign at Thebes. While, therefore, according to Africanus, the Shepherds occupied the country for 953 years, according to Eusebius the contemporary Theban dynasties extended over only 543 years (or, supposing the seventeenth dynasty to be contemporary with the latter, only 440 years). The numbers are plainly exaggerated, and the round numbers in Eusebius suspicious ; but it is probable that the Theban princes did not recover their independence until some time after the Hyksos conquest, so that it was only during tho reigns of the later Shepherd kings that Manetho was able to reckon the Theban dynasties as collateral. The seventeenth Shepherd dynasty is distinguished on the monuments from tho two preceding ones by the name of Menti-Petti.



320 APPENDIX I.
Eamses II., which is dated in the 400th year of the (Hyksos) king,
Set-aa-pehti Nubti,—if, that is, the latter can be identified with the Saites who leads the seventeenth dynasty of Manetho (b.C. 180G).^ It must, however, be admitted that Set was specially the god of the Shepherds, and that his name enters into the composition of several of
theirs (such as Staan, Asseth, and Sethos). Some time appears to have elapsed before the Semitic hordes consolidated themselves under the
rule of a single prince, to whom the name of Salatis or Shaladh, " the
Sultan," is given, and who established his court at Memphis. Like the Moors in Spain, the Hyksos seem never to have succeeded in
reducing the whole of Egypt to subjection, though the few native princes who managed to maintain themselves in the south were no doubt tributary to the earlier Shepherd monarchs ; and Wiedemann's discovery that the granite statue (A) in the Louvre, which was usurped by Amenophis III., is really a monument of the Hyksos prince Apepi,
proves that the latter subjected to his sway thirty-six districts of Nubia. Gradually, however, the power of the Hyksos became weaker, the tributary princes made themselves independent, and the hik or governor of Thebes collected around him a rival court. Meanwhile the Hyksos kings had fully submitted themselves to the influence of Egyptian civilisation. They had adopted the manners and customs, the art and literature, even the religion and the gods, of their conquered
subjects. They gave themselves the titles of their predecessors, and raised temples and sphinxes in honour of the deities of Egypt. Zoan or Tanis was made their capital and adorned with splendid buildings, so that its foundation could well be ascribed to them. Here they surrounded themselves with the scribes and savans of both Egypt and Asia, and a geometrical papyrus written under their patronage has
survived to tell us of the culture they professed. Their hold upon
the country was confirmed by the construction of two fortresses at
Ha-uar or Avaris, in the Sethroite nome, and Sherohan ^ on the frontier,
the first of which was garrisoned with 240,000 men ; but their direct power does not seem to have extended further south than the Faydm. It was during the domination of one of the three Hyksos dynasties that first Abraham and then Joseph must have entered Egj'pt, and found a ready welcome among a people of kindred race. But the rule of the Shepherds was drawing to a close. Their
' Maspcro, however, holds that the like the year 363 of Harmakliis men date merely refers to the 400th year of tioned at Edfu. the mythical reign of Set or Tjrphon, * Sharuhen in Josh. xix. 6.



EGYPT. 327
monarch Apepi or Apophis, as we learn from the legend in the Sallier
papyrus, had deserted Tanis and established his capital at Avaris,
•
an indication, perhaps, that the limits of Hyksos authority had been gradually contracting. Nevertheless, he still claimed supremacy over the subordinate native princes of the south, and in an evil day deter
mined to displace Ra-skenen, the hik or governor of Thebes. Raskenen submitted to his first demand that he should worship no other gods but Amun-Ra ; but when the tyrant sent a still more exacting message, Ra-skenen ventured to raise the standard of revolt, and summoned the other oppressed chieftains of Egypt to his aid. The war of independence was begun, the foreigners were driven from one position to another, and a national fleet was built by Ra-skenen Taa II., whose three successors, Ra-skenen III., Kames,^ and Aahmes, concluded the work. Avaris was captured in the fifth year of the last-named prince and Sherohan in the sixth, and Egypt was now free. Aahmes founded the eighteenth dynasty and the new empire (B.C. 1703), and with it a new era of prosperity and glory for the country of his
ancestors.
The same outburst of vigour and military activity that followed
the expulsion of the Moors from Spain followed also the expulsion of the Hyksos. The injuries Egypt had endured at the hands of Asia were avenged upon Asia itself. The old policy of exclusiveness and
non-interference in Asiatic affairs was renounced, the war was carried into the East, and the boundaries of the empire were laid on the banks of the Euphrates. Palestine was occupied by Egyptian garrisons, and
in thus flinging herself upon Asia, Egypt became an Asiatic power. The penalty was paid by a future generation. Asiatic customs and
aspirations penetrated into the kingdom of the Pharaohs, the popula
tion and the court itself became semi-Asiatic, and, exhausted by the
efforts it had made, Egypt at last fell a prey to internal dissensions
and the assaults of foreign enemies.
But for a time, under the great monarchs of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, the brilliant policy they had inaugurated seemed eminently successful Time after time their armies marched out of "hundred -gated Thebes," returning with new rolls of conquered
provinces, with the plunder and tribute of the East, and with trains of
captives for the erection of the gigantic monuments in which the

spirit of the conquerors sought expression. The city -like ruin of Karnak, with its obelisks and columns and carvings, the huge monoliths of granite that watched over the plain of Thebes, the temple of Abu-Simbel, hewn out of a mountain and guarded by colossi, whose countenances betokened the divine calm of undisputed majesty, were all so many memorials of titanic conceptions and more than human pride. Nobler and better than these, however, were the earlier monuments of a Thothmes or a Hatasu, in which Egyptian art gave
utterance to its renaissance in delicately-finished and brilliantly-painted
sculpture on stone. The little temple of Amada in Nubia, built by
Thothmes III. in honour of his young wife, or the ruined walls of Queen Hatasu's temple at Deir el-Bahri, on which is carved the story
of Egyptian exploration in the land of Punt, are, in the artist's eyes, worth far more than the colossal monuments of Ramses 11. The first care of Aahmes or Amosis, after driving out the foreigner, was to unite Egypt again into a single monarchy. Gradually the petty kings were reduced to the rank of feudal princes, and the defeat
of the Nubian sovereign Teta placed the country between the Cataracts once more in Egyptian hands. But it was his second successor,
Thothmes I, who was the first of a long line of great conquerors. In the south he added the Soudan to Egypt, and appointed " a governor
of Kush ; " in the east he carried his arms as far as Naharina, or the land of the Orontes. But his achievements were eclipsed by those of his second son, Thothmes III. For a while his elder sister Hatasu ruled as regent with more than masculine energy and ability,
and her little brother was believed in later legend to have fled, like the god Horos, to the marshes of Bute in the north. The
loftiest obelisk in the world was, by her orders, carved out of the granite rocks of Assuan, engraved, floated down the Nile, and set up at Karnak, in the short space of seven months. Stately temples rose at her command, and a voyage of discovery was made to the land of Punt and the African coast near Cape Guardafni, whence the explorers brought back strange plants and stones and animals, among them a chimpanzee. For fifteen years Hatasu ruled supreme. Then the youthful Thothmes,
grown to man's estate, claimed and received a share in the government, and six years later the queen died.
As a military power, as the arbiter of the destinies of the ancient civilised world, Eg3^t reached its zenith under the sway of Thothmes. During his long reign of fifty-three years eleven months and four days, the country was covered with monuments, and became the centre of

trade and intercourse. Countless treasures flowed into it, and Thebes took rank as the capital of the world. A royal botanical and zoological garden was established, stocked with the curious plants and animals the king had brought back with him from his campaigns, among which we may recognise the mama or dom-palm. In the year after his sister's death, he shattered the combined Canaanite forces, under the Hittite king of Kadesh on the Orontes, at Megiddo, where
tlie enemy left behind them, among other spoil, chariots of silver and
gold that had been made in Cyprus. A fortress was built at the foot of Lebanon, near Arados, to secure the new conquests. But it needed fourteen campaigns before Western Asia could be thoroughly subdued, and in the course of these we hear of the Egyptian king hunting elephants near the town of Ni, midway between Carchemish and Kadesh, After this, year by year tribute and taxes of every kind
came in regularly to the Egyptian treasury from the towns of Palestine and Phoenicia, from Cyprus and the Hittites, from Mesopotamia, Assyria, and perhaps even Babylon itself. Kush, too, sent its offering,
and Egyptian officials visited the Soudan ; while Punt—the coasts of
Somali and Southern Arabia—poured its products into the trading
vessels of the Egyptian king. His successors, Amen-hotep or Amenophis II., Thothmes III., and Amenophis III., maintained the empire they had inherited, with occasional raids upon the negroes, for the sake partly of slaves, partly
of the gold found in their country. The two colossi in the plain of Thebes, one of them the miracle-working Memnon of classical days,
are statues of Amenophis III. But the latter sovereign left a legacy of trouble behind him. He seems to have made a mesalliance by marrying a wife neither royal nor Egyptian, named Taia, and their son, Amenophis IV. or Khu-en-Aten, was regarded as an usurper by the priestly aristocracy of Thebes.^ But Amenophis IV. was more than an unlawful" ruler. He was a heretic, acknowledging only the

one God of Light, whom he worshipped, like his mother, under
the symbol of the solar disk (aten), and fanatically intolerant of Amun-Ra and the state-gods of Thebes. Open war soon broke out between him and the priests. By royal edict the sacred names of Amun and Mut were erased from the monuments of Egypt, the
king's own name was changed to Khu-en-Aten— " the splendour of the solar disk ; " and Thebes, the city of Amun, with all its temples and monuments of victory, was left, in order that a new capital might be founded at Tel el-Amarna. Here a magnificent shrine was built to the new divinity of the Pharaoh, not after the venerable model of the
temples of Egypt, but of those of the subject Phoenicians. It would seem that the king had originally intended to plant this in the city of Thebes itself, and that his retirement to his new capital was an enforced flight. Here he surrounded himself by his relations and the
converts to the new doctrines, —one of the latter, Meri-Ra, being made chief prophet of his temple and adorned with a golden chain. His
generals, indeed, continued to gain victories in Syria and Ethiopia, but the upper classes of Egypt were in secret revolt, and the country was
fermenting with the suppressed bitterness of religious hatred. He died leaving seven daughters and no sons, and was followed by two of his
sons-in-law and the master of his horse, whose united reigns hardly
filled up a single generation. Ai, the master of the horse, had married
the foster-mother of Khu-en-Aten, and during his short reign seems to have carried out a vigorous policy. He returned to the orthodox worship of Amun, and was accordingly allowed a place in the royal
burial-ground of Thebes by the priests. But his death was the signal
for fresh dissensions, which were healed only by the accession of Hor
em-hib, the Armais—not Horos—of Manetho (whose list of the kings of the eighteenth dynasty is in the greatest confusion). Hor-em-hib had married the sister-in-law of Khu-en-Aten, He enlarged the great temple of Amun at Thebes, re-conquered Kush, and received tribute from Punt. With him the eighteenth dynasty came to an end^ Ramses (Ramessu) I., the founder of the nineteenth dynasty, came from Lower Egypt, and was probably of Semitic extraction. He

was related—apparently by marriage — to Hor-em-hib, and his short
reign of six years was chiefly signalised by the beginning of the
long struggle with the Kheta or Hittites, now the most powerful people in Western Asia. His son, Seti Menephthah I., or Sethos, the builder of the great hall of columns at Karnak and the principal temple of Abydos, once more restored the waning military fame of Egypt. The incursions of the Beduins into the Delta were mercilessly avenged. Palestine was overrun from one end to the other; the Phoenicians of the Lebanon submitted voluntarily ; Kadesh, " in the land of the Amorites," once the southern stronghold of the Hittites, was captured ; and Mautenur, the Hittite monarch, after several years of conflict, was forced to make alliance with the Egyptian conqueror. A new enemy had meanwhile appeared on the coast in the shape of the Libyans. They, too, however, were defeated, and Thebes was
filled with the spoil of the stranger.^ Such victories were needed to condone the religious failings of the new dynasty, which worshipped the foreign gods of Canaan, at the head of them all Baal-Sutekh, or Set, once the patron-deity of the hated Hyksos, but now the divinity after whom the Egyptian king was himself named. Eamses IL or Sestesura, the Sesostris of the Greeks, son and successor of Seti,
seems to have been a boy of about ten years at his accession, and to have died at the ripe age of eighty. He was the grand monarque of
Egypt. His long reign, his colossal buildings, his incessant wars, and
the victories he claimed, all make him the prototype of Louis Quatorze. For a time he had been associated in the government with his father, whose death was the signal for a renewal of the war between Egypt
and the* Hittites, The Hittites had summoned their allies from the
furthest regions of their empire. The Dardanians (Dardani) came from the Troad, the Masu or Mysians from their cities of Ilion {IlunaY and Pedasos, the Kolkhians or Keshkesh from the Kaukasos, the Syrians from the Orontes, the Phoenicians from Arvad. Kadesh, on the Orontes, was the centre of the war. It was here that Ramses saved himself from an ambush of the enemy, partly perhaps by his personal bravery, partly by the swiftness of his horses. But the event was made the subject of a long heroic poem by Pentaur, the Egyptian Homer, who

won the prize for his verses above all other competitors in the seventh
year of the king's reign. It was treated with true epic exaggeration ; the interference of the gods was freely invoked, and the achievement transferred to the region of myth. But the vanity of Ramses never wearied of reading the legend in which he played the leading part. The poem was inscribed on the walls of Abydos, of Luxor, of Karnak,
of Abu-Simbel, —everywhere, in short, where the grand movarque raised
his buildings and allowed his subjects to read the record of his deeds.
As a matter of fact 'his victories over the Hittites were Kadmeian ones. At one time the Egyptian generals prevailed over the enemy,
and the statues of Ramses were erected in the city of Tunep, or carved
in stone at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb, while hymns of victory were sung at Thebes, and gangs of captives were lashed to work at the monuments of the mighty conqueror ; but at another time the tide of fortune changed, and Carchemish rather than Thebes had reason
to triumph. For years the struggle continued, until, in the thirtyfourth year of Ramses, the two nations, exhausted with the equally
balanced conflict, were fain to make peace. Ramses and Khita-sira,
" the great king of the Hittites," entered into an alliance, defensive
and offensive, agreeing that neither side should punish the political
off'enders who had fled from the one country into the other during the time of war. The Hittite text of the treaty was engraved on a
tablet of silver in the peculiar characters of Carchemish, while the Egyptian copy was sculptured on the walls of the temples of Ramses. It was ratified by the marriage of Ramses with the daughter
of the Hittite king.
Meanwhile raids were made upon the hapless negroes in the south, and Askalon, which had dared to resist the will of the Egyptian monarch, was stormed and sacked. The Libyans sent tribute, and fresh gold-mines were opened in Nubia, where miserable captives rotted
to death. The Israelites in Goshen built the treasure-cities of Pithom and Raamses, or Zoan, and colossal statues of the monarch were
carved out of the granite rocks of Syene, and set up in front of the temple of Ptah at Memphis, and of the Ramesseum, ** the tomb of Osymandyas," at Thebes. The monolith of the Ramesseum, now
shattered by earthquake, was no less than sixty feet high. But
Ramses cared more for the size and number of his buildings than for
their careful construction and artistic finish. The work is mostly
** scamped," the walls ill-built, the sculptures coarse and tasteless. To this, however, Abu-Simbel forms a striking exception. Here, among



EGYPT. 333
the silent sands of Nubia, one of the world's wonders was carved in the rock. A huge and solemn temple was hewn out of a mountain, and its entrance guarded by four colossi, each with a divine calm imprinted upon its mighty features, and with eyes fixed towards the rising of the sun. Abu-Simbel is the noblest memorial left us by the
barren wars and vainglorious monuments of Ramses-Sesostris. His family must have been a large one. The temple of Abydos records the names of sixty daughters and fifty-nine sons, the fourteenth of whom, Menephthah II., was the next king. His first work was to repel a formidable naval attack by Libyans and various tribes from
the north, in whom some have seen Sardinians, Sicilians, and Akhseans. They were led by the Libyan king, Marmaiu, the son of Did, and had penetrated as far as Heliopolis, sweeping over the Delta like a swarm of locusts. The invaders were almost completely destroyed, and prodigious booty fell into the hands of the royal army. This was in the
fifth year of the king's reign. Shortly afterwards, according to the
most accepted theory, the exodus of the Israelites took place (b.c.
1320). Three more inglorious reigns over a divided Egypt bring us to the end of the nineteenth dynasty. It had been a period of civil war
and foreign invasion. Arisu, a Syrian from Phoenicia, made himself
master of a large part of the country, at the head of an army of
revolted slaves. The history of this troubled time is glanced at in the great Harris papyrus ; it is given in more detail by Diodoros Siculus,^ who calls the rebels Babylonians, and by Manetho,^ who terms their leader Osarsiph, and identifies him with Moses. Osarsiph had been a priest oT Heliopolis, and in conjunction with the Hyksos, who had
sent troops from Jerusalem, occupied Avaris, the old fortress of the
Shepherds. For thirteen years Egypt suffered under this foreign rule; then Set-nekht, whom Manetho names Amenophis, advanced with an army from the south, drove out the Semites and slaves, put down the rival chiefs, and united the country under one sceptre. He ushered in the twentieth dynasty (b.c. 1288), and was succeeded by his son,

Eamses III., the Rhampsinitos of Herodotos, who had been a boy of
five years of age at the time of his father's successes. Ramses III. is the las); of the native heroes. Egypt was surrounded by its enemies when he assumed its double crown. The Libyans, under their princes Zamar and Zautmar, were the first to attack it. But they were driven
off after a fierce battle, in which they left 12,535 dead upon the field.
The next struggle was by sea. The Hittites of Carchemish, and their allies from the islands of the Mediterranean, from Asia Minor, and from the Kaukasos, came in overwhelming force in the ships of Arados. But they, too, were defeated and the waters reddened with their slaughter, while their camp on land was plundered and burned. Then, in the king's eleventh year, came a new assault by the Maxyes
under their chief Massala, the son of Kapur. They had penetrated as
far as the Kanopic branch of the Nile when the avenging hand of Ramses fell upon them. They were partly slain, partly drafted into the Egyptian forces, for Egypt was now obliged to depend largely upon mercenary troops. Even the negroes had ventured to invade the south, but they too were chastised, and the country was at last
at peace. Eamses had filled his coffers with the spoil of his enemies, and now increased his wealth by building a fleet of merchantmen in
the harbour of Suez, by renewing the mining-stations of Sinai, and by
opening mines of copper elsewhere. The construction of new temples marked the revival of Egyptian prosperity; and at Medinet-Abu, opposite Luxor, the solitary example of an Egyptian palace that remains was
erected. But with all his riches and success, Ramses was not pre
served from a dangerous harem -conspiracy, which, however, was detected and its authors put to death. When he died he left his son, Ramses IV., a prosperous and peaceful kingdom ; the empire of earlier days had gone, and Egypt was contracted to its own borders, but within those borders it was at peace. The succeeding kings of the nineteenth dynasty were all named Ramses, and each was as
insignificant as his predecessor. The high priests of Amun at Thebes
gradually supplanted their power, until at last all things were ripe for
revolution, and the high priest Hirhor seized the throne and established
a new dynasty (B.C. 1110). But though Hirhor claimed to be king of Upper and Lower Egypt, it was only in the Thebaid that his authority was undisputed. The descendants of Ramses XIII. and their adherents had been banished to the Great Oasis ; but a rival dynasty, alone recognised by Manetho under the title of the twenty-first, and founded by Si-Mentu Mei-Amun

or Smendes, ruled at Tanis. Another power, however, soon appeared upon the scene. A great-grandson of Ramses XIIL, the last king of the twentieth dynasty, had married the daughter of Panu-res-nes, " the great prince " of the Libyan mercenaries in the Delta, whom Brugsch supposes to have been an Assyrian monarch. But the names which he believes to be Assyrian are in no way so, and are probably to be regarded as Libyan.^ Pinotem (Pinetsem) II., the great-grandson of Hirhor, had been succeeded by his son Men-kheper-Ra, when Sheshank or Shishak, the leader of the mercenaries in the Delta, and fifth in descent from a certain foreigner named Bubui or Buai, with his son Naromath, established himself as independent king at Bubastis, A movement seems to have previously broken out at Thebes in favour of the banished Ramessids, in consequence of which the latter were recalled- Sheshank must have extended his power as far as Middle Egypt, since his son Naromath was buried in state during his father's lifetime at Abydos, while the throne of Tanis was occupied by Psiunkha or Pisebkhan I.,- the Psusennes of Manetho. It was during
this period of internal dissension that the bodies of Thothmes III., of Ramses II., and of the other great princes of the 18th and 19th
dynasties, were transferred from their tombs to the secret cavern near Deir el-Bahari, at Thebes, where they were interred along with the members of the family of Pinotem.^ Hor Psiunkha II.* was the successor of Psiunkha I., and was perhaps the king who sought to strengthen himself against the growing power of the Libyan mercenaries by marrying his daughter to Solomon. But all precautions were in vain. • Sheshank I., the descendant of the Sheshank already mentioned.

overthrew both the rival dynasties of Tanis and Thebes, and heads the
twenty-second dynasty, B.C. 980, establishing his court at Bubastis. Sheshank signalised his reign by overrunning Judah, Edom, and the southern part of Israel, arid capturing Jerusalem, a list of the conquered towns being engraved on the wall of Kamak. His successors, whose names have been erroneously imagined to be Assyrian, proved a race of rois faineants. Egypt became once more divided among a number of petty kings, and the Ethiopian monarchs of Napata, who derived their origin from the banished family of Hirhor, claimed
suzerainty over their former rulers. One of these, Pi-ankhi, has left
us a record of his triumphs over Tefnekht of Sais, — called
Tnephakhthos, the father of Bocchoris, by Diodoros, — who had captured Memphis and made himself master of all Lower Egypt. The rebel prince himself fled to Cyprus, but was pardoned and allowed
to return to Egypt. His son Bak-en-ran-ef, or Bocchoris, occupied the whole of Manetho's twenty-fourth dynasty, while Mi-Amun Nut, the son of Piankhi, reigned at Thebes. Bocchoris was captured and burned alive by the Ethiopian Shabaka or Sabako,^ the son of Kashta, who founded the twenty- fifth dynasty and reunited the Egyptian monarchy. After his defeat by Sargon, the Assyrian king, at Raphia in B.C. 720, he died, and was followed first by Shabatuk and then by Taharka (Tirhakah or Tarakos), the brother-in-law of Sabako. Tirhakah found himself in possession of a prosperous kingdom,

threatened, however, by the rising power of the Assyrians, and under
mined by native discontent at the rule of the Ethiopian stranger.
After the indecisive battle with Sennacherib at Eltekeh in B.C. 701, Tirhakah was left in peace for some years, until, in the twenty-third year of his reign (b.c. 672), he was attacked and driven out of Egypt by the Assyrian armies of Esar-haddon. Egypt became a province of
Assyria, divided into twenty satrapies, each governed by a native prince. It was these twenty satrapies that constituted the dodecarchy
of Herodotos. But more than once Tirhakah marched down from Ethiopia and endeavoured to recover his lost dominion. He was aided by the satraps and people, who naturally preferred the rule of the Ethiopian
to that of the Assyrian. Twice did he advance as far as the Delta, and twice was he driven back again by the Assyrians, Necho of Memphis and Sais, and the chief ally of Tirhakah, being on the

second occasion sent in chains to Nineveh. At last the old Ethiopian monarch died, and his successor Rut-Amen, or Urdaman, the son of Sabako, determined once more to wrest the sovereignty of Egypt from Asia. Thebes and Memphis opened their gates, and even Tyre sent help. But the Assyrians returned and executed terrible vengeance. No-Amon or Thebes was plundered and destroyed, the ground strewn with its ruins, and two of the obelisks at Karnak
sent as trophies to Nineveh.^ But the Assyrian yoke was at last shaken off. Psamtik or Psammetikhos, the son of Necho of Sais, led the insurgents. Bom in the Delta, he was probably of Semitic origin, but his marriage with a princess of the house of Bocchoris gave him the rights of a legitimate king. The moment was a favourable one for revolt. The Assyrian empire had been exhausted by the conquest of Elam, and the Viceroy of Babylonia was in open rebellion in concert with the nations of the
west. Gyges of Lydia sent Karian and Ionian troops to the aid of Psammetikhos, and with these he drove out the Assyrian garrisons
and reduced the vassal -kings. The decisive battle was fought at Menuf or Momemphis. Psammetikhos became the sole and independent lord of united Egypt, and the foreign mercenaries were rewarded with a permanent settlement near Bubastis. With the twenty-sixth dynasty (B.C. 660), the St. Luke's summer of Egyptian
history begins. The revival of peace, of power, and of prosperity, was marked also by a revival of art. Sais was adorned with buildings which almost rivalled the mighty monuments of Thebes ; the sacred bulls Were enshrined in vast sarcophagi in a new gallery of the Serapeum ; screens were introduced in the temples to hide the interior from the vulgar gaze; and a new cursive hand, the demotic, came into use. But the government had ceased to be national ; it had gained its power by Hellenic aid, and from this time forward Greek influence began to prevail The king's person is protected by a Greek body
guard ; the native soldiers desert to Ethiopia, and the oldest Ionic
inscription we possess records the pursuit of them by the foreign mercenaries of Psammetikhos. The mart of Naukratis is founded by the Milesians at the mouth of the Kanopic channel, and a new class of
persons, interpreters or dragomen, spring up in the country. Necho the son of Psammetikhos flung aside the old exclusive policy
of Egypt, and in rivalry with the merchant cities of Ionia strove to

make the Egyptians the chief trading people of the world. An attempt was accordingly made to unite the Red Sea and the Medi
terranean by cutting a canal from Bubastis to the Bitter Lakes, and
only given up after the death of 120,000 of the labourers. Phoenician
ships were sent to circumnavigate Africa, and returned successful after three years' absence. But the inland trade of Asia, which passed through Carchemish and Tyre, still remained to be secured. The fall of the Assyrian empire allowed this project also to be realised, and Josiah, who stood in the way of the Egyptian army, was defeated and slain. But the hymns of triumph once chanted to Amun were now replaced by an embassy to the Greek oracle of Brankhidse, carrying
with it the war-tunic of the Egyptian king. Egypt was fast becoming
Hellenised ; the old riddle of the sphinx was being solved, and the venerable mystery of Egypt yielding to the innovating rationalism of the upstart Greek. Necho's dreams of Asiatic sovereignty were dissipated by his defeat at Carchemish at the hands of Nebuchadrezzar. His successor, Psammetikhos II., reigned but five years ; Uah-ab-ra (Hophra), or Apries, who followed (b.c. 589), avenging his grandfather's reverses by capturing Sidon and Gaza, But Nebuchadrezzar
again shattered the Egyptian forces, and even overran Egypt itself. Then came the ill-fated expedition against Kyr^ne and Barka, followed by the revolt of the army and the accession of Aahmes II., or Amasis, to the throne (b.C. 570). Apries and his Greek mercenaries were overthrown at Momemphis, and Apries himself soon afterwards put to death. Amasis, a nobleman of Siuf, who had married a sister of the late king, and whose mother, Tapert, was related to Apries,^ continued the policy of his predecessors. One of his wives was a Greek of Kyr^ne. Naukratis was granted a charter and constitution, all Hellenes whatsoever being admitted to its privileges, and temples were raised to Hellenic gods. Meantime Kypros was conquered, and wealth and plenty flowed into Egypt. The end, however, was at hand. Kambyses declared war against the Egyptian king, and, led across the desert by a Greek refugee, entered Egypt (B.C. 525). Amasis died at this critical moment, and his young and inexperienced successor, Psammetikhos II., was defeated, captured in Memphis, and put to death. And so the land of Thothmes and Ramses became a dependency of the Persian Empire. In B.C. 486 a revolt broke out under Khabash, the effect of which

yvas to divert the preparations Darius had made for attacking Greece, :ind thus save Greece and the West. But the revolt itself was crushed by Xerxes in 483, and Achaemenes Kyros, whose tomb still exists at Murghab, the brother of Xerxes, was appointed satrap. Once
more, in B.C. 463, Egypt revolted again. Its leaders were Amyrtaeos and the Libyan king Inaros. Aided by the Athenians they won the battle of Papr6mis and fortified themselves in Memphis. But Megabyzus, the Persian general (b.c. 457), finally succeeded in capturing the Egyptian capital. Inaros was impaled, and Amyrtaeos
fled to the marshes of Elbo, his son Pausiris being appointed Persian
viceroy, and Thannyras vassal king of Libya. ^
In B.C. 415 came the third revolt. This time the insurgents were
successful. Amyrtaeos emerged from his place of refuge, —if, indeed, ho were the Amyrtaeos who had escaped from the Persians near half a century before, and ruled over an independent Egypt for six years. His successor, Naifaarut or Nepherites I., founded the twenty-ninth or Mendesian dynasty. Then came Hakar or Akhoris, who sent help to the Spartan king Agesilaos during his campaigns against Persia (B.C. 395), and allied himself with Evagoras of Kypros, who had driven the Persians from the island. His son was the last of the dynasty. He was followed by Nekht-hor-heb or Nektanebos I., the
leader of the thirtieth, who entrusted the command of his fleet to the Greek Khabrias. The army of Artaxerxes was repulsed, and temples
were built or restored in Lower Egypt. But it was the last efibrt of
the old Egyptian spirit. Tsiho or Teos, his successor, with the help of Agesil^ps, was deposed by his nephew, Nektanebos II., and fled to the Persian court. Eighteen years later Artaxerxes Okhos despatched an army to avenge the wrongs of Teos and recover a lost province to Persia. Sidon, with its Egyptian garrison, was taken, and the Persians, aided by Greek mercenaries, besieged and captured Pelusium. Tlie
Greek garrison of Bubastis surrendered, Nektanebos fled with his treasures to Ethiopia, and the last native dynasty ceased to exist (B.C.
340). The Persians did not enjoy their victory long. The empire soon passed from them to Alexander (b.c. 332). But for Egypt it meant only a change of masters. The Ptolemies might assume the dress and titles of the ancient Pharaohs, might worship the same gods and build the same temples, but they were as Greek in spirit as in language.

The mission of Egypt among the nations was fulfilled ; it had lit the torch of civilisation in ages inconceivably remote, and had passed it on
to the other peoples of the west. Its task now was to receive and shelter Alexandria, through which the culture of the West might be carried in turn to the decaying nations of the ancient East. In Alexandria, the meeting-place of Orient and Occident, of old and new,
of mysticism and science, the history of Pharaonic Egypt fitly comes to
a close.
Religion and Mythology.—The exact character of Egyptian religion
is a matter of dispute. All we can assert is that, as everywhere else, it underwent change and development during its long period of exist
ence, and that there was a considerable diff'erence between the religious
ideas of the upper and lower classes. The chief diflSculty it presents
is the mixture of high spiritual conceptions and debased animal-worship
which we find in it. Hence the conflicting theories it has called forth.
According to De Roug6, Egyptian religion was essentially monotheistic, other scholars see in it a pure pantheism, while Renouf makes it what has been termed henotheistic. The animal-worship has been accounted for by a mixture of race, a primitive Nigritian population being supposed to have been conquered by monotheistic or pantheistic
conquerors from Asia, who allowed the subject race to retain its old
superstitions. But this hypothesis is overthrown by further acquaintance with the monuments.
One thing is quite clear. The kernel of the Egyptian state
religion was solar. Each great city had its own deities, which, before
the time of Menes, had been united into a hierarchy. But at the head of each hierarchy stood a form of the Sun-god, worshipped as Ptah
at Memphis, Amun-Ra at Thebes, Tum at Heliopolis, Osiris at Tliis and Abydos, Mentu at Hermonthis. The unification of the empire
brought with it the unification of these various circles of gods. They were all grouped together under the sovereignty of Ptah Avhile the Old Empire lasted, of Amun when Thebes gained the supremacy. NtUer, " god," has been shown by Renouf to have originally meant "the strong one," a curious parallel to the Greek lepos, the equivalent
of the Sanskrit ishiras, whose primitive signification is still preserved
in such Homeric phrases as Upov fitvo^. Like men and animals, each god had his ka or " shadow," which was regarded not only as a second self, but also as more real and permanent than the self which we perceive. The abstract notion of divinity presented itself to the mind
of the Egyptian as the ka or soul of the universe. God in the



EGYPT. 341
abstract, with which each of the gods was identified in turn by the worshipper, or, in the later pantheistic period, into which they were all resolved, was conceived as one perfect, omniscient, and omnipotent being, eternally unchangeable, yet eternally begetting himself in the liquid chaos called Nu. The sun, which afterwards symbolised him,
was primarily the object of adoration itself And since the sun rises as the youthful Har-makhis or Horos, shines in his full strength at mid-day as Ea, and sets in the evening as Tum, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity found its counterpart in Egyptian religion from the dawn of
the historical period. Even the sun that shines at night in the lower world received also his name and worship, and ended by becoming the
enemy of light and of the sun that illuminates the day. By the side of the Sun-god stood Isis, the dawn, the mother, sister, wife, and double of the Sun-god himself. Out of the manifold myths that described the relations of the sun to the dawn and the evening arose various deities and conceptions of the divine, each of which assumed a
different form in different localities, and eventually found a place in
the syncretic religion of the united empire. The oldest and most widespread of these myths was that embodied
in the legend of Osiris. The Sun -god Osiris, like his sister Isis,
was the child of Nut, the vault of heaven, and of Seb, the earth. While still in their mother's womb they produced the ever-youthful
Horos, who is one with his father, and yet a diflferent divinity. Set
or Typhon, the husband of his sister Nephthys or Neb-hat, and brother of Horos, imprisoned Osiris in an ark or chest, which, with the help of seventy-two of his followers (the seventy-two days of summer drought),
he flung into the sacred Nile. The ark was borne across the sea to
the holy city of Phoenicia, Byblos or Gebal, and there found by the
disconsolate Isis. Isis, however, after hiding the corpse of the god, made her way to Horos, who had been banished to the marshes of Buto, and during her absence Set discovered the body of Osiris, which he cut into fourteen pieces and scattered to the winds. They were
again carefully collected by Isis and buried in a stately tomb, while Horos made ready to avenge his father's death. But Osiris had died
only to rise again, after ruling for awhile, during the hours of night, in the dark regions of the under world. It was thus that he became the judge and monarch of the dead. The struggle between Horos and Set was long and fierce ; but at length the god of light triumphed, and Set, the symbol of night and evil, was driven from his throne in the upper world. Horos became the mediator and saviour of mankind,



342 . APPENDIX I.
through whom the righteous dead are justified before the tribunal of
his father. In the philosophic system of the priesthood, Nun or Chaos was the
first cause from which all proceed, —unshaped, eternal, and immutable
matter. Kheper, the scarabaeus with the sun's disk, was the creative
principle of life which implanted in matter the seeds of life and light Ptah, " the opener," was the personal creator or demiurge, who, along
with the seven Khnumu or architects, gave form to these seeds, and was at once the creator and opener of the primaeval egg of the universe

the ball of earth rolled along by Kheper—out of which came the sun and moon according to the older myth, the elements and forms of heaven and earth according to the later philosophy. Nut, the sky, with the star and boat of the sun upon her back ; Seb, the earth, the symbol of time and eternity ; and Amenti or Hades, now took their several shapes and places. Over this threefold world the gods and
other divine beings presided. It would be wearisome to recount more than a few of the principal
divinities. Ptah, with his wife Sekhet, the cat-headed goddess of Bubastis, and his son Im-hotep or ^sculapius, comes first. He is represented with the body of a mummy and the symbols of power,
life, or stability in his hands. It was to him that the bull Hapi or
Apis, the representative of the creative powers of nature and the fertilising waters of the Nile, was sacred. Next to Ptah stands Ra, the
Sun-god of Heliopolis, worshipped under seventy-five forms, and called the king of gods and men. Into his hands Ptah had delivered the germs of creation, and, like Ptah, he had existed in the womb of Nu. Here he first appeared as Tum, the setting sun ; then, as he passed in
his boat over the waters of the lower world and the folds of the serpent Apepi during the night, he was known as Khnum ; while it is as the child Har-makhis (Hor-em-khuti), whose symbol is the sphinx, that he rises again from death and sleep each morning on the bud of
the lotus-flower that floats on the breast of Nu. This daily birth was
held to take place in the bosom of Isis, Mut, or Hathor. Ra is
represented with the head of his sacred bird, the hawk, and the solar disk surmounted by the ureeus above ; and the mystical Phoenix {bennu), which brings the ashes of its former self to Heliopolis every 500 years, seems also to have been his symbol. When worshipped as Tum (or Atum), he has a man's head, with the combined crowns of Upper and Lower Eg}*pt, though as Nofer-Tum he wears a lion's liead, above which stands a hawk with a lotus cro>vn. The name of Khnum



EGYPT. 343
(Khnubis or Knuphis) was originally derived from the local cult of Klephantin^, but came to be applied to Ra when regarded as passing from one day to another after his descent to the infernal world. His old attributes remained attached to him, so that he sometimes takes the place of Ptah, being represented as moulding the egg of the universe, and fashioning mankind. He has a ram's head, and the sjonbols connected with him show that his primitive worshippers regarded him as presiding over generation. Horos, symbolised now by the winged solar disk, now by a hawk -headed man, now by the
hawk bearing a scourge, now again by a child on a lotus flower, merges in the days of the united monarchy into Har-makhis, the avenger of
Osiris. But after the rise of the Theban dynasty the supreme form under which Ea was worshipped was Amun, " the hidden one." In course of time he absorbed into himself almost all the other deities of Egypt,
more especially Ra and Khuum. He reigns over this earth, as his representatives, the Pharaohs, over Egypt, and inspires mankind with
the sense of right. He is called Khem as the self-begetting deity,
" the living Osiris " as the animating principle of the universe. On
his head he wears a lofty crown of feathers, sometimes replaced by the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt or the ram's head of Khnum, and Mut and Khunsu form with him the trinity of Thebes. Ma or T-mei, the goddess . of truth and justice, was the daughter of the Sun-god, who carries on her head the upright ostrich-feather, and has her eyes covered with a bandage. Beside her stands Isis, at once the sister and wife of Osiris, and the mother of Horos. At Thebes she was known as Mut, " the mother," with the vulture's head ; at Bubastis as Sekhet, the bride of Ptah and daughter of Ra. As mother of Horos, she was named Hathor or Athor, " the house of Horos," identified by the Greeks with their Aphrodite, and confused with Astoreth by the Semites. The cow, with its horns, symbolising the
crescent moon, which in Egypt appears to lie upon its back, was con
secrated to her, indicating at how early a time the bride of Osiris, the Sun-god, was held to be the moon. She was also identified with
Sothis, the dog-star, and in later days with the planet Venus. All that is good and beautiful among men comes from her ; she watches over
the birth of children, and rocks the cradle of the Nile. As Neit,
too, she is the authoress of weaving and of the arts of female life. Against her stands Set or Typhon, jmmarily the night, into whoso
character and attributes a moral meaning was gradually read, so that



344 APPENDIX I.
in the time of the New Empire he became the representative of evil,
the enemy of the bright powers of light and goodness, the prince of
the powers of darkness. The crocodile was sacred to him, though Sebek, the crocodile-god, continued to be worshipped in the Fayftm and the neighbourhood of Kom-Ombos up to the classical period. Apepi also, the serpent of night, was associated with him, and came to partake of his demoniac character. His wife Nephthys or Neb-hat, the queen of the lower world, was the nurse of Horos and the sympathising sister of Isis. Her son, by Osiris, was the jackal-headed Anubis, " the master of Hades," who, like the Greek Hermes, guides the dead to the shades below. But it was with Tehuti or Thoth that the Greeks preferred to
identify their Hermes. Originally the god of the moon, like Khunsu, the ibis-headed Thoth, with his consort Safekhu, became the inventor
of writing, the regulator of time and numbers, and the patron of science and literature. The cynocephalous ape and the ibis were his sacred animals.
These animal forms, in which a later myth saw the shapes assumed by the affrighted gods during the great war between Horos and Typhon, take us back to a remote prehistoric age, when the religious creed of Egypt was still totemism. They are survivals from
a long-forgotten past, and prove that Egyptian civilisation was of slow
and independent growth, the latest stage only of which is revealed to us by the monuments. Apis of Memphis, Mnevis of Heliopolis, and Pacis of Hermonthis, are all links that bind together the Egypt of the Pharaohs and the Egypt of the stone age. They were the sacred
animals of the clans which first settled in these localities, and their
identification with the deities of the official religion must have been a
slow process, never fully carried out, in fact, in the minds of the
lower classes.
Another conception which the primitive Egyptians shared with most other barbarous or semi -barbarous tribes was the magical
virtue of names. This also survived into the historical epoch, and,
in union with the later spirit of personal ambition, produced an absorbing passion for preserving the name of the individual after death. His continued existence was imagined to depend upon the continued remembrance of his name. The Egyptian belief in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body thus had its
root in the old childlike superstition which confused together words
and things. In the philosophical system of the priesthood, however, it



EGYPT. 345
was given a new and more rational form. According to this, man
consists of three parts : the khat or body, which belongs to matter
;
the sahu or soul, which ultimately returns to its home in the lower world ; and the khu or spirit, an emanation from the divine essence.^
Each of these parts can exist separately, and each is eternal and immutable. But it is the soul which receives after death the rewards or punishments due to it for its thoughts and actions while in the
body. If the soul had triumphed over the bodily passions,—had been
pious towards the gods, and righteous towards men, —it passed in safety
through all the trials that awaited it below. Fortified by sacred texts
and hymns and amulets, and trusting in Horos the mediator, it subdued
the demons and horrible beasts that opposed its way, and at length
reached the hall of justice where Osiris with his forty-two assessors sat
as judge. Horos and Anubis now weighed the soul in its vase against the goddess of truth, and Thoth recorded the result. If the soul went down, it was sentenced to the various torments of hell, or to wander like a vampire between heaven and earth, scourged and buffeted by the tempests, or else doomed to transmigrate into the bodies of animals,
until permitted to regain its original body and undergo a fresh trial
;
there were cases even in which it might be annihilated. If, on the other hand, the soul remained evenly balanced, it was allowed
to enter the blissful fields of Aalu, there to be purified from all
the stains of its early life, and, after becoming perfect in wisdom and
knowledge, to be absorbed into the divine essence, or to live again upon earth in any form it chose. Finally, however, in the great day of
resurrection, soul, spirit, and body were again to be united, and for this purpose every care had to be taken lest the body should decay or become injured. Our knowledge of Egyptian mythology as distinct from Egyptian religion is still but scanty. Mention has already been made of the
Osiris myth, which entered so largely into the religious faith of the people. There was another legend which told how mankind had emanated from the eyes of the deity, and spread themselves over the earth as "the flock of Ra," the Rotu, or Egyptians, and Nahsi, or negroes, being under the guardianship of Horos ; the 'Amu, or Semites, and the white-skinned populations of Libya and the north, being under that of Sekhet. According to another version, however, mankind, with the exception of the negroes, had sprung from the
^ Khu is strictly the intelligence, and thus closely allied to the Johannine Logos.



346 APPENDIX I.
tears of Horos and Sekhet. Another myth, again, discovered by M.
Naville in the tomb of Seti I., states that mankind once uttered hostile words against their creator Ra, who took counsel with Nun. Hathor
or Sekhet, accordingly, was sent to slay them, and the earth was covered with their blood as far as Herakleopolis. Then Ra drank 7000 cups of wine made by Sekti of Heliopolis from the fruits of Egypt and mingled with the blood of the slain ; his heart rejoiced, and he swore that he would not again destroy mankind. Rain filled
the wells near Lake Mareotis, and Ra went forth to fight against his human foes. Their bows were broken, and themselves slaughtered, and the god returned victorious to heaven, where he created the Elysian
fields of Aalu and the people of the stars, charging the sacred cow, the incarnation of Nut, and the prototype of the Greek lo, with their guardianship ; while Shu, like Atlas, supports her on his two hands. Seb was then ordered to keep watch over the reptiles of earth and water, and Thoth over the lower world ; the ibis, the cynocephalous
ape, and the lunar disk, coming into existence at the same time. Though it is difficult to trace much change or development in the
religion of Egypt during the historical period as opposed to the pre
historic one, it is nevertheless plain that as time went on it assumed
a more mystical and esoteric character, which shows itself most conspicuously in the monuments of the Ptolemaic and Roman age. It was from this theosophic phase that the Neo-Platonism of Alexandria
and Neo-Platonic Christianity derived a large part of their ideas and principles. At the same time monotheism, or rather pantheism, became more clearly defined among the educated classes, the popular
gods being resolved into mystical manifestations or emanations of the
one divine substance. From the first, however, as is shown more
especially by the solar hymns, the Egyptian priests had a clear sense of
the unity of God, in so far as to regard the deity they happened to be addressing at the moment as the one omnipotent, omniscient, and
eternal ruler of the universe, to the exclusion of all others. But this
is strictly what Professor Max Miiller has called henotheism A further change may be observed in the conception of the future life between the monuments of the Old Empire and those of the Middle and New Empires. The sadness and gloom that overshadow the latter had not yet been felt. The tomb of Ti at Sakkarah, for instance, presents
us with pictures of the after world, in which the dead man lives over again his life in this ; he farms, hunts, superintends his workmen and
slaves, and feasts, just as he had done on earth. The shadow of the



EGYPT. 347
grave was not yet ever before the eyes of the Egyptian, and though he built tombs for himself while still alive, they mostly took the shape of pyramids, raised on the ground and pointing to the sky, not of dark and gloomy subterranean chambers. We should look in vain in them
for those representations of the torments and trials which await the
dead below, of the headless souls and horrible coils of the monstrous serpent Apepi, that startle us on the pictured walls of the royal tombs at Thebes. The myth of Osiris had not yet begun to exercise the terrible influence it afterwards obtained over the imagination of the
people, and the Book of the Dead still consisted of only a few simple
chapters. The Apotheosis of the Roman emperors had been long anticipated
in Egypt. The kings were representatives and, in a political sense,
incarnations of the deity ; divine worship was offered to them, and
priests were attached to their cult. The cult of the most powerful of
the kings lasted for centuries, or after being discontinued was sometimes revived for dynastic and other reasons. Thus the cult of Sent
of the second djniasty, and Sahura of the fifth, lasted into the age of the Ptolemies ; that of Menes, of Ser (of the third dynasty), of Kheops, Khephren, Ra-tatf, Snefru, and Ramses II., down to the time of the Persian conquest; that of Usertasen III. to the reign of Thothmes III.
;
though the pyramid-builders seem to have been forgotten in the epoch
of the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties. The adoration paid to the kings had its root in that ancestor-worship which was always popular
in Egypt, and was a survival from the prehistoric past.
The priesthood was divided into several classes ; the high-priest of
Amun and his associates ranking at their head, at all events under the
New Empire. Next to these priests came the four orders of prophets, out of whom the ministers of the worship of the deceased kings were chosen ; and below them again the abu, or divine fathers. Sacred
scribes were attached to the temples, as well as servants and slaves.
Monks, too, lived in cells in the precincts. Besides the priests and
prophets there were also priestesses and prophetesses ; and women of the highest rank were proud to be the prophetesses, the singing-women, and the sistrum-players of Amun. The priests and their families were supported out of the revenues of the temple to which they belonged,
and so formed a corporation ; and all matters relating to religion and public worship were under their control. The embalmers were an
inferior order of priests.
Art, Science, and Literature. —Egyptian art falls into two broadly



348 APPENDIX I.
marked periods. The art of the Old Empire is realistic, vigorous, and
full of originative genius ; that of later times, stiff, conventional, and
hieratic. Art is at its best in the age of the pyramid-builders ; its
future history is a history of continuous decline. Those who have not
seen the diorite statue of Khephren or the wooden statue of the
" Sheikh el-Belad " in the Bdlak Museum, or the exquisitely painted bas-reliefs of the tomb of Ti, have no conception of what Egyptian art once was. The colossal productions of the Middle and New Empires hardly make up by grandness of design for the want of artistic
originality. Spontaneousness and faithfulness to nature were but ill replaced by mysticism and symbolism.
Fluted columns with sixteen sides, which bear a close general resemblance to the Doric column (though wanting the echinus that distinguished the latter), first meet us in the tombs of Beni-Hassan and Siut, and thus make their appearance as soon as the pyramid was superseded by the rock-cut tomb. Columns in the shape of four lotus stalks bound together, their blossoms forming the capital, also occur along with them, and introduce a series of columnar architecture, which reaches its final perfection in the papyrus and palm crowned
pillars of Edfu and Esneh. The most peculiar and unpleasing feature of these columns is the square box on the top of the capitals. In the
Ptolemaic age the shaft often terminates in a square adorned with four masks of Hathor, above which is a miniature temple facade. From the time of the eighteenth dynasty downwards, the shaft of the column is frequently replaced by the figure of Osiris, with the arms crossed over the breast
The Mastdbas or mortuary chapels of the Old Empire, several of which may still be seen adjoining the pyramids of Gizeh, were replaced in later days by sumptuous temples, of which the Memnonium at Thebes may be taken as an example. These temples were built after the model of those raised to the gods by the monarchs of the Middle Empire, since we know of none that belong to the age of the Old
Empire. They were intended, not for religious service, but for pro
cessions, and were jealously protected from the eyes of the " profanum vulgus." Hence the lofty shrines of stone with which they were
surrounded ; hence, too, the fact that walls and columns and ceilings
were covered with sculptures and paintings that could not be seen
until light was introduced into them by the ruin of the buildings themselves. Even the secret passages at Denderah are decorated
with carefully-executed bas-reliefs. Since the temples were used as



EGYPT. 349
fortresses, as well as for sacred purposes—a fact which will explain the
ruined condition of many of them—they were guarded at the entrance by two pylons or towers, where the temple-watchmen lived. Before the pylons standards were planted, and between them was the entrance through which the procession passed into court after court, chamber
after chamber, until the shrine itself was at last reached. Here stood the images of the gods. In the rock-cut temples of Nubia the Theban Trinity is hewn out of the stone, with the king himself seated in its
midst.
The surface of the stone was covered throughout with bas-reliefs
and brilliant paintings. In the latter art the Egyptians excelled from
the earliest period. But they ostentatiously disregarded the most
elementary rules of perspective, under the influence of the hieratic
canon, though such objects as flowers, animals, fish, and butterflies,
were reproduced with pre-Raffaelite fidelity.
The Egyptians were skilful artificers. Their chairs, couches, and
other articles of household furniture, display great taste and variety,
and their work in the precious metals and gems is of the highest
order. Porcelain and glass are among their earliest productions, and
they were acquainted with the art of soldering metals, including iron,

which shows that Herodotos (i. 25) was wrong in ascribing the
discovery of this art to Glaukos—as far back at least as the eighteenth
dynasty. Imbrication, or the art of laying plates of metal one upon the other, was also known to them, as well as the art of damascening. Art in Egypt, as elsewhere, attained an earlier development than science At the same time, the monuments left by Egyptian art imply a considerable knowledge of mechanics, geometry, and engineering. The Great Pyramid faces the four points of the compass with marvellous
exactitude, and the obelisk of Queen Hatasu at Karnak, the tallest in the world, was cut out of the granite quarries of Assuan, engraved,
polished, floated down the Nile, and set up in its place, in seven months ! Professor Eisenlohr has discovered that mathematics were
studied at the court of the Hyksos princes, as the Ehind papyri contain a work on geometry (written for Apepi I.) which may be
described as a treatise on applied arithmetic. Astronomy of a somewhat elementary character was cultivated for the sake of the calendar. The year was divided into twelve months of thirty days, to which, in
the prehistoric age, were added five more ; but as in this way a whole day was lost every four years, recourse was had to the famous Sothic
cycle, determined by the heliacal rising of Sopt or Sothis, the Dog-star,



350 APPENDIX I.
on the first of Thoth (the 28th of July), once in 1460 years, when the year returned to its normal condition, and the inundation of the Nile commenced on the Egyptian New Year's Day. The end of one Sothic
cycle fell in A.D. 139;^ and the festival which commemorated tlie rising
of Sothis was ascribed to the mythical days of the Hor-shesu. The akhimu-urdu or planets (Har-tep-sheta Jupiter, Har-ka-Jier Saturn, Harmakhis or Har-desher Mars, Sehek Mercury, and Diiau or Bennu Venus) were distinguished from the akhimu-seku or fixed stars, and the
sun was believed to wander through the heavens like the planets. It may be added that the month was divided into three decades, as among the Greeks and early Latins (cp. the nundincB), each day being further divided into twelve hours, as in Chaldea.
It was in medicine, however, that Egypt attained any real scientific eminence. According to Manetho, the successor of Menes wrote treatises on anatomy, and a medical work mentioned in the
Berlin papyrus is said to have been first composed in the reign of a predecessor of King Sent of the second dynasty. Such statements, however, are due to the Egyptian fancy for antedating literary productions, and the oldest medical papyrus we possess (the Papyrus Ebers) does not mount back beyond the eighteenth dynasty. By that time medicine was in almost as advanced a state as in the age of Galen ; the various diseases known were carefully distinguished from
one another, and their symptoms were minutely described, as well as
their treatment. The prescriptions recommended in each case are
made out in precisely the same way as the prescriptions of a modem
doctor. One of these was derived from a fashionable Semitic oculist
of Byblos, but the greater part belonged to earlier Egyptian medical men, some of whom flourished under the first dynasties. The medicines
used were of four kinds — draughts, blisters, powders, and clysters,
minerals as well as vegetables being employed in their composition. But progress in medical knowledge, as in art, was checked in the time of the Middle Empire by the rule that new medicines and treatment were adopted by the doctor at the risk of being put to death if the patient died. Anatomy does not seem to have advanced so far as medicine, and Sir E. Wilson disputes the statement that mummies have been found with their teeth stopped with gold, while some have

been found with broken bones grown together naturally. In fact, the anatomical theory of the Egyptians is sufficient to show that anatomy was still in its infancy. According to this the breath is drawn from the breast to the head, through thirty-two channels or veins, and then
transmitted to the limbs. In the later days of Egyptian history,
magical formulae and exorcisms began to take the place of the older
medical prescriptions ; diseases were referred to the malignity of evil
spirits, and the priest and sorcerer superseded the physician. A demotic papyrus at Leyden is almost wholly occupied with charms,
especially love-philtres. Egyptian literature embraced the whole circle of the knowledge of the time. Writing was as old as the united monarchy, and the son of Menes was believed to have been an author. Already, in the time of the sixth dynasty, we find an official buried at Gizeh who bears the
title, " Controller of the library." But of this literature only a few
papyri, and still fewer texts engraved on stone, like the poem of Pentaur, have come down to us, the papyri being written in hieratic
and demotic. The most ancient we possess is the " Papyrus Prisse," composed under the eleventh dynasty, and containing two ethical
treatises, one by Kakimma, who lived in the reign of Snefru, the other by Ptah-hotep, the son of king Assa of tlie fifth dynasty. Both
treatises are collections of homely, practical wisdom, resembling the
book of Proverbs, or the writings of Confucius. Equanimity, honesty, benevolence, and prudence, are inculcated, and the husband is told
:
"Love thy wife and cherish her as long as thou livest; be not a
tyrant^ flattery acts upon her better than rudeness." " If thou art
wise," says Ptah-hotep again, " bring up thy son to fear God. If he obey thee, walking in thy steps, and caring for thy goods as he
ought, then show him all favour. Yet thy foolish son is also thine
own offspring; estrange not thine heart from him, but admonish him." Ptah-hotep Uved to the ripe age of 110 years, and though he
begins by enumerating all the miseries of old age, like the writer of Ecclesiastes, he finds in the wisdom and experience it brings more than compensation.
The chief monument of the religious literature of ^gypt is the Book of the Dead, in 106 chapters, now being critically edited by M.
Naville. Portions of it were inscribed on the mummy -cases and tombs, and are met with in the latest of the demotic papyri. It was, in fact, the funeral ritual of the Egyptians, describing in mystical
language the adventures of the soul after death, and the texts it must



352 APPENDIX I.
quote in order to escape the torments and trials of the lower world.
It is the literary reflection of the Osiris myth, and grew along with
the latter. A hieratic text of the eleventh dynasty gives two varying
versions of the sixty -fourth chapter, ascribed to King Menka-ra, from which we may infer the antiquity of the latter. But only the essence of the work went back to the Old Empire. The rest consisted
of additions and glosses, and glosses of glosses, which continued to be
made up to the time of the Persians. The oldest portion seems to
have been of a practically moral character, contrasting strikingly with
the mystical tone of the later accretions, where the doctrine of justi
fication by faith in Osiris has taken the place of that of good works.
Besides the Book of the Dead may be quoted the Litanies to the
Sun-god, which are full of deep spiritual feeling, and are monotheistic
in tone. Magical works are plentiful, but they mostly belong to the closing days of the kingdom. With these may be coupled the popular
tales and romances, such as " The Tale of the Two Brothers," written by Enna under the nineteenth dynasty, and bearing some resemblance to the history of Joseph, or the story of Setna, which turns on the magical powers of the Book of Thoth, or the legend of the cure of
Bent-resh, the daughter of the prince of Bakhten and sister-in law of Ramses XII. A document at Leyden contains an exorcism by the help of which a husband sought to rid himself of the visits of his
wife's ghost. Correspondence also occupies a considerable place in
Egyptian literature. We have copies of private letters, like that of
" The Sotem Mersuatef to his mistress, the priestess of Isis, Tanur," of
piiblic and royal correspondence, and of collections similar to Lord
Chesterfield's letters or the "Complete Letter-writer." Among these
is a letter in which the scribe contrasts the pursuit of literature
with other trades and professions, very much to the disadvantage of
the latter. The account of the Mohar's travels in Syria and Palestine,
where he visited Aleppo and insular Tyre among other places, and de
scribes his sufferings at the hands of robbers, in the time of the nine
teenth dynasty, may also be included under this head. So, too, may the autobiography of Saneha, a Semite of the Delta, who fled from Egypt
for political reasons, and after slaying a sort of Goliah obtained wealth and power in the court of Ammu-anshi, king of Upper Tennu, the later Edom. The desire of seeing his native land again came u})on him in his old age, and he obtained permission from Amen-em-hat I. to return home. Perhaps, however, this latter work should more fitly be classed, as it is by Maspero, among the historical romances of the



EGYPT. 353
Egyptians, like the story of the capture of Joppa by Tlautii, the general of Thothmes III., which bears a striking resemblance to the title of Ali-Baba in the Arabian NiglUs. Closely connected with the epistolary branch of Egyptian literature are the papyri, which contain
memoranda or accounts, as well as the official documents kept by the
royal scribes. Among these are accounts, which show that provision
was made for the support of sick labourers. Tribute - lists and
geographical catalogues are perhaps the most important of this class of documents, though the mutilated Turin papyrus, with its chrono
logical table of Egyptian kings, has a still higher value. Judicial
records, again, are not rai*e, even if the oldest deeds are those of the
time of Tirhakah. One record describes the trial of certain conspirators
against the life of Ramses III., with the punishments allotted to them. From others we learn that commissioners might be appointed to investigate charges afterwards brought before the judges in court, that the evidence was taken down in writing, and that even cases
between master and slave had to come before the judge. Petitions were presented directly to the king. Egyptian law was mild ; torture seems to have been unknown, and mutilations exceptional Even the punishment of death was rare, and usually took the form of decapitation or compulsory suicide. It is noticeable that the artist who has portrayed the naval victory of Ramses III. at Medinet Abu has depicted some of the triumphant Egyptians attempting to rescue the
sinking crew of an enemy's ship — an act of humanity unparalleled among the other nations of the ancient world. The treaty between
Ramses II. and the Hittites gives us an insight into the international
law of the time.
As in most despotic countries, satirical writing and beast-fables
were employed ; indeed. Professor Mahaffy suggests that the beast
fable owes its origin to Africa. One of the caricatm-es in the satirical papyrus of Turin represents Ramses III. with a lion's head, playing draughts (a game of which he seems to have been very fond) with one of his harem, who is transformed into a gazelle.
Poetry, apart from the religious hymns, was much cultivated. The Epic of Pentaur, the poet-laureate of Ramses II., has been compared with the Iliad, though it resembles the Greek poem only in general character, since it never became popular, and owes its preservation to the vanity of the king whose imaginary deeds it records, and
who, like AkhillSs, is made to address his horses by their names. The
poem seems to have been selected after a sort of competitive examina2A

tion. Its author, Pentaur, had been the private secretary of the royal librarian, Amenemen, who, in a letter preserved in the Sallier Papyrus
I., scolds him for not having sent the provisions of the season to the
palace. But epics and religious hymns were not the only forms in which Egyptian poetry clothed itself. A long poem on the praise of
learning, probably composed in the time of the twelfth dynasty, is found in the Sallier Papyrus II. ; the ode to the Nile, by Enna (the
author of the " Tale of the Two Brothers "), is secular rather than reli
gious ; and the lyrics contained in the Anastasi Papjrri are of great
beauty. Egyptian poetry was simple in structure, and chiefly
depended, like Hebrew poetry, upon the parallelism of ideas; but
Ebers has shown that it also made use of rhyme and alliteration. Historical literature is unfortunately rare, if we except such documents as the Harris papyrus, the largest papyrus known, which gives
the history of Ramses III. For the annals of the kings we must
rather look to the walls of the temples and the tombs, or to the stelse
and similar monuments. It is seldom that we come across so straightforward an inscription as that of Piankhi, or one so free from intermin
able titles, and Piankhi was an Ethiopian. Egyptian writing was a system of survivals. It was at once
ideographic, syllabic, and alphabetic. The older phases through which
it passed were preserved along with those which, in a less conservative country, would have superseded it. The oldest written monuments we possess exhibit it already formed and complete. Its invention must,
therefore, long precede the age of Menes. The characters are pictorial, primarily representing objects and ideas, while some are used
as determinatives. Each character also denotes one or more syllables,
and several further represent the single letters with which the words symbolised by them begin. For the sake of clearness the same word
may be expressed ideographically (by a pictorial hieroglyph), syllabi
cally, and alphabetically, all at once. Before the time of the Middle
Empire, and probably as early as the first dynasty, a "hieratic" running-hand had been formed out of the hieroglyphics, and in the ninth century B.C. this became the "demotic" hand, the characters of which are still more unlike the original forms from which they were derived than those of the hieratic papyri. Hieratic is always written
from right to left, whereas the hieroglyphics may run indifferently from left to right, or from right to left. As was shown by De Eoug^, the Phoenicians of the Delta or Caphtor (Keft-ur, "Greater Phoenicia") adopted the letters of the Egyptian alphabet in the hieratic forms



EGYPT. 355
current in the Hyksos period, and handed them on to their kindred in Canaan, among whom they received new names, while retaining their
old values. The first letter, for example, ceased to be called Ahom,
" the eagle," and became Aleph (alpha), " the ox."
Language, Law, Trade, and Culture. —The Egyptian language bears a distant resemblance to the Semitic dialects in grammar, though not
in vocabulary. It is simple in structure, and inflectional in form,
marking the relations of words by suffixes and composition. It is already an old language when we first meet with it on the monuments, and it changed considerably during the course of Egyptian history. The language of the Old or Middle Empire would have been unintelligible to the Ordinary Egjrptian of the time of Herodotos ; thus on the phonetic side, ts became successively d and t, and Kliufu or Kheops
was called Shufu in later days. Law has already been mentioned under the head of literature. As in England, the king was regarded as the source of justice, and at all events in the Ptolemaic period the judges went on circuit. The
government was imperialistic. The king was a deified autocrat, but
affairs were really managed by an organised bureaucracy. A council of thirty seems to have accompanied the monarch on his mihtary expeditions, and he and the royal princes nominally commanded the
army. The latter was divided into diflTerent corps, each named after
its patron divinity. From the time of the nineteenth dynasty downward it consisted largely of Negro, Libyan, and other mercenaries ; in fact, as in the case of the Roman Empire, it came eventually to consist
of them almost entirely. The fleet, with its one-oared galleys, never
attained a high development. The soldiers acted as a police-force at home, under magistrates {ga), who heard civil suits, and prefects (mer)
were appointed over the large cities. The nomes had each their ha or governor.
Trade during the Old Empire seems to have been small. Eg)rpt
mainly depended on domestic agriculture, and, like China, was jealous of strangers. The mafka, or turquoise, and copper mines of Sinai, however, were early occupied and worked, and the use of bronze implies a knowledge of tin. A fragment of ^vrought plate-iron has been found in the Great Pyramid,^ but this may have been made of haxi en-pe or
meteoric iron, rather than of ha-nu-ta or terrestrial iron. Certainly
Thothmes III. received iron vessels as tribute from Syria and Phce

nicia. Gold was worked under the first dynasties, but it was the Middle Empire that opened the Nubian gold mines. A plan of those of Rhedesieh and Kuban (Kobban) exists in a Turin papyrus of the nineteenth dynasty. With the rise of the New Empire and the Semitic occupation of the Delta trade largely increased, favoured by the
conquests in Asia. Com, linen, and horses were exported in return for the products of Asia and Cush. The expedition sent by Hatasu to Punt, or the Somali coast, had a commercial object, and Punt henceforth
supplied Egypt with incense, gums, cosmetics, monkeys, apes, hounds,
and panther-skins. The Phoenicians brought vases of gold, silver, and terra-cotta, many of them with covers made in the shape of animals' heads. Sesostris attempted to join the Mediterranean and the Red Sea by a canal, and Necho despatched Phoenician sailors to circumnavigate
Africa. From the age of the earliest monuments downwards, the Egyptians
were acquainted with all the luxuries and comforts of cultivated life. The country swarmed with artisans and handicraftsmen of all kinds. Glass-blowers are depicted on monuments of the twelfth dynasty, and
a fragment of dark-blue glass bears the praenomen of Antef III. of the
eleventh. Vases of beautiful blue porcelain go back to the age of the
Old Empire, and the dyed cloths of Egypt were justly celebrated. Wine and beer were drunk, and dinner-parties were given by the wealthy, at which the guests sat on chairs. For amusements they had
dancers, musicians, singers, tumblers, and jugglers, games like that of
draughts, or field-sports. Their dress was light, as was natural in a
hot climate, and sandals were unknown before the fifth dynasty. The head was shorn, and enormous wigs worn over it, partly for the sake
of cleanliness, partly for protection from the sun. Artificial beards
were also used. Children went undressed before the age of puberty, and were distinguished by a single lock of hair on the left side. Their education was carefully attended to, and they were trained in "all the wisdom of the Egyptians." As stated by Herodotos, the Egyptians were monogamous ; the king, however, was allowed to have several wives, and the great nobles might keep harems. Marriage between
brother and sister was also permitted,— a survival from a primitive condition of polyandry. But the woman in Egypt held a high position, very unlike that occupied by her in Greece or in modem
Oriental countries. She was the equal of her lord, went about freely and unveiled in public, and could ascend the throne in her own right
as far back as the beginning of the second dynasty. Indeed, it would



EGYPT. 357
seem that at this period the children traced their descent through the
mother rather than through the father. In character the Egyptians formed a strong contrast to the other leading nations of antiquity. Gentle, good-tempered, unwarlike, and humane, they achieved success in war only by the help of superior organisation and equipment Home-loving and industrious, they made their country the seat of
culture and material prosperity. If, like other southern races, they had not the same notions of truth as the northern European, their
legal institutions show that they had a profound sense of justice and
equity. Under the ever-increasing tyranny and servility of the New
Empire, it is true, their political character deteriorated ; but up to the
last the pure-blooded inhabitants of Middle Egypt preserved some of
that democratic spirit which still distinguishes the Egyptian of to-day. Their deep religious fervour was tempered by light-heartedness, and prevented from passing into fanaticism ; and if from time to time they
showed themselves excitable, it was the excitability of healthy children under a warm sun and a bright sky.
IL
BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA.
Geographically, as well as ethnologically and historically. Babylonia
and Assyria form but one country. It is therefore with justice that classical writers sometimes speak of the whole district between the Euphrates and Tigris as Assyria, though Babylonia would no doubt have been a more accurate name. The district naturally falls into two divisions, the northern being more or less mountainous, while the southern is flat and marshy, and a sharp line of separation is drawn between them at a spot where the two rivers approach closely to one
another, and the undulating table-land of the north sinks suddenly
into the alluvial flats of Babylonia. It was in these rich and loamy
flats, however, that the civilisation of Western Asia first developed. The northern plateau was inhabited by a mixture of uncultivated tribes at the earliest period of which we have any knowledge, and was known under the general name of Gutium or Guti (Kutu in Assyrian), first identified by Sir H. Rawlinson with the Goyim of Gen. xiv. 1. Gutium comprised the whole country which stretched from the Euphrates on the west to Media on the east ; the land of Nizir, with



358 APPENDIX II.
the mountain of Rowandiz, on which the ark of the Chaldean Noah
was believed to have rested, being included within it. The later king
dom of Assyria formed a portion of it, as well as the great plain of Mesopotamia, which was bounded on the west by Palestine or Martu, the land of " the path of the setting sun," and on the north by
Subarti, " the highlands " of Aram or Syria. The plain of Meso
potamia, now known as El-Jezireh, is about 250 miles in length, and
is intersected by a single mountain ridge, which rises abruptly out of the plain, and, branching off from the Zagros range, runs southward and eastward under the modem names of Saraz6r, Hamrin, and Sinjar. The numerous tels and other remains of old habitations, even apart from the evidence of the Assyrian inscriptions, show how thickly
tnis level region must once have been populated, though it is now for the most part a wilderness. North of the plateau rises a well-watered
and undulating tract of country, diversified by low ranges of limestone hills, sometimes barren, sometimes clothed with dwarf-oaks, which
often shut in rich plains and fertile valleys between their northern and north-eastern slopes and the main mountain-line from which they detach themselves. Beyond them are the lofty summits of the Niphates and Zagros ranges, where the Tigris and Euphrates have their sources, and by which Assyria was cut off from Armenia
and Kurdistan.
Geography and Race.—Assyria took its name from the primitive
capital of A-sur (or A-usar, "water-bank," later Assur), now Kaleh ShergJmi, which stood on the right bank of the Tigris, midway between the Greater and the Lesser Zab, and was founded in prae
Semitic times. Some sixty miles to the north, beyond the greater
Zab, was another city of nearly equal age, but originally of smaller
size and importance, called Niim, Ninua, or Nineveh, " the fish-town," now represented by the mounds of Nebi Yunus and Kouyunjik, opposite Mossul, and built on the banks of the Tigris and Khusur, the modem Khosr. After the northward extension of the Assyrian kingdom, the capital was moved from Assur to Nineveh by Shalmaneser I. (about B.C. 1300), and from henceforward Nineveh remained the chief city of the empire. Calakh or Calah, however, the modern Nininid, founded by the same Shalmaneser, from time to time proved a formid
able rival of its sister city, and was a favourite residence of Assur
natsir-pal, Shalmaneser II., and Tiglath-Pileser II. Between Calah and Nineveh lay Res-eni or Resen ("the head of the spring"),
probably the Larissa (Al Resen, " city of Resen ") of Xenophon {Anab.



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 359
iii. 4), occupying the site of the mound of Selamiyeh. About ten miles to the north of Nineveh was Dur-Sargina (now Khorsabad), built in the shape of a square by Sargon, whose palace was erected on a platform shaped like a T on its north-west side. Nine miles to the
east of Nimr6d is Balaw^t, called Imgur-Bel, " the habitation of Bel,"
by Assur-natsir-pal, who built a temple there to the Dream-god, and from which the bronze gates commemorating the achievements of Shalmaneser II., and now in the British Museum, have been brought. On the northern frontier of Assyria was Tarbitsu, now Sherlf Khan, while Arbela, now Ervil, on the east, was an early seat of the worship
of Istar, and a city of considerable importance. South-west of it lay Kalzu, enlarged and fortified by Sennacherib ; while the Mespila (Muspilu, " low-ground ") of Xenophon, where the Medes made a final stand against Kyros, must have been a little to the north of Nineveh. Besides these there were numerous other cities, more than twenty of the most important of which are enumerated among the insurgents against Shalmaneser II. ; while the Bavian inscription of Sennacherib contains a long list of the smaller towns and villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital. But in populousness and antiquity Assyria was far exceeded by the southern kingdom of Babylonia. Here were the centre and starting-point of the civilisation which afterwards spread throughout
Western Asia. Its primitive inhabitants, whom we will term Accadians,
traced their origin to the mountainous country south of the Caspian, from whence they had spread over Elam or Susiania, the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the fertile plain of Babylonia. The country subsequently known as Assyria was also once inhabited by them ; and even Harran, in the western part of Mesopotamia, seems to have been of Accadian foundation. Their physical type was a peculiar one ; the features were long and narrow, the eyes small, the cheek-bones prominent, the nose slightly retroussd, and the beard long and straight. The languages and dialects spoken by them were agglutinative, and in
phonology, — more especially the laws of vocalic harmony, — gram
matical machinery, and vocabulary, approach more nearly to the UralAltaic family of speech than to any other known group of tongues. So far as we are at present acquainted with them, they fall into two divi
sions, —the first comprising the Amardian or Protomedic of Susiania,
the Cassite of Kossaea, and the dialect spoken in the neighbourhood of
Susa ; while the second includes the two closely-related dialects spoken
in Babylonia itself, chiefly distinguished by the substitution of m in



360 APPENDIX II.
the one for b in the other, and the use of different words, such as duga
and tsibba for " good." The civilisation of Babylonia seems to have originated in Anzan or Southern Susiania and the coasts of the Persian Gulf, out of which, according to the legend, the semi-human
Cannes arose at dawn with the revelation of culture and knowledge. The pictorial hieroglyphics which afterwards became the cuneiform characters were first invented in Elam, as is shown by such facts
as the want of a simple character to denote the palm, or the use of
the picture of a mountain to signify a country. In Babylonia, however, the civilisation which had been brought from the mountains of the East underwent a rapid development. The country was divided into two halves, the northern half, comprehending Sippara and Babylon,
being known as Accad (Acada), " the highlands," or rather the country of " the highlauders ; " and the southern half, which included Erech, Lar'sa, and perhaps Ur, as Sumer or Shinar. The land on the western bank of the Euphrates went under the general name of Edinna, *' the
desert," the Eden of Scripture, the sacred grove and garden in the
neighbourhood of Eridu, at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, being the " Garden of Eden " of Genesis. The sea extended as far as the latter city, identified by Sir H. Rawlinson with the modern Dhib,
in which we may perhaps see a reminiscence of its old Sumerian title, Tsibba, " the good." The date of its foundation may be approximately
fixed by the rate at which the alluvial soil has grown below it. In the time of Alexander the Tigris and Euphrates flowed by different mouths into the sea, as did also the Eulseus or Kanm in the Assyrian
epoch ; and Dr. Delitzsch calculates that a delta of between forty and fifty miles in length has been formed since the sixth century B.C.^ The land of Edinna was irrigated by canals, and Ur, now Mugheir,
was built on its outskirts. Sumer, called also " the country of the
black faces," and " the country " par excellence, was the earliest seat of
Chaldean civilisation, and consequently took rank before Accad, the population of which had descended from the mountains of Elam after the settlement of the southern province. Among its cities may be mentioned Erech or Uruk, now Warka, whose Accadian name, " the city," implies that it had once been the capital of the whole country ;
Nipur, the city of Bel, now Niffer; Lar'sa, perhaps the Ellasar of
Genesis, the city of the sun, now Senkereh or Sinkara ; ZirguUa, now Zerghul ; Dur or Diru, " the fortress," now Deyr ; Chilmad, now
' See PUny, N. H. vi. 130.



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 361
Kilwadha ; Duran or Duban, Karrak or Nisin, Amarda or Marad, Abnunna or Umliyas, and Kul-unu, the biblical Calneh. Babylon, however, and the neighbouring town of Kis, now El Hymer, were not included in Sumer. Babylon consisted of the two Accadian towns of
Ca-dimirra, "the gate of God," and Din-Tir, *Hhe seat of the tree (of life)," on opposite sides of the Euphrates, which, after the Semitic con
quest, were united into one, known as Bab-ili or Babel, the Semitic
translation of Ca-dimirra. The city was made the capital of the county by the Cassite invader Khammuragas, a position it retained up to its entire destruction in B.C. 690 by Sennacherib, who choked the stream of the Arakhtu with its ruins. Rebuilt by Esar-haddon, it
soon recovered its old importance, and after being united with its suburb, Barzip or Borsippa, became the centre of the empire of Nebu
chadrezzar. The chief city of Northern Accad was, like Babylon, built on the two banks of the Euphrates, the larger half being called 'Sipar or Sippara, " the city of the sun " (now Abu Habba), and the smaller half Agan^ (or Agadh6). Agan6 subsequently took the title of " Sippara of the moon -goddess," whence the scriptural name Sepharvaim, " the two Sipparas." To the east of Sepharvaim was Tiggaba or Kute (Cuthah), now Tel-Ibrahim, and to the north Dur-aba, now Akkerkuf, and Is, now Hit. The northern part of Accad is frequently termed Kar-Duniyas or Gan-Duni The country was intersected by a network of canals, the regulation
of which was under special officers. The tliree chief of those which
carried off the waters of the Euphrates to the Tigris above Babylon, were the Ar-malcha, entering the Tigris a little below Bagdad ; the Nahr-malcha, running across to the site of Seleukeia ; and the NahrKutha, which passed through Tel-Ibrahim. The Pallacopas, on the western side of the Euphrates, supplied an immense lake in the neighbourhood of Borsippa. On the same side, to the south of Babylon, is the fresh-water lake of Nedjef, suiTounded by sandstone
cliffs of considerable height, forty miles in length and thirty-five in
breadth at the broadest part. Below the lake the marshes where
Alexander nearly perished (Arrian, Exp. Al. vii. 22; Strabo, xvL 1, 12)
extend as far as the sea. Here, on the shores of the Persian Gulf,
lived the Caldai or Chaldeans, with their capital Bit-Yakin, when we first hear of them in the ninth century B.C. Under Merodach-baladan they made themselves masters of Babylonia, and gave their name to the whole country in the Greek period. Northward of the Caldai



362 APPENDIX II.
were the Gambulai and other nomad tribes, among whom the Arameans, Nabatheans, and Pukudu or Pekod, may be mentioned.
The fertility of the soil was great.: Pliny tells us {H. N. xviil 17) that wheat after being cut twice was good keep for sheep ; and
according to Berosos, wheat, barley, sesame, ochrys, palms, apples,
and many kinds of shelled fruit, grew wild. Indeed, wheat still does 80 in the neighbourhood of Anah, and we need not be surprised at the statement of Herodotos that grain commonly returned two hundredfold to the sower, and sometimes three hundredfold. Chaldea was the native country of the palm, the 360 uses of which were recounted by a Persian poem (Strabo, xvi. I, 14); and we learn from Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiv. 3) that from the point reached by Julian's army to the margin of the Persian Gulf was one continuous forest of
verdure.
As already stated, the primitive population of Babylonia and Assyria belonged to a race which may have been allied to the
Turanian or Finno-Tatar. At all events it spoke an agglutinative language which has many affinities with those of the Ural-Altaic family. This primitive population was supplanted by the Semites

the Casdim or " conquerors " of the Bible—at some unknown period before the second millennium B.C. The Semitic element, however, was stronger and purer in Assyria than in Babylonia, where it produced a mixed type, which was still further crossed by the Elamite
and Chaldean conquests. The Assjn'ian, on the other hand, displays
all the physical and moral characteristics of the Semitic race ; and while Babylonia was the home of culture and learning, Assyria
produced a breed of ferocious warriors and quick-witted traders.
History.—Until the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions our knowledge of Babylonian and Assyrian history was at once meagre
and uncertain. With the exception of Herodotos, whose notices were scanty and of doubtful value, we had to depend almost entirely on the
copyists and excerptists of Kt6sias and B6r6sos. KtSsias was a native of Knidos, and the physician of Artaxerxes Mn6m6n, but he seems to have been devoid of critical power. Portions of the annals compiled
by Persian writers were translated for him, and with the help of these
he endeavoured to destroy the credit of Herodotos as a historian. The
annals, however, like those of Firdusi or of later Arabic writers,
consisted for the most part of mere legendary tales and rationalised
myths ; we have, therefore, to seek in them not the history, but the mythology of the Babylonians. Semiramis was the goddess Istar, Ninos



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 363
the city of Nineveli, Ninyas or Zames the Sun-god. With these legends Ktesias mingled the Greek romance of Sardanapallos, and eked out his list of Assyrian kings with names partly imaginary, partly
geographical. Some of these were doubtless due to the translators on
whom he depended. In the later Persian period, however, Ktdsias becomes more trustworthy.
The work of Ber6sos was of a far different character. He was a priest of the temple of Bel at Babylon, and is said by Eusebios and Tatian to have been a contemporary of Alexander the Great, and to
have lived into the reign of Antiokhos S6ter. He had, therefore,
special opportunities of knowing the history and astronomy of his
country, upon which he wrote in Greek. Eecent discoveries have abundantly established the trustworthiness of this Manetho of
Babylonia, whose works, unfortunately, are known to us only through quotations at second and third hand. Since a cylinder of Antiokhos,
the son of Seleukos, has been found inscribed in Babylonian cuneiform, while bilingual fragments in cuneiform and cursive Greek of the
Seleukid age have also been discovered, and a contract tablet in Babylonian cuneiform, dated in the fifth year of the Parthian king, Pakoros, the contemporary of Domitian, exists in the Museum of Zurich, there is no reason why Berosos should not have been equally well acquainted with both the Greek language and the old literature of his native countr3^ And in spite of the fragmentary and corrupt state in which his fragments have come down to us, we now know that he was so. His account of the Deluge, for instance, agrees even
in its details with that of the cuneiform texts. Jos§phos seems to have known the original work of Ber6sos, but
the Christian writers quote him only indirectly through the compilation of Alexander Polyhistor (B.C. 80). Hence we can put no confidence in
the numbers attached to the dynasties in which B§r6sos, like his contemporarary, Manetho, arranged the list of Babylonian kings. His Arabian dynasty, for example, seems to correspond with the Cassito
dynasty of the inscriptions ; but if so, the title " Arabian " must be
corrupt, as well as the nine kings and 245 years assigned to it, since
we know of at least nineteen Cassite monarchs, and the length of time the dynasty lasted must have been over 600 years. Minor dynasties, again, have been either run together or omitted from the list, as a fragmentary tablet which once contained a complete catalogue
of legitimate Babylonian monarchs arranged in dynasties introduces a number of very short ones. This was probably the work of either



364 APPENDIX 11.
Polyhistor or his copyists ; at all events, the Assyrian dynasty of forty
five kings which is made to follow the Arabian one includes at least
two dynasties, that of the Assyrian conqueror Tiglath-Adar, which lasted only a few years, and that of the native princes, who succeeded in shaking off the Assyrian yoke and maintaining their independence
for more than four centuries.
Berdsos confined his attention to Babylonian history ; the history of Assyria seems to have been compiled by Megasthen^s in the time of Seleukos Nikator (B.C. 290), from Avhom (as Professor Schrader has shown) it was extracted by Abyddnos (B.C. 260). Abyd^nos in turn
survives only in the quotations of the Christian writers. But as Nineveh and its monuments had long been destroyed, the only sources Abydenos could have had for his history must have been the records
of Babylonia ; and it is not surprising, therefore, that the extracts we
possess from his work all relate to the period of the Second Assyrian Empire, when Babylonia was brought into close contact with the northern kingdom. The earlier period must have been for the most
part a mere blank, or else filled up with myth and legend.
One more classical authority for Babylonian history remains. This is the valuable Canon of Ptolemy, preserved in the Almagest, and giving the chronology of Babylon from B.C. 747 downwards. It probably came from B^r6sos. Other classical notices of Assyro- Babylonian
history may be passed over ; like those of Diodoros, they are little
more than echoes of Kt^sias. It is only the Old Testament which
gives us fuller and more trustworthy information.
It is, therefore, to the native texts that we have mainly to look for the history of Assyria and Babylonia. These are partly contemporaneous with the events they record, partly more recent compilations. The
statements of those that are contemporaneous may be frankly accepted, due allowance being made for oriental exaggeration and tendency to self
praise. The Assyrian historical documents, however, are singularly
free from these faults. They were intended to be read by a large and
well-educated public, and the practical character of the Assyrians made
them realistic in style. The historical inscriptions are scmpulous in
recording the names, and if possible the parentage, of the foreign
princes whom they mention ; every small town is carefully noted by name, and the numbers, whether of conquered populations and spoil,
or of the Assyrian armies, are seldom round and never excessive. Even
the disaster which befell Sennacherib —the least trustworthy of all the
royal authors—in Palestine is not denied or glossed over j it is simply

omitted, leaving a break which presupposes it Of course, the same
accuracy or trustworthiness cannot be expected in later compilations, and many of these, like the legend of Sargon of AgadS, merely embody popular tales. But such legends belong rather to Babylonia than to
Assyria, where the historical sense was really remarkably developed, and the extreme faithfulness with which old documents were copied inspires us with confidence in the statements made regarding them. The Assyrians early possessed a fixed chronology, reckoned by the
names of officers called limmi, who were changed every year, and, like the eponymous archons at Athens, gave their name to their year of
office. The chief events of each year were added to the name of its eponym, and in the earlier period of the empire the king himself
assumed the office in his year of accession. We possess fragments of
several editions of the Canon in which the names of the eponyms were recorded in order, and thus have an exact chronology of the empire from B.C. 913 to B.C. 659. Since the inscription of Rimmon-nirari I. is dated in the eponymy of Shalman-karradu, it is clear that the
system of dating by eponyms was already in existence in the fourteenth century B.C.; and we may therefore trust Sennacherib when he asserts
that a seal which belonged to Tiglath-Adar was carried off to Babylon 600 years before his own capture of that city, and that 418 years had elapsed between his invasion of Babylonia in B.C. 692 and the defeat of
Tiglath-Pileser I. by the Babylonians ; or this same Tiglath-Pileser, when he tells us that Samas-Rimmon had built the temple of Anu and Rimmon at Kalah-Sherghat 701 years before his own restoration of it. The system of eponyms, however, seems to have been confined to Assyria, and the early Chaldeans do not appear to have had any settled
system of chronology. Their inscriptions, if dated at all, are dated by
such events as the capture of a city or an inundation of the river.
Still they must have had some more definite mode of counting time,
since Assur-bani-pal affirms that Cudur-Nankhundi, the Elamite, had oppressed Accad 1635 years before his own conquest of Shushan
;
while the table of Babylonian dynasties, first discovered by Mr.
Smith, assigns to each king the length of his reign in years, months, and days. It must have been some such table as this which was used by Berdsos. It is unfortunate that only fragments of this table are preserved, as our acquaintance with early Babylonian history and chronology is extremely meagre and uncertain, and has to be gathered chiefly from the brick-legends of the early kings or stray notices in
later inscriptions. An inscription of Assyrian origin which gives brief



366 APPENDIX II.
notices of the occasions on which the monarchs of Assyria and Babylonia had come into contact with each other since the reigns of
Assur-bil-nisi-su and Cara-indas is useful, since our knowledge of Assyrian chronology enables us to tabulate the Babylonian kings mentioned in the text. It is only with the era of Nabonasar (B.C. 747),
and the mutual help afforded by the Assyrian inscriptions and the Canon of Ptolemy, that an exact chronology of Babylonia begins. For the empire of Nebuchadrezzar the records of the Egibi banking firm
are invaluable— dated deeds extending, year by year, from the reign of
Nebuchadrezzar to the close of that of Darius Hystaspis.
The history of Babylonia, like that of most great nations, begins with myth. Ten kings reigned over the country before the Deluge,
their reigns lasting for 120 sari, or 432,000 years. The chronology as well as the number of reigns has a purely astronomical origin : the
origin of the names has yet to be discovered. The first of these antediluvian kings was Aloros of Babylon, which indicates the Baby
lonian parentage of the whole story. Aloros took the title of " shep
herd," a title which we find assumed by the early Chaldean princes,
and which, like the Troifir^v Aawi/ of Homer, proves the pastoral habits
of the people before they became civilised citizens. The second successor of Aloros, Amnion, came from Pantibibla or Booktown,
possibly Sippara, as did also Daonus, the Dun or " mighty one " of the
inscriptions. Otiartes, which the native name Ubara-Tutu, "servant
of the Setting Sun," shows must be corrected to Opartes, was the ninth of the line, and belonged to Larankha, the Surippak of the texts. His son and successor was Xisuthros, the hero of the Deluge. With the Deluge the mythical history of Babylonia takes a new departure. From this event to the Persian conquest was a ]>eriod of
36,000 years, or an astronomical cycle called saros.^ Xisuthros, with
his family and friends, alone survived the waters which drowned the rest of mankind on account of their sins. He had been ordered by the gods to build a ship, to pitch it within and without, and to stock
it with animals of every species. Xisuthros sent out first a dove, then a swallow, and lastly a raven, to discover whether the earth was dry
;
the dove and the swallow returned to the ship, and it was only when the raven flew away that the rescued hero ventured to leave his ark. He found that he had been stranded on the peak of the mountain of

Nizir, " the mountain of the world," whereon the Accadians believed
the heaven to rest, —where, too, they placed the habitation of their gods
and the cradle of their own race. Since Nizir lay among the mountains of Pir Mam, a little south of Rowandiz, its mountain must bo
identified with Rowandiz itself. On its peak Xisuthros oflfered sacrifices, piling up cups of wine by sevens ; and the rainbow, " the glory of Anu," appeared in heaven, in covenant that the world should never again be destroyed by a flood. Immediately afterwards Xisuthros and his wife, like the biblical Enoch, were translated
to the regions of the blessed beyond Datilla, the river of death, and
his people made their way westward to Sippara. Here they disinterred the books buried by their late ruler before the Deluge had taken
place, and re-established themselves in their old country under the government first of Evekhoos, and then of his son Khomasbolos. Meanwhile other colonists had arrived in the plain of Sumer, and here,
under the leadership of the giant Etana, called Titan by the Greek
writers, they built a city of brick, and essayed to erect a tower by means of which they might scale the sky, and so win for themselves the immortality granted to Xisuthros. The spot where the tower was raised was the mound at Babylon, now known as the Amrdm, where stood the temple of Anu, the palace of the kings, and the hanging gardens of Nebuchadrezzar, and the season they chose for building it was the autumnal equinox. But the tower was overthrown in the night by the winds, and Bel frustrated their purpose by confounding
their language, and scattering them on the mound. Hence the place was called "the gate of God," though a later punning etymology connected it with h&lal, " to confound." Now happened the war waged by Etana, Bel, Prometheus, and Ogygos, against Kronos or Hea, and the adventures of the giant Ner, who, along with Etana, finally found a seat among the crowned heads in the underworld of Hades. Now, too, the goddess Istar descended
from heaven to woo the sons of men ;—Alala, the wild eagle, the lion
son of 'Silele ; Isullanu, the woodsman ; and above all, Tammuz, the young and beautiful Sun-god, the AdSnis of Semitic and Greek story. Slain by the boar's tusk of winter, Tammuz sank to the underworld, whither he was followed by Istar, and not released till he had drimk of the waters of life. More famous even than Tammuz, however, was the solar hero whose name is provisionally read Gisdhubar, and who has been identified with the biblical Nimrod. Gisdhubar was the prototype of the Melkarth of Tyre and the Herakles of Greece, and



368 APPENDIX II.
the twelve labours of Herakles may be traced back to the adventures of Gisdhubar, as recorded in the twelve books of the great Epic of early Chaldea. The Epic, whose authorship was ascribed to one Sin
lici-unnini, was preserved in the library of Erech, a city with which
Gisdhubar was specially associated, though his birthplace was supposed
to be Amarda, the city of " solar glory." Its date may be roughly
ascribed to about B.C. 2000, but it belongs to the period when the Semitic race was already in possession of the land.
The Semitic conquest must have been a gradual one. The evidence of language shows that when the Semites first came into contact with
the civilisation of Accad, they were mere desert-nomads, dwelling in
tents, and wanting even the first elements of culture. These, however, they soon acquired from their neighbours, and with the trading
instinct of their race quickly made themselves indispensable to the agricultural Accadiana Ur and the other towns on the western bank
of the Euphrates were the earliest places in which they settled, but they soon overflowed into the whole plain of Sumer. The oldest con
temporaneous records we possess are those of Lig-Bagas or Ur-Bagas, king of Ur, whose rule extended over the whole of both Accad and Sumer. The great temple of the Moon-god at Ur was founded by him, and he adorned Erech, Nipur, Lar'sa, and other cities, with
temples of vast size dedicated to the Sun, to Istar, and to Bel. Vice
roys were established in different parts of the country ; Khassimir was the governor of Nipur ; and Gudea, the grandson of Lig-Bagas, ruled
at Zerghul, where the statue of his architect has lately been found. Lig-Bagas seems to have been the first of the great Babylonian
builders, and the enormous brick structures he has left behind,
cemented with bitumen in the place of lime, show that architectural knowledge was already advanced. Buttresses, drains, and external ornamentation are all freely employed. The cuneiform system of writing had attained its full development ; libraries, stocked with clay
books, existed in the towns, signet stones were carved with artistic
skill, and the country was intersected by canals and roads. The amount of human labour at the disposal of the monarch may be judged from the fact that the Bowariyeh mound at Warka, which covers the ruins of the temple of the Sun-god, is 200 feet square and 100 feet high, so that above 30,000,000 of bricks must have been used in building it. The calendar was already fixed and regulated, and the
towers attached to the temples were used as observatories. According to Nabonidos, Lig-Bagas lived 700 years before the age of Khammuragas.



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 369
His son and successor was Dungi, " the mighty one." Among his
Accadian inscriptions he has left us a short one in Semitic, — a proof of the importance to which the Semites had now attained. They had in fact become a commercial aristocracy, and the time was not far distant when this commercial aristocracy would usurp the supreme power. It is difficult to know with which of the dynasties of B6r6so8 these
kings of Ur are to be identified. If the Arabian dynasty is that founded by Khammuragas, they ought to belong to the nameless dynasty which followed the eight " Median " kings. These Medes, it may be observed, must have taken their name from the Accadian
moAia, " country," and may possibly have come from Sumer, often called Kingi, " the land." In this case the capture of Babylon by them would represent the overthrow of a local line of princes who held sway in
that city.
The unification of the country under Lig-Bagas and Dungi was of short duration. It soon broke up again into small independent states. -When Cudur-nankhundi, the powerful Elamite monarch, invaded Baby-Ionia he seems to have found kings with Semitic names reigning there
;
but the book of Genesis represents another Elamite conqueror, Chedorlaomer or Cudur-Lagamar, as dominating over two Babylonian princes, Amar-phel of Sumer, and Arioch of Lar sa, as well as over a king of
Gutium. It is curious that the inscriptions contain a record of a second Eri-Acu or Arioch, king of Lar'sa, who was son and vassal of an
Elamite sovereign, Cudur-Mabug; and it is still more curious that just as Cudur-Lagamar extended his power to Palestine according to
Genesis,, Cudur-Mabug also styles himself " the citizen of Phoenicia." The power of Cudur-Mabug and his son Eri-Acu, however, did not extend over the whole of Chaldea, though Eri-Acu (or Rim-Agu, as he also calls himself) claimed to be " king of Sumer and Accad." Accad, however, including Babylon, was in the possession of a Semitic dynasty, whose capital was Agad6. The most brilliant representative of this dynasty was Sargon I., whose patronage of learning caused the library of Agad6 to become one of the most famous in Babylonia. It was for him that the great work on astronomy and astrology was compiled in seventy-two books, which Berdsos translated into Greek, and another work on terrestrial omens was also compiled for the same monarch. Legends naturally gathered round the name of this Babylonian Solomon. Not only was he entitled " the deviser of law, the
deviser of prosperity," but it was told of him how his father had died while he was still unborn, how his mother had fled to the mountains 2B



370 APPENDIX II.
and there left him, like a second Moses, to the care of the river in an ark of reeds and bitumen ; and how he was saved by Acci, " the water-drawer," who brought him up as his own son, until the time came when, under the protection of Istar, his rank was discovered, and
he took his seat on the throne of his forefathers. It is indeed possible
that Sargon was a usurper, since his name means "the constituted
king," and seems as if it had been assumed after his accession to power. However this may be, he was a conqueror as well as a legislator and friend of literature. More than once he attacked the Elamites successfully, though he was unable tg wrest Sumer out of
their hands. He made several campaigns against Syria and Palestine,
in the course of which he crossed into Cyprus, and there, as on the opposite shores of the mainland, he caused images of himself to be erected. These campaigns occupied three years, and it was to them that the influence of Babylonian culture upon the populations of the eastern basin of the Mediterranean must first be traced. Towards the end of his life he even penetrated as far as Maganna, or the peninsula
of Sinai, in quest, no doubt, of the turquoise and copper mines that
had so long been worked there by the Egyptians. It is perhaps to
these expeditions that Manetho refers when he asserts that the
Hyksos fortified Jerusalem for fear of the Assyrians. After over
throwing Kastubila of Cazalla, and quelling an insurrection which broke out among " the elders " of Accad, Sargon ended his long reign
of fifty-four years, and Avas succeeded by his son, Naram-Sin, who maintained the military fame of his father by conquering Ris-Rimmon of Apirak and marching into Maganna. A Babylonian cylinder, in which the title of divinity is given to Naram-Sin, was found by General di Cesnola in the treasury of the Cyprian temple of Kurion, and not only shows that apotheosis was not unknown in Babylonia,
but also that the influence of the kings of Agad6 was still strong in
the far west. But the reign of this deified king ended after all in disaster. The conquest of Maganna seems to have brought the dynasty of Sargon under Egyptian influence, to which the apotheosis of his son may perhaps be traced. At all events in Agad6, as in
Egypt, it became possible for a woman to be at the head of the state,
and Naram-Sin Avas followed by a queen, Ellat-Gula, But a custom which suited Egypt did not equally suit the Semites of Babylonia, and
Ellat-Gula was the last of her race. A horde of Cassites or Kossaeans swept down from the mountains of Northern Elam under their leader, Khammuragas ; Accad was conquered, a foreign dynasty established



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 371
in the land, and tlie capital transferred from Agad^ to Babylon. Babylon now became a city of importance for the first time ; the rank
assigned to it in the mythical age was but a reflection of the position
it held after the Cassite conquest. The Cassite dynasty is probably the Arabian dynasty of Berfisos, though if so, as has already been noted, the number of kings included
in it, as well as the length of their united reigns, must be largely
increased. We shall not be far wrong in placing its rise about B,C.
2000.^ The first care of Khammuragas, after establishing himself in
Accad, was to extend his sway over the southern kingdom of Sumer as well. Rim-Agu or Arioch was now on the throne, and after the conquest of Karrak and Duran, which gave him possession of the marches and the whole country as far as the shores of the Persian
Gulf, he claimed the imperial title of " king of Sumer and Accad,"
a
title, however, to which he had no right. He filled Ur, which at one
time had been subject to the princes of Karrak, as well as other cities,
with public buildings, though his capital was fixed at Lar'sa. With
the help of his Elamite allies he succeeded in repulsing the first attack of the Cassite invader; but a second attack proved too strong for him; the forces of Elam and Sumer were overthrown, and Khammuragas became king of the whole of Babylonia, From this time onward the country remained a united monarchy.
The Cassite dynasty must have lasted for several centuries, and probably included more than one line of kings. At any rate it is
otherwise difficult to find a place for a Cassite dynasty which traced its
descent from the god Sukamuna, and one of whose kings, Agu-kak-rimi, the son of Tassi-gurumas, has left us a long inscription, unless we throw it back into the period that preceded the era of Sargon of Agad6, and identify it with the Median dynasty of B6r6sos. It is certainly noticeable that Agu-kak-rimi calls himself king of Accad and Babylon only, not of Sumer. However this may be, it was under the Cassite
dynasty that the kingdom of Assyria first took its rise,—partly,
perhaps, in consequence of the Asiatic conquests of the Egyptian monarchs of the eighteenth dynasty. Later legends ascribed the foundation of the kingdom to the Moon-god, while Sargon boasts of " the 350 kings " who had preceded him and had " sent forth the people of the land of Bel"; but Assyria was but a portion of the empire of Gutium in the age of Cudur-Lagamar, and the earliest

372 APPENDIX II.
Assyrian princes of whom we know were merely petty rulers of Assur,
the original capital of Assyria, from which it derived its name. One of these rulers was Samas-Rimmon, the son of Ismi-Dagon, who built the temple of Anu and Rimmou at Assur, and whose date is fixed at B.C. 1820 by an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I. It was not till long
afterwards that "the kingdom was founded" by Bel-sumeli-kapi, and
the chieftains of Assur became kings of Assyria. From this time
forward, however, their power continued steadily to grow ; Assur-zaciresir and Adar-tukul-Assur even ventured to contend with Babylonia, and in B.C. 1400 the Cassite king married an Assyrian princess. Her son Kara-Murdas was murdered by the party opposed to Assyrian influence, but the usurper, Nazi-bugas, was quickly overthrown by the
Assyrians, who placed a vassal-prince on the throne. This event may
be considered the turning-point in the history of the kingdoms of the Tigris and Euphrates ; Assyria henceforth takes the place of the
worn-out monarchy of Babylonia, and plays the chief part in the
aff"airs of Western Asia until the day of its final fall. In little more
than a hundred years later the Assyrians were again in Babylonia, but this time as avowed enemies to all parties alike ; Babylon was captured by the Assyrian monarch Tiglath-Adar in B.C. 1270, and the
rule of the Cassite dynasty came to an end. But the avenger was at hand. Hardly was Tiglath-Adar dead when the Hittites assailed the Assyrian empire on the north and west, and the Babylonians seized the opportunity to make themselves free. The new line of Babylonian sovereigns, however,
was Semitic in name and race. It lasted a short time only. The
country was divided both in nationality and in interests. Civil wars
distracted the kingdom, and shortlived dynasties were founded by the non-Semitic tribes of the sea-coast or the Semitic inhabitants of the
great cities. The adherents of the old Cassite dynasty, as well as the
partisans of Assyria, contrived from time to time to place a nominee of their own upon the throne ; while the Elamites on the east and the Assyrians on the north were perpetually at war with the unhappy
kingdom, or else intriguing in its midst. Tlie literature and culture of
Babylonia migrated into Assyria, where kings whose real delight was in war and hunting affected to patronise learning and encourage horticulture. The most eminent among these was Tiglath-Pileser I. He carried his arms as far as Kilikia and the Mediterranean, shattered
the power of the Hittites and their kinsmen in the north, swept the
wild district of Kurdistan, and in B.c. 1130, after a momentary



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 373
repulse at the hands of Merodach-iddin-akhi, the Babylonian king,
defeated his antagonist on the banks of the Lower Zab and ravaged Babylonia, capturing Sippara, Opis, and even Babylon, the capital, itself Merodach-iddin-akhi saved himself by a timely submission
;
but a desultory war continued between his successors and Assur-bel
kala, the son of Tiglath-Pileser.
After this Assyria sinks for a while below the horizon of history. Its power had been founded on the individual energy and military
skill of its monarchs, and vanished altogether under a feeble prince. Pethor, at the junction of the Sajur and Euphrates, along with the
adjacent territory, fell into the hands of the Hittites and Syrians
;
David was enabled to carry the Israelitish arms as far, as the banks of the Euphrates ; and Assyria itself was overrun by the victorious armies of the Babylonian king, Sibir. Once more, however, it revived under Assur-dayan XL, whose son, Rimmon-nirari II. (b.C. 911-889), and great-grandson, Assur-natsir-pal (b.c. 883-858), made the name of
Assyria again terrible to the surrounding nations. Assur-natsir-pal was the most brutal and ferocious of even the Assyrian kings ; but he was also an energetic warrior and a great conqueror. The limits of his empire exceeded those of Tiglath-Pileser I. ; Kurdistan, Armenia, and Mesopotamia were traversed by his armies again and again, and his image was sculptured on the rocks at the sources of the Tigris by
the side of those of Tiglath-Pileser I. and his own father, TiglathAdar II. Nizir and its mountains, where the ark of the Chaldean Noah had rested, were overrun and ravaged, and the footsteps of the Assyrian conqueror were marked by impalements, by pyramids of human heads, and by unspeakable barbarities. Nebo-bal-iddina of Babylon was defeated ; Sangara of Carchemish and his brother princes paid tribute, and on the shores of the Mediterranean Assur
natsir-pal received the submission and treasure of the rich and unwar
like cities of Phoenicia. But these distant raids produced little else
than misery abroad and accession of wealth to the royal treasury at home ; no attempt was made to hold the conquests thfit had been gained, or to compensate for the destruction of culture in the West by introducing into the rude regions of the East the borrowed civilisation
of Assyria. The cities of Assyria, nevertheless, were enriched with
the spoils of foreign victory. Splendid palaces, temples, and other
public buildings were erected, and adorned with elaborate sculptures and rich painting. Calah, which had been founded by Shalmaneser I.,
B.C. 1300, was rebuilt by Assur-natsir-pal, who made it his favourite



374 APPENDIX II.
residence, and established a library there. His successor was his son, Shalmaneser 11. , named probably after the founder of Calah. Shalmaneser II., whose long and prosperous reign of thirty-five years marks the climax of the First Assyrian Empire, inherited his
father's vigour and military talent, along with greater political ability
and appreciation of culture. His opening campaign was directed against the wild tribes of the north-east ; Arame of Van and the Minnians of Urumiyeh were next attacked ; and after them the Hittites of Carchemish and their allies, among whom Pikhirim of Kilikia may be mentioned. By the conquest of Tul-Barsip or BarsampsS, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, and the capture of
Pethor (now Tash-atan), the Assyrians regained possession of the ford
across the river, and in B.C. 854 came into conflict with Hamath. Here Shalmaneser found himself confronted by a confederacy of
western princes, under the leadership of Hadad-idri, or Hadadezer, of Damascus and Irkhulena of Hamath, whom a common danger had aroused to oppose the threatened advance of the Assyrian forces. But
the confederacy was shattered in the battle of Karkar or Aroer, in which, among others, Ahab of Israel took part with 2000 chariots and 10,000 infantry, and the Orontes was choked with the slain. The Assyrians, however, had themselves suffered so much that Shalmaneser was unable to follow up his victory, and two years afterwards turned his attention to Babylonia, which he invaded and
reduced to a state of vassalage, under the pretext of helping the
legitimate king, Merodach-suma-izcur, against his insurgent brother.
It is on this occasion that we first hear of the Caldai or Clialdeans,
whom the Assyrians found inhabiting the marshy district of the
Persian Gulf. After thus securing his frontier on the south, Shal
maneser again marched against Syria (b.c. 850). Tlie war lasted, at intervals, for eleven years, during which Hadadezer was succeeded by Hazael, and Shalmaneser obtained several barren victories, and claimed
others which a strict criticism must deny to him. In B.c. 842, how
ever, Hazael really suffered a decisive defeat on the heights of Shenir,
and his camp, along with 1121 chariots and 470 carriages, fell into the
hands of the Assyrians, who proceeded to besiege him in his capital, Damascus. But the siege was soon raised, though not before Jehu of Israel had sent tribute ; and after wasting the Hauran, Shalmanest i marched to Beyrout, and there carved an image of himself on the rocky promontory of Bahli-rasi, at the entrance to the Nahr el-Kclb. The defeat of Hazael had removed the only rival Assyria had to



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 376
fear. From this time forward Shalmaneser contented himself with
expeditions to distant regions, such as Phoenicia, Melit^ne, Kap
jiadokia, and Armenia, for the sake of exacting tribute. After B.C.
834 he ceased to command his troops in person, the tartan or general
in-chief, Dayan-Assur, taking his place. The infirmities of old age,
which had no doubt obliged him to take this step, further led to the
rebellion of his eldest son, Assur-dayan-pal, which troubled the last
days of the old king, and well nigh proved fatal to him. Twenty
seven cities, including Nineveh and Assur, which probably resented the preference shown to Calah, as well as numerous smaller towns,
declared for the pretender, and it was with considerable difficulty that the revolt was put down by Shalmaneser's second son, Samas-Rimmon, who shortly afterwards succeeded him. Samas-Rimmon (824-811),
and his son, Rimmon-nirari III. (811-782), fairly maintained the empire they had received, but their efforts were chiefly expended upon campaigns in Armenia, Media, and the neighbouring regions, from which we may perhaps infer that the wild tribes of the east had begun to infest the Assyrian frontier. Samas-Rimmon, however, also endeavoured to restore the supremacy of Assyria in Babylonia. Merodach-baladhsu-ikbi of Babylon and his allies were defeated with
great slaughter at Dur-Papsukul about B.C. 820, and eight years later
he succeeded in entering Babylon. Rimmon-nirari III. obliged
Mariha of Damascus to pay him tribute, as well as the Phoenicians,
Israelites, Edomites, and Philistines. But though the royal annals
show that the kings still led their armies out to battle year by year, it is plain that the power and vigour of the reigning dynasty were wearing out The campaigns were either resultless, or else were made for purely defensive purposes. The empire of Shalmaneser had melted away. A few more princes followed Rimmon-nirari III., and then in B.C. 763 an eclipse of the sun took place on the 15th of June,
and the city of Assur revolted. In B.C. 761 the revolt had spread to
Arrapakhitis, and two years later to Gozan. In B.C. 758 it was indeed stamped out in Assur, but the more distant provinces were lost.
Three years afterwards, Assur-nirari, the last of his line, ascended the
throne. His reign lasted only ten years. What was lefl of the Assyrian empire had been undermined by decay and discontent, the army finally declared against the monarch, and he and his dynasty fell
together. On the 30th of lyyar, or April, RC. 745, Pul or Pdros seized the vacant crown, and assumed the name of the ancient
conqueror, Tiglath-Pileser.



376 APPENDIX II.
With the accession of Tiglath-Pileser 11. the Second Assj'rian
Empire may be said to begin. This Second Empire differed essentially from the first. The usurper was an organiser as well as a conqueror, and sought for the first time in the history of Western Asia to give
his conquests a consolidated and permanent character. The conquered provinces were no longer loosely connected with the central power by the payment of tribute, which was refused as soon as the Assyrian armies were out of sight ; nor were the campaigns undertaken by the
kings of Nineveh mere raids, whose chief objects were prestige and plunder. The conquests of the Second Empire were made with a fixed
purpose, and in pursuance of a definite line of policy, and, once made, they were tenaciously preserved. The conquered nations became
subject provinces, governed, wherever possible, by Assyrian satraps
;
while turbulent populations were deported to some distant part of the
empire. Each province and capital city had its annual contribution
to the imperial treasury fixed and regulated ; and centralisation, with its attendant bureaucracy, superseded the old loose union of mutually
hostile states and towns. Tiglath-Pileser took good care that the revolts to which he owed the crown should for the future be impossible. To him is due the inauguration of the principle which was
afterwards applied by Darius Hystaspis with so much success to the
organisation of the Persian empire. The title to power which his
birth denied him was secured by the institutions he established. The Second Assyrian Empire Was essentially a commercial one. It was founded and maintained for the purpose of attracting the trade and wealth of Western Asia into Assyrian hands. The instincts of the warrior and crusader had made way for the more deeply-rooted trading instincts of the Semitic race. Tiie expeditions undertaken
against the barbarous tribes of the east and north were made solely for
the purpose of protecting the frontier and caravan roads, and of keep
ing the predatory excursions of the mountaineers in check. The
resources of the empire were really reserved for the subjugation
of Babylonia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, the rich and civilised
marts of the ancient world. It was to divert the stream of commerce into their new satrapy of Carchemish that the Assyrian monarchs endeavoured to destroy the merchant communities of Tyre and Sidon.
Babylonia was necessarily the first to feel the effects of the new
policy. Before six months were over Tiglath-Pileser was leading his
forces against the southern kingdom. The northern part of Babylonia was annexed to Assyria, and secured by a chain of fortresses. After



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 377
chastising the Kurds, the Assyrian king next turned westward, Sarduris of Armenia, at the head of a confederacy of northern princes, in vain essayed to bar his way. The confederacy was defeated in Komagen^, Arpad (now Tel Erfad) was captured, and all Syria lay at his feet. For the present he was content with exacting tribute from the Hittites, the Arameans, and the Phoenicians. Hamath, then in alliance with Uzziah of Judah, was conquered in 738, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian officers. For the first time
we find the system of deportation applied on a large scale. Three years later Sarduris of Ararat was again attacked, and the neighbourhood of his capital, Dhuspas or Tosp, now Van, was devastated over a space of 450 miles. Freed from any danger from the north, TiglathPileser now eagerly seized the opportunity of overthrowing the power
of Damascus offered by the request of the Jewish king, Ahaz, for protection from his Syrian and Israelitish enemies. Rezin was defeated and besieged in his capital, Damascus, in 734, and the whole country
far and near, including Samaria, Ammon, Moab, and the Philistines,
was reduced to subjection. At length, after a siege of two years,
Damascus surrendered, its inhabitants were enslaved, and Rezin was
put to death. Syria became an Assyrian province, and all the princes of the "West were summoned thither to do homage to the conqueror, while Tyre was fined 150 talents of gold, about £400,000. One of
the chief objects of Tiglath-Pileser's policy had thus been achieved. But Babylonia still remained- In B.C. 731, accordingly, the Assyrian armies again marched into Chaldea. Ukin-ziru, the Khin-ziros of
Ptolemy, was slain, Babylon and the other great cities were taken, and
in B.C. 729 Tiglath-Pileser assumed the imperial title of "King of Sumer and Accad." But he did not live long to enjoy his success. In B.C. 727 he died, probably without children, and Shalmaneser III., one of his generals, succeeded to his empire and his policy. Shalmaneser, however, failed to found a dynasty. After an unsuccessful attempt to capture Tyre, he died, or was murdered, during the siege of Samaria in B.C. 722, and the supreme power was seized by another general, who assumed the venerable name of Sargon, "the constituted king." Sargon claimed descent from two early kings, Bel-bani and Adasi, but his claim was probably admitted only by the flattery of a court. In B.C. 720 he took Samaria, and deported 27,200 of its leading inhabitants into Gozan and Media, the remainder being placed under an Assyrian governor. Meanwhile Sargon had been reminded that the



378 APPENDIX II.
work of Tiglath-Pileser had been but half accomplished. As long as Elam remained unconquered, it was always able to threaten Babylonia, and menace the flank of the Assyrian empire. Entrenched behind its mountains, however, and furnished with all the resources of an ancient civilisation, Elam was difficult to subdue, and its subjugation could
bring no profit to its conqueror. The news, therefore, that the Elamite king, Khumba-nigas, had invaded Babylonia was highly disturbing, but Sargon was obliged to content himself with simply driving the Elamites back Afi'airs in the west more imperatively claimed his attention. Here the weak point in the empire was, strangely enough, the little kingdom of Judah. But Judah was a mountainous country, its capital was almost impregnable, and its conquest, troublesome as it
would be, was valueless to the traders of Nineveh, At the same time it screened Egypt, whose Ethiopian conquerors endeavoured to defend themselves against the growing power of Assyria by stirring up
trouble in Palestine. Sargon's aim, therefore, was to inflict a blow upon the Egyptians without throwing away his strength on the barren conquest of Judah. He eff'ected his purpose by crushing the Philis
tines, and so making his way to the Egyptian frontier along the seacoast. The Egyptian army was defeated at Raphia in B.C. 720, and Sargon was satisfied with carrying the spoil of Hanun, king of Gaza, to
Nineveh. The last attempt of Syria to free itself, under the leadership of a Jew, Ilu-bihid or Yahu-bihid, had been already stamped out in fire and blood, and Hamath, where he had ruled, was colonised
with 4300 Assyrians. In 717 all was ripe for the final assault upon Carchemish (now Jerablfts), the wealthy capital of the once powerful
Hittites. The city was taken : its last monarch, Pisiris, with all his
treasures, fell into the hands of Sargon, and Assyria became mistress of the trade of Western Asia. Carchemish commanded the great caravan road from the East, and its satrap was one of the most important of
the Assyrian governors. From this time onward every effort was made to attract all the commerce of Asia to Carchemish : its maund became the standard weight of the empire, and no pains were spared
to destroy the rival trade of the Phoenicians. But the fall of Carchemish was not unavenged by the kindred population of the north. Mita of the Moschians, Ursa of Armenia, and their allies from the ranges of the Taurus, now fell upon the conqueror. The struggle was long and bitter, but at length Sargon prevailed. Van submitted, Armenia was ravaged, and Ursa, the leader of the coalition, committed suicide. The Assyrian forces penetrated



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 379
into the trackless mountains of distant Media ; Kilikia and the Tibar^ni were placed under an Assyrian governor, and the city of Malatiyeh was razed to the ground. Sargon could now turn to Palestine, Avhere Hezekiah of Judah, encouraged by Babylonia and Egypt, had refused to pay the tribute due to his Assyrian lord. But in 7 11 Sargon swept Phoenicia and Judah, Jerusalem was captured, and the Jewish
king compelled to submit. The suppression of the revolt in Palestine came none too soon. Aided by the Elamites, Yagina or Yugaeos, a Chaldean prince, had made himself master of Babylonia after Tiglath
Pileser's death, and the short campaign of Sargon in 721 did not prevent his son, Merodach-baladan, from succeeding to his power. For twelve years Merodach-baladan was undisturbed. But he knew well that the Assyrian king was only waiting to complete his work in
the east before asserting his claim to Babylonia. When, therefore, the coalition of the northern nations was breaking down before the Assyrian arms, the Babylonian king sent embassies to Judah and the neighbouring principalities, in order to concert measures of defence against the common enemy. Sargon, however, fell upon Palestine before either Babylonia or Egypt was ready to move, and when Merodach-baladan at last stirred he found himself single-handed face to face with the whole might of the Assyrian empire. The issue could not be doubtful, and though the Elamites hastened to his assistance he was driven first from Babylon, and then from the cities of the south.
His last refuge. Bit-Yagina in the marshes, was taken by storm in 709, and he himself was loaded with chains and sent to Nineveh. Sargon
now set Jiimself to obliterate all traces of the Chaldean usurpation.
The turbulent desert tribes, whom the late king had settled in Babylonia, were exterminated or expelled, and Sargon did his utmost
to ingratiate himself with the native priesthood. His coronation in Babylon was like the coronation of the German emperors at Rome,
and seemed to give him that title of legitimacy which was wanting in
his own country. In the following year his pride was gratified by the voluntary submission of Uperi of Dilvun, in the Persian Gulf, the sacred island of Accadian mythology, as well as of the Greek and Phoenician kings of Kypros, the island of Yavnan or the " lonians," where he caused a monument of himself to be erected at Kition or Larnaka, inscribed with pseudo-archaic cuneiform characters. It was
the first direct contact between Greek and Assyrian ; the culture of
Babylonia and Assyria had long since been indirectly leavening the Hellenic world, but the barrier that had existed between them was



380 APPENDIX II.
now broken down. The divided nationalities of Western Asia had been fused into the Assyrian empire, and Assyria had stepped into the place once occupied by Egypt in the history of mankind. Elam
was left the solitary rival of the new power in Asia, and the last
years of Sargon's life were spent in a desultory war with it.
The political idea conceived by Tiglath-Pileser was thus realised, '^gyptj it is true, was still unconquered, but for how long depended
on the energy and ability of Sargon's successors. At first, however, these seemed to be wanting. The fierce old king was murdered in his new city of Dur-Sargina or Khorsabad, and succeeded by his son Sennacherib on the 12th of Ab (July), B.C. 705. Brought up in the
purple, Sennacherib had none of his father's virtues or talents. Vain
glorious, tyrannical, and weak, he owed the preservation of the empire that had been bequeathed to him rather to the thoroughness with which all elements of opposition had been crushed than to any
efforts of his own. The boastful style of his inscriptions contrasts
sharply with the plain simplicity of his father's, and makes it needful
to examine carefully the accuracy of their contents. Merodach-baladan had escaped from captivity, and the death of
Sargon was the signal for a fresh attempt on his part to establish himself at Babylon. But a battle at Kis again drove him from the country, and Sennacherib found himself free to devastate EUip (in the neighbourhood of the modern Elwend). Then he fell upon Phoenicia
(B.C. 701). Zidon and other cities were captured, and the Phoenician
king, Lulia or Elulseus, forced to take refuge in Kypros. The turn of Judah came next. Hezekiah's allies in Askalon and Ekron were severely punished ; the Jewish towns, with a great quantity of spoil and captives, were taken; and the Jewish king himself sought for
giveness by the gift of 30 talents of gold, 300 talents of silver,
precious stones, couches of ivory, tusks of wild bulls, dancing girls and eunuchs, and male and female musicians. But Sennacherib refused to be appeased, and the siege of Jerusalem was determined upon. Then came the disaster to the Assyrian arms, which Egyptian
legend ascribed to the piety of their own priest-king Sethos. As a matter of fact, Sennacherib claims to have defeated Tirhakah of Egypt at Eltekeh, when the latter came to the help of Hezekiah ; but as he did not pursue his success, it is probable that he lost as much as he gained. Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 381
One cause of this was the unquiet state of Babylonia, which could not forget that the power that claimed supremacy over her was a mere parvenu. The year after the campaign in Palestine (700 B.C.), a Chaldean named Suzub stirred up revolt, which Sennacherib had some difficulty
in suppressing. Merodach-baladan and his followers had settled at
the mouth of the Eulseus, and in 697 Sennacherib found it necessary to have a fleet built and manned by lonians and Phoenicians in the Persian Gulf, by means of which he destroyed the Chaldean settlement. But Suzub, with the help of the Elamites, had excited an insurrection in his rear, which was, however, put down by the Assyrian generals, who captured Suzub and sacked the ancient city of Erech. Meanwhile Sennacherib made an unsuccessful attempt to invade Elam, and Suzub, having escaped from Assyria and been admitted into Babylon, in 692 added his forces to those of Elam, Media, and other eastern allies. But the decisive battle of Khalule shattered the hopes
of the confederate princes ; Babylon was besieged and captured the
following year, and then given to the flames. Its inhabitants were sold into slavery, and the river Arakhtu or Araxes was choked with its ruins. If, however, we may judge from the interregnum which marks the last eight years of Sennacherib's reign in Ptolemy's Canon, Chaldea refused to acknowledge the Assyrian domination up to the day of his death. The barbarous destruction of the venerable city of Babylon must have aroused against him the horror of every inhabitant of the southern kingdom. It was the last political achievement of Sennacherib of which we know. The latter years of his life seem to have been spent in
inactivity, or else in constructing canals and aqueducts in Assyria, in
embanking the Tigris, and in building himself a palace at Nineveh on a grander scale than had ever been attempted before. His
partiality for his younger son Esar-haddon excited the jealousy of the two elder ones, Adrammelech and Nergal - sharezer, who murdered their father in the month Tebet (December), B.C. 681, while Esar-haddon was conducting a campaign against the Armenians. The forces of Esar-haddon's brothers, however, proved no match for the veterans he commanded, and a battle fought near Malatiyeh in December, B.C. 681, established him on the throne and compelled his brothers to take refuge in Armenia. Esar-haddon entered Nineveh the following month, and immediately afterwards started for Babylonia, where Ur was soon taken, and the surviving son of Merodach-baladan compelled to sue for his life. The conqueror pre



382 APPENDIX II.
sented him with the government of his ancestral kingdom, and then
turned to the restoration of Babylon, rebuilding its walls and temples,
and bringing back its captured deities, its plunder, and its people. Henceforward Babylon became the second capital of the empire, the Assyrian court residing alternately there and at Nineveh. The event
quickly showed the wise policy of this measure of conciliation.
Esar-haddon's reign, in fact, is characterised throughout by keen
political tact His political sagacity was equal to the high military talents which enabled him to complete the fabric of the Second Empire by the conquest of Egypt. His disposition, too, was unusually mild and humane for an Assyrian prince, and his powers of conciliation enabled him to consolidate what his military genius had won. One of his most remarkable achievements was his expedition into the heart of Arabia, where he penetrated to the kingdoms of Huz and Buz, 980 miles distant from Nineveh, 280 miles of the march being through
arid desert. The feat has never since been excelled, and the terror
inspired by it among the desert tribes was such that the country
adjoining them was for the first time rendered safe. In the north, too, the Assyrian army penetrated almost equally far. Here Teispes the Kimmerian was defeated between the Zagros and Niphates, and thrown with his hordes westward into Asia Minor, while the copper
mines in the eastern frontiers of Media—the very name of which had
hitherto been barely known—were occupied and worked. This part of the country was already inhabited by Aryan Medes, and the great Semitic empire accordingly found itself in contact on both east and west with an Aryan population, and with those small independent
states which seemed the natural political organisation of the Aryan
race. Among the twenty-two kings who sent materials for the palace of Esar-haddon at Nineveh were some Kjrprian ones with Greek names. Greeks and Medes were thus divided only by a single empire. The day was preparing when the barrier should be removed, and the great struggle of Asiatic and European Aryan was to commence. Early in his reign Esar-haddon had taken good care to pick a
quarrel with Sidon. The city was destroyed, and its inhabitants
settled elsewhere, Tyre taking the place of Sidon as the chief city of
Phoenicia. But the trade of the Phoenicians was half ruined, and Carchemish and Nineveh were enriched at their expense. The con
quest of Egypt was alone left to be achieved. The revolt of Baal of Tyre furnished the opportunity. The Arabian king provided water for the Assyrian army in its march



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 383
ucross tho desert; Tirhakah was defeated, Memphis entered in triumpli, and Thebes compelled to open its gates. Egypt was divided into twenty satrapies, governed partly by Assyrians, partly by native vassal princes, who were, however, watched by a number of Assyrian
garrisons. Necho of Sais and Memphis headed the list of governors. On his return from the campaign, Esar-haddon associated Assur-bani
pal, the eldest of his four sons, with himself on the throne (on the 12th
of lyyar or April, B.c. 669), and died two years afterwards. Assur
bani-pal's first act was to appoint his brother, Saul-sum-yukin or Sammughes, viceroy of Babylon. Assur-bani-pal, the Sardanapalus of the Greeks, to whom he became known through the medium of Lydia, was the "grand monarque " of AssjTia. Ambitious and luxurious, he was a munificent patron of literature and art, and while recognising his own
military incapacity, selected able generals, who extended and maintained his empire. After the conquest of Elam, which took place during his reign, the Assyrian empire reached its final limits ; but it had within it the elements of decay, and the pride and ambition of the monarch brought about the coalition which robbed him of Egypt, and well-nigh shattered the whole empire. The court set an example of
costly magnificence, of cultivated luxury, and of learned antiquarianism,
and Assyrian literature entered upon its Alexandrine stage.
Assur-bani-pal found Egypt in a state of revolt. Two campaigns
were requisite to quell it, to drive Tirhakah back to the domains of
his ancestors, and to destroy Thebes. Meanwhile, the siege of Tyre,
begun before Esar-haddon's death, was closely pressed. The Tyrians at last aubmitted ; their king and his brothers had to send their daughters to the harem of the Assyrian monarch, while Tubal and Kilikia also owned the supremacy of Nineveh. The name of the great king spread to the extreme west of Asia Minor, and Gugu or Gyges of Lydia voluntarily sent him tribute, including two Eammerian chiefs whom the Lydian prince had captured with his own hand. The submission of Gyges was ascribed to a dream ; more probably Gyges trusted to Assyria for defence against the adherents of the dynasty he had displaced, and the Kimmerian hordes that menaced him from without.
But Gyges soon discovered that the friendship of Nineveh was a burden rather than a gain. The Assyrian empire was threatening to
swallow up all the East. Elam, the last civilised kingdom of the old
world which had held out, had finally fallen after a long struggle



384 APPENDIX II.
before the arms of the Assyrian generals, who had been aided by
internal dissensions ; and Umman-igas, its titular sovereign, was really
little else than an Assyrian viceroy. But in B.C. 652 the blow was struck which eventually led to the overthrow of the whole empire. A
general insurrection broke out, headed by Assur-bani-pal's brother, the viceroy of Babylon, in the east, and by Psammetikhos of Sais, the son of Necho, in the west. Elam, Babylonia, Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Lydia, made common cause against the oppressor. Aided by the Ionian and Karian mercenaries sent by Gyges, Psammetikhos succeeded in shaking off the Assyrian yoke ; Assur-bani-pal, in fact, was too
much occupied nearer home to think any longer of so distant a province. His agents in Babylonia had forewarned him of the
threatened insurrection there, but his natural indolence inclined him
to disregard them till the event actually took place. With great difficulty the revolt was crushed ; Babylon and Cuthah were reduced by famine in 649, and Sammughes burnt himself to death in his palace. The wandering tribes of Northern Arabia, Kedar, Zobah,
Nabathsea, etc., were chastised, and fire and sword were carried through Elam. Umman-aldas, the last king of Elam, fled to the mountains, the ancient capital of Shushan was plundered and razed, and the whole of Susiania was reduced to a wilderness. Babylonia was thus avenged for its many invasions upon the country whence its
civilisation had originally come. Its union with Assyria now became closer than before. Assurbani-pal would trust no more viceroys. Kandalanu, who appears as king of Babylon in Ptolemy's list, was a mere subordinate officer, and a prefect of Babylon is one of the Assyrian eponyms in the later years of Assur-bani-pal's reign. The date of the Assyrian king's death is uncertain, as well as the number of kings who intervened between him and the last, Esar-haddon II., the Sarakos of Ber6sos. After his death, however, the viceroys of Babylonia again began to extend their power ; and one of them, Nabopolassar, made himself independent in B.C. 625.
Shorn of its empire, Assyria lasted for a few years longer, but its end was near. The storm at last fell upon it from the north. Kaztarit,
king of Media and Caru-cassi ; Mamit-arsu, " lord of the city of the Medes;" the Kimmerians, the Minni, and the people of 'Saparda,*
united their forces against it ; the frontier cities fell first ; and though
Esar-haddon proclaimed public fasts and prayers to the gods, Nineveh
» Or Sepharad (Obadiah 20).



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 386
itself was besieged, captured, and utterly destroyed. The Assyrian empire was now shared between Media and Babylon. Nabu-cudur-utsur or Nebuchadrezzar, Nabopolassar's eldest son, was the real founder of the Babylonian empire. The attempt of Pharaoh Necho to win for Egypt the inheritance of Assyria was overthrown at the battle of Carchemish, and when Nebuchadrezzar succeeded his father in B.C. 604, he found himself the undisputed lord
of Western Asia. Palestine was coerced in 602, and the destruction of Jerusalem in 687 laid a way open for the invasion of Egypt, which took place twenty years later. Tyre also underwent a long siege of
thirteen years, but it is doubtful whether it was taken after all.
Babylon was now enriched with the spoils of foreign conquest. It owed as much to Nebuchadrezzar as Rome owed to Augustus. The buildings and walls with which it was adorned were worthy of the metropolis of the world. The palace, now represented by the
Kasr mound, was built in fifteen days, and the outermost of its three walls was seven miles in circuit. Hanging gardens were constructed for Queen Amytis, the daughter of the Median prince, and the great temple of Bel was roofed with cedar and overlaid with gold. The temple of the Seven Lights, dedicated to Nebo at Borsippa by an
early king, who had raised it to a height of forty-two cubits, was com
pleted, and various other temples were erected on a sumptuous scale both in Babylon and in the neighbouring cities, while new libraries
were established there. After a reign of forty-two years six months and twenty-one days, Nebuchadrezzar died (rc. 562), and left the crown to his son Evil-Merodach, who had a short and inactive reign of
three years and thirty -four days, when he was murdered by his
brother-in-law Nergal-sharezer, the Neriglissar of the Greeks. Nergal
sharezer calls himself the son of Bel-suma-iskun, " king of Babylon ;
"
he seems to have been Rab-mag at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem (Jer. xxxix. 3). The chief event of his reign of four years
and four months was the construction of a new palace. His son, who succeeded him, was a mere boy, and was murdered after a brief reign of four months. The power now passed from the house of Nabopo
lassar, —Nabu-nahid or Nabonidos, who was raised to the throne, being of another family. His reign lasted seventeen years and five months, and witnessed the end of the Babylonian empire. Recent discoveries have made us acquainted with the history of this event Nabonidos found a new power rising among the moun
tains of Elam. Aryan settlers had made their way across the deserts 2c



386 APPENDIX II.
of Sagartia, and penetrated as far as the rear of the Turanian population in Media and Susiana. Before the death of Nebuchadrezzar
half Media was Aryanised, and an Aryan tribe had established itself almost within sight of the Persian Gulf. This tribe subsequently became known under the name of Persian. After the overthrow of Elam by Assyria, and then of Assyria itself, there was nothing to bar its way to the occupation of the waste lands of the old empire of Anzan, and a portion of it accordingly occupied Susa. Early in the
reign of Nabonidos the recognised chief of the Susians was Kyros, who claimed descent from the Aryan clan of the Akhaemenids, but whose non-Aryan name may indicate that he was really of Elamite origin. Kyros had the abilities and the will to found an empire. Media was the first point of attack, then Babylonia. The newly-built city of
Ekbatana, constructed in imitation of Nebuchadrezzar's buildings at
Babylon, was the centre of a loosely-organised empire. Here a prince of the old race ruled over Protomedes and Aryan Medes alike,
though it is probable that the allegiance of the latter was doubtful
and scant. But the elements of weakness in Babylonia were almost as great as those in Media. Nabonidos was regarded as an usurper by a consider
able party, which included the priests and aristocracy. A hostile
people, the Jews, were planted in the very heart of the country, where,
contrary to the experience and expectation of their conquerors, they
had refused to amalgamate with the native population. That native
population itself consisted of ill-assorted elements—Semites, Chaldeans, and nomade tribes. The distant provinces of the empire could not be depended on ; that they were quiet was due rather to exhaustion than
to fear or loyalty. In fact, before the first year of Nabu-nahid's reign was over, he had to face two campaigns, the second against an insurgent named Khume. Hamath rose in rebellion the very next year, and the whole of B.C. 652 was spent by the Babylonian king in putting it down. In the sixth year of Nabonidos, B.C. 549, the Median monarchy fell. The army of Istuvegu or Astyages revolted against him while on the march against Kyros, and gave him into the hands of his enemy. Perhaps it was a revolt of the Aryan against the Protomede. Ekbatana was captured and plundered by Kyros, who spent the next few years in subduing the remains of the Median empire. After the capture of Arbela in B.C. 546, he overran what had once been the kingdom of Assyria, taking among other places Mespila (Muspilu) and Larissa or Resen (Xenophon, Anab. iil



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 387
4, 7-12), and then marched into Mesopotamia. Meanwhile Nabonidos had been taking measures to avert the coming attack. Babylon was made impregnable ; the river was paved with brick, and lined with huge walls ; and those wonderful works of defence were constructed which Herodotos ascribes to Queen Nitdkris. This queen may have been the mother of Nabonidos, who died on the 5th of Nisan or March, B.C. 546, in the camp near Sippara, where the king had stationed an army under the command of his eldest son, Belshazzar, to
prevent the attack of Kyros from the north.
The army successfully fulfilled its purpose. Foiled of his intention to force an entrance from the north, Kyros began to tamper with
the disaffected elements in the Babylonian population ; and in B.c. 639, when all was ready, he marched against Nabonidos from the
south-east. The Chaldeans on the coa^t revolted, and in the month Tammuz, or June, Kyros defeated the army of Nabonidos at Eutum. Immediately afterwards the people of Accad, or possibly the Jews settled there, revolted ; the Persians entered Sippara on the 1 4th of the month without fighting, and Nabonidos fled. Babylon opened its gates to the Persian general Gobryas, and Nabonidos was captured and put in chains. The only resistance made was by the Kurdish bodyguard, who barricaded themselves in the temple of Saggil at the end of the month, but they had no weapons. On the 3d of Marchesvan (October) Kyros entered Babylon in triumph, and the Babylonian empire was at an end. Eight days later Nabonidos died, and Kyros, whose political wisdom was equal to his military abilities, allowed
him to be buried sumptuously. The Persian prince, however, adopted other means also for winning the favour of his new subjects. The
temples were restored, the gods and their priests received large
offerings, and Kyros and his son Kambyses took part in the religious
processions, and styled themselves the servants of the gods Merodach and Nebo. The death of Kambyses inspired the Babylonians with the hope of recovering their independence. In B.C. 521 they revolted under Nadintu-Bel, the son of Aniru, who called himself Nebuchadrezzar, the son of Nabonidos. A portrait of him, in the Greek style, and with a Greek helmet, is carved on a cameo in the Berlin Museum. But Darius overthrew the pretender in two battles at Zazan, and pursued him into Babylon, which he closely besieged
(November, B.C. 521). The siege lasted nearly two years, but the Persians finally captured the city by diverting the Euphrates from its



388 APPENDIX II.
channel, and, after passing by night along the river-bed, entering it through an unguarded gate. It is this siege and capture which Hero
dotos transfers to the age of I^yros. Once more, in B.C. 515, a new impostor arose, Arakhu, the son of the Armenian Khaldita. He too claimed to be Nebuchadrezzar II., and he too was taken and executed in Babylon after a short siege.
Religion and Mythology. — The religion of Accad was originally
Shamanistic, like the religion of the Siberians or Samoyeds at the present day. Every object and force of Nature was supposed to have its zi or spirit, who could be controlled by the magical exorcisms of
the Shaman or sorcerer-priest. These spirits were good or bad, like
the objects and forces they represented, and like the latter, too, they were innumerable. Naturally the demons were supposed to outnumber the powers of good, and there was scarcely an action which did not risk demoniac possession. Diseases were all produced by their malevolence, and it was necessary to guard the house from
them by placing at its entrance the figure of a cherub or some similar composite creature, which was regarded as a good genius. Even the dead were believed sometimes to revisit the earth and devour the
living under the form of vampires. Gradually, certain of these spirits,
or rather deified forces of nature, were elevated above the rest into
the position of gods, more especially Anu " the sky," Mul-ge or Enum " the earth " and " under world," and Hea " the deep." But old
habits of thought were too strong to be resisted, and even these deities had each their zi attached to them. Before the arrival of the Semites a liturgy was already in the hands of the Accadians. This old prayer-book consisted of exorcisms
and magical formulae, interspersed with occasional hymns about the spirits or legends of their achievements, and ending with the words,
" Take oath, spirit of heaven ; take oath, spirit of earth." With the rise of a united monarchy, however, the gods began to assume importance and form themselves into a hierarchy. The worship of
special deities had become associated with special cities ; Ur was the
city of the Moon -god, Lar'sa of the Sun -god, Babylon of Merodach
;
and the supremacy of a city implied the supremacy of the deity it worshipped. The kings vied with each other in erecting temples to
these great divinities, whose vicegerents on earth they were, and those who were engaged in organising men below at the same time organised the gods above. The first monarch of all Chaldca of whom
we know is also the first great temple-builder.



I
BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 389
It was when Accadian religion had reached this stage that the Semite entered the land. Shamanism had developed into polytheism ; the sorcerer had become the priest. Along with the change had gone an ever-increasing tendency to solar worship. The sun and the daylight were the most potent powers of good that affected the early Chaldean, and when the spirits that were in Nature became the gods of Nature, the sun and the daylight were accordingly marked out for
special adoration. The supreme deity of several of the great cities was the Sun-god under varying forms ; Merodach of Babylon, for
instance, was but "the solar brilliance," who, with the rise of Baby
lon, was elevated to a chief ])lace in the Accadian pantheon. But there was another cause which aided the growth of sun-worship. The
age of political unification was also the age of the great outburst
of Accadian literature. Poets started up on all sides, and hymns innumerable were composed in honour of the new gods. In course of time these hymns were invested with a sacred character, and, like
the Rig-Veda in India, were arranged in a collection which shperseded
the old collection of magical exorcisms as the inspired liturgy of Chaldea. It was to the Sun, the great benefactor of mankind, that the majority of the hymns were addressed, and the attributes ascribed to the Sun -god, and the manifold names whereby he was invoked,
became so many new solar divinities. These in turn passed into solar heroes, as the names given to them and the human actions recounted of them gave rise to legends and myths. As long, however, as the Accadian domination lasted, the Sungod had a formidable rival in the Moon-god. The Chaldeans were emphatically a people of astronomers and astrologers, the result of
their early pastoral life on the mountains of Susiana, and the moon accordingly played the same part in their religion and mythology that the sun has done elsewhere. It was from the Moon-god that the monarchs traced their descent ; it was to him that the imperial city
of Ur was dedicated ; and in the hierarchical system of the priesthood the Moon-god was the father of the Sun-god. But the Semitic occupation of Babylonia turned the scale in favour of the latter. The
Semites, the children of the desert, made the sun the centre of their faith and worship ; as Baal he was the Supreme Being, now giving
life and light to his adorers, now scorching them with his fiery rays
and demanding the sacrifice of their nearest and dearest. As soon as the Semitic element in the population of Chaldea became strong, sun-worship began to absorb everything else. At the same time



390 APPENDIX II.
a new conception was introduced into the religion of the country. The Semites brought with them the idea of gender; each one of their male deities consequently had a female consort and reflection
at his side. Baal or Bel presupposed Baaltis or Bilat, Anu presupposed Anat. Hitherto Accadian belief knew only of one female
divinity, Istar, the goddess of war and love, the patroness of the
moon and the planet Venus, and there were as many Istars as there were centres of worship in the land. But Istar now became the feminine Astoreth ; her attributes were divided among the goddesses of Sippara, of Agad6, of Arbela, and other places; and though she continued to the last to retain an independent place by the side of the
great male divinities, there was a growing tendency to dissolve her into Beltis, the shadowy female double of BaaL Long before the second millennium B.c. the work of fusing the
religious ideas of the Accadian and the Semite together was completed. The Semite borrowed the old Accadian pantheon en bloc, classing the inferior gods among the 300 spirits of heaven and the 600 spirits of
earth, and superadding his own religious conceptions and his own
divinities. These were identified with the leading deities of the Chaldean creed ; Mul-ge, for example, becoming Bel, Tin-sar Nebo, and Utuki Samas. But the great majority of deities were adopted without change of either name or attributes, though the names were in
some cases slightly Semitised. This process of syncretism went along with a curious development
of astro-theology. The heavenly bodies, like all other objects in
Nature, had once had their special spirits ; when this old phase of
religion passed away, the spirits were replaced by the gods of the new
pantheon. The chief divinities were identified with the planets and other leading stars ; the sun and moon were already provided for. The state religion of Babylonia thus became a strange mixture of worn-out Accadian spirit-worship, of the Semitised later Accadian
hierarchy of gods, of Semitic religious conceptions, and of astro
theology.
To this mixture must be added the early ancestor-worship, which
still survived under various forms, and the cult paid to certain kings. This, however, was but a form of ancestor-worship, and may have been
due to Egyptian influence.
In the higher and more gifted minds the mixture led to monotheism. From resolving the gods of the Semitic nomad into the go<ls
of civilised Chaldea it needed but a step to resolve the gods of



I

Chaldea themselves into varying aspects of one supreme deity. Sir
H. Rawlinson believes that Eridu, the Paradisiacal city, was the chief seat of the monotheistic "sect ; " however that may be, we find hymns in the sacred collection addressed to "the one god," and other tablets in which the manifold deities of the popular faith are made but the different names and titles of Anu. This monotheism must be carefully distinguished from the hienotheism of some of the hymns, in which the
author seems to ascribe to the deity he is addressing attributes which, according to our ideas, would exclude the existence of any other god, but which he ascribes the next moment, in the same uncompromising way, to a wholly different divinity. The monotheistic school appears to have died out during the epoch of the Cassite dynasty.
The state religion, once elaborated, underwent no material change. The places of the gods, indeed, were moved from time to time, as one city or another rose to pre-eminence ; Assur, the local deity of the old capital
Assur, being set at the head of the divine hierarchy in Assyria, and Merodach usurping the place of the older Bel or Mul-ge in the Babylon of Nebuchadrezzar. But the main outlines of the system remained
unaltered. While the Accadian substructure, with its spirits and its
exorcisms, faded more and more out of view, especially in Assyria,

while the religion of the Assyrian monarchs can be with difficulty
distinguished from that of their Phoenician kindred, —the creed that was based upon it lasted to the end. A time came, however, when the popular theology entered into the schools of philosophy. The gods were resolved into elements and
abstractions, and it was taught that they and the universe alike had originated, out of a chaos of waters. This system of cosmogony has been embodied in the poem of the Creation in seven days, which bears such a remarkable likeness to the first chapter of Genesis, but does not
seem to be older than the age of Assur-bani-pal. The system of the poem agrees with the statements of Damascius {De Prim. Princip. 125,
p. 384, ed. Kopp), who tells us that Apas6n or Ap'su, " the deep," and Mummu Tiamtu (Moyrais ^ Tavthe), " the chaos of the sea," were the
original principles out of which all things have been begotten. Of them were born Lakhvu and Lakhva (Dakhos and Dakhe) ; of them again Kisar and Sar (Kissare and Assoros), the lower and upper firmaments, who originated the three supreme gods, Anu, Ehim or Bel,

and Hea, the latter being the father of Bel-Merodach, the Demiurge. This theory of emanations was the source of later Gnostic speculation, while the philosophic explanation of the universe it embodied made
its way into Ionia, and there started Greek speculative philosophy.
Thales and his doctrines drew their ultimate inspiration from Babylonia. An earlier cosmogonic system is found in an Accadian legend of the Creation preserved in the library of Cuthah. According to this the present Koa-fios or regulated universe was preceded by an anarchical
chaos, in which Nature had made its first essays in creating. Composite creatures had been formed out of the earth and the deep, like those engraved on the gems and cylinders, or painted, according to Berosos, on the walls of the temple of BeL There were men with the bodies
of birds or the tails of fish, and human beings with birds' faces. The philosophy of Anaximander, which has been termed an anticipation of
Darwinism, may be traced to this cosmological theory. The after-life expected by the Babylonian was as dreary as that expected by the Greek. Hades was beneath the earth, a place of darkness and gloom, from which none might return, where the spirits
of the dead flitted like bats, with dust alone for their food. Here the shadowy phantoms of the heroes of old time sate crowned, each on his
throne (comp. Is. xiv. 9), and in the midst rose the fortress-palace of Nin-'sur or Allat, the goddess of death. Hades was guarded by seven
gates and seven warders, who stripped the spirit that entered of all he
possessed ; and in early days, when the geographical knowledge of the Accadians was limited, its entrance was believed to be in the marshes beyond the mouth of the Euphrates. But even within the abode of Nin-'sur the waters of life bubbled up at the foot of the golden throne
of the spirits of earth, and whosoever could drink of them might return to the upper world. A happier lot was reserved for a few.
Xisuthros and his wife were translated for their piety to the blissful
fields beyond Datilla, the river of death ; the spirit of Hea-bani, the friend of Gisdhubar, summoned by the prayers of his friends, rose like a cloud of dust out of the ground and ascended to heaven, where gods and heroes lie on couches feasting and drinking limpid water ; while an Assyrian court-poet prays that his lord may hereafter have " ever
lasting " life in the land of the silver sky, where the gods revel and know no ilL
But the fear of the evils that the demons were perpetually devising against him while alive must have made the life of the Babylonian



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 393
filmost intolerable. Every day and almost every hour had its religious ceremony, the neglect or mal performance of which brought down upon him some misfortune. Banished from the state religion, magic became a science. An elaborate system of augury was gradually formed, and omens were drawn from every event that could possibly happen. The power once exercised by the sorcerer-priest was now
transferred to the necromancer and witch, —who, by the way, was
supposed to fly through the air on a wooden stick, —with the difference that the power of the latter was believed to be exercised only for evil. The exorcisms which had in early days formed a prayer-book now formed a distinct branch of literature, and survived long after the fall of the Babylonian monarchy. The bronze bowls found by Sir A, H. Layard, as well as the part played by charms and demons in the Talmud, show how strongly the belief in magic had seized not only upon the native mind, but on that of the Jews also who had settled in the country. Through the Jews and various Gnostic systems of
early Christianity, aided in part by the superstitions of imperial Rome, the belief found its way into the mediaeval Church, and the features of the mediaeval devil may be traced in an Assyrian bas-relief, which
represents the dragon of Chaos, with claws, tail, horns, and wings, pursued by the Sun -god Merodach. Even the phylacteries of the Jews go back to the same origin. Accadian magic ordered the sorcerer to bind the charm, twice knotted with seven knots, round the
limbs of the sick man ; and this, with the further application of holy water, or the binding of a sentence from " a good book " about the
suff"erer's head, would infallibly produce a cure. Babylonian mythology is a more pleasing subject than the magic which made the " Chaldeans " famous in later days. The myths of Accad were rich and manifold, and necessarily gained much by the Semitic conquest. Reference has already been made to some of them, and there are many that reappear under more or less changed forms in Jewish and Greek literature. We have learned at last how great was the debt owed by Greek mythology to the poets of ancient Babylonia, whose legends found their way to the west through the mouths of Phoenicians and Hittites. Addnis and Aphrodite are the Tammuz and Istar of Accadian story ; and the death of Adfinis, and the descent of the goddess into Hades to search for him, formed the subject of Accadian poems before the Greek perhaps had yet reached his future home. The theft of Prometheus has its analogue in the
story of the god Zu, " the divine storm-bird," who stole the lightning

of Bel, the tablet wherein destiny is written, and was punished for his
crime by the father of the gods. Gisdhuba'r, originally the old
Accadian Fire-god, and then a solar hero, is the prototype of Herakles. Hea-bani, the confidant and adviser of Gisdhubar, is the Kentaur Kheiron, for Kheiron was the son of Kronos, and Kronos is identified by Ber6so8 with Hea, the ** creator " of Hea-bani. The lion slain by the Chaldean hero is the lion of Nemea ; the winged bull made by Anu to revenge the slight suffered by Istar is the bull of Krete ; the
tyrant Khumbaba, slain by Gisdhubar in *' the land of the pine-trees,
the seat of the gods, the sanctuary of the spirits," is the tyrant Geryon ; ^ the gems borne by the trees of the forest beyond " the gateway of the sun " are the apples of the Hesperides ; and the deadly sickness of Gisdhubar himself is but the fever caused by the poisoned
tunic of Nessos. Even the encircling ocean, with its gates, where the women Sabitu and Siduri keep eternal watch, is the Okeanos of Homeric legend. Naturally the impress made by Babylonian mythology upon the western Semites was deeper than that which it made upon the Greeks. An echo of the war waged between Merodach and the powers of chaos and darkness, headed by the dragon of the sea, the seven-headed " serpent of night," still survives in the Apocalypse.
The sacred tree, with its guardian cherubs, as well as the flaming
sword of the lightning, with its fifty points and seven heads, recall
biblical analogies ; and the legend of the plague-demon Lubara brings to our remembrance the vision of David when the angel of pestilence hovered over Jerusalem.
Art, Literature, and Science. —The art of Assyria was the copy and
offspring of that of Babylonia. At the same time the copy was a free
one, and in many points differed very materially from its model. The
difference was caused in part by the want of stone in Babylonia and its abundance in Assyria. In Babylonia brick had to take the place
of stone ; stone, in fact, was costly, and used only for such objects as
seals and signets, for boundary - marks and royal statues. It is a
curious illustration of the servile dependence of Assyria upon
Babylonia in artistic matters, that up to the last brick was largely
used there in the construction of the royal palaces, in spite of its rapid decay and the ease with which stone might have been pro
cured. Slabs of alabaster were nevertheless employed to line the walls, and where, therefore, the Babylonians were forced to have
* Khumbaba appears as Kombabos in Lucian, De Dea Syria, 19-26.



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 398
r(>course to painting, the Assyrians made a liberal use of sculpture
in relief.
The existing remains of Babylonian and Assyrian architecture are further distinguished by the religious character of the one and the
secular character of the other. The attention which was primarily devoted to the construction of temples in Babylonia was devoted to the construction of palaces in Assyria. The temple in Assyria was a mere appendage of the palace, whereas in the sister kingdom, while the only palaces of which we know are those of the dynasty of Nebuchad
rezzar, the site of every great city is marked by the ruins of its
temples. Hence the general style of architecture was different, the temple, with its huge masses of brickwork, rising stage upon stage, each brilliantly painted and surmounted by a chamber which was at once a shrine and an observatory, while the palace was built upon a heap of rubble, with open courts and imposing entrances, but never more than two or three stories high.
Columnar architecture had its natural home upon the banks of the Euphrates. Wood and brick had to take the place of stone, and naturally suggested the employment of the column, which soon became a mere ornament and developed into a great variety of forms. Coloured half-columns were used in the temple of Lig-Bagas at Erech for decorative purposes long ages before they were employed in the same way by Sargon at Khorsabad, and it is to Babylonia and Assyria rather than to Egypt that we must trace the Doric and Ionic pillars of Greece. But the chasteness of Greek taste preserved it from the many fantastic forms into which the column branched out in Baby
lonia and Assyria, where we find it resting with a circular base on
the backs of lions, dogs, and winged bulls. While the column thus became an ornament rather than a support, the buttresses against which the early Chaldean temples rested never
lost their original character. Like the walls, they were covered with
plaster and painted with bright colours or overlaid with plates of shining metal. Enamelled bricks, which were first painted, then
glazed, and finally baked in the fire, were often used for the purpose ; sometimes, as at Warka, we see cones of various colours and embedded
in plaster taking their place. The rain was carried off by elaborately
constructed drains, some of which afford us the earliest examples of
the arch, and which occasionally consisted of leaden pipes.
In Assyria sculpture was used in the stead of painting, although the
bas-reliefs were judiciously picked out with red, blue, black, and white



396 APPENDIX II.
colours, none of which, however, were of the same brilliancy as the
colours used in Babylonia. This use of colour to heighten the effect of
sculpture, which we find also in Egypt, was adopted by the Greeks, who probably derived it, with so many other elements of art, from the
cultured populations of the Euphrates valley. Assyrian sculpture in relief may be said to have passed through three phases of develop
ment The first phase, best represented by the reign of Assur-natsir
pal, is characterised by a simplicity and vigour which shows itself
especially in the drawing of animal forms. Nothing, for instance, can be bolder and more life-like than a scene in which the monarch is depicted hunting lions ; but the freshness and freedom of the work are marred by an almost total want of perspective, an absence of delicacy
in the execution, and a servile minuteness in reproducing the outlines. No attempt is made to fill in the background. The second phase lasts from the beginning of the Second Empire to the reign of Esarhaddon, and was doubtless influenced by the delicate work in bronze and ivory executed by the Phoenician settlers in Nineveh. The care formerly expended on the chief figures is now extended to the background, which is finished with a pre-Raffaelite minuteness that reminds us of elaborate embroidery. What has been lost in vigour is gained
in richness, though the realism of the work is too obtrusive to allow it
to be examined with microscopic eyes. The reign of Assur-bani-pal marks the third and best phase of Assyrian art in relief. Drawing
has much improved, and the sculptures furnish several instances of
successful foreshortening. The exactitude with which animal and
vegetable forms are represented is relieved by a general softness of
tone, while the overcrowding of the previous period is avoided by a recur
rence fco the earlier mode of leaving the background bare, or else by in
troducing merely the outlines of a landscape. Nevertheless, the art shows symptoms of the same effeminacy and decay that strike us also
in the choice of subjects. Scenes are taken for the first time from the
harem ; and in contrast with tlie lion-hunts of a former age in the
open field, Assur-bani-pal is made to enjoy the pleasures of a royal
battue, where tame lions are let out of their cages and whipped into
activity.
Admirable as the Assjrrian artists were when they sculptured in
relief, they failed altogether as soon as they came to the round. Here the artists of Babylonia much surpassed them. In Babylonia stone
was too precious to be used for other than decorative or legal purposes,
and the largest stones procurable were blocks of black basalt or diorite,



r BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 397
which could be carved into statues but not cut up into slabs. Statuary
of a certain kind, therefore, flourished there from the earliest epoch.
But it was always heavy, the figures being represented in a sitting
])osture, though much skill was shown in the delineation of the face.
On the other hand, the carved gems are often very good, a spirit of humour and light-heartedness appearing in them which we look for
in vain in Assyria. Gem-cutting, in fact, originated in Babylonia, and thence spread through the western world. Though frequently rude, the
very earliest intaglios are invariably clear and vigorous. Emery must have been used in their manufacture, and the work is sometimes extremely fine. The Accadians were also skilled in terra-cotta and bronze work.
The terra-cotta and bronze images of King Gudea are quite astonishing
when we consider their antiquity. Spirited bas-reliefs in terra-cotta have been found at Senkereh, and many of the vases made by the Accadian potters display great beauty of form, and must plainly have been modelled on the wheel, though the majority are handmade and rude. Assyrian pottery is also very good, but the native work in bronze is poor. The bronze gates of Balaw4t, for example, where the bas-reliefs have all been hammered out from behind and then chiselled, belong to the infancy of art, though the forms are bold and vigorous. The engraved bronze bowls and similar objects found at Nineveh were the work of Phoenicians. Babylonia was celebrated from the first for the manufacture of textile fabrics, and the oldest gems furnish us with specimens of richly embroidered dresses. Goldsmiths' work, too, had already attained a high perfection in the Accadian period. At a later epoch the Assyrians equally excelled in metallurgy, and their bronze casts, as
distinguished from hammer-work in relief, are of a high order of merit Their gold earrings and bracelets are admirable both in design and in workmanship, and so well were they acquainted with the art of inlaying one metal with another that our modem artists have been content to learn from them the method of covering iron with bronze. Their chairs and other articles of household furniture are equally worthy of imitation. Besides porcelain, they were acquainted with glass, though transparent glass does not seem to have come into use before the age of Sargon. Coloured glass was known at a much earlier date.
But the Assyrians had none of that love of brilliant colours which
characterised their neighbours in the south. Though the introduction
of vegetable forms into their bas-reliefs shows that tlieir art was less



398 APPENDIX II.
intensely human than that of the Greeks, they were never led to cultivate the gardens for which Babylon was renowned. It was
Babylonia, again, and not AssjTia, that was famous for the manufacture of dyed and variegated stuffs. Iron was little used in the Accadian period, and we may infer from the ideographs which represent it that the only iron known was meteoric. On the other hand, besides stone implements, bronze and copper weapons and tools were largely in use, and bronze bowls are found in nearly all the early tombs, fashioned sometimes with considerable skill. With the Semitic period the employment of iron becomes more common. Of Babylonian and Assyrian music little is known beyond the fact
that there were diflferent instruments for producing it. Accad was the China of Western Asia. Almost everyone could read and write. Clay was plentiful, and the writing-paper of the Accadians was mostly of clay. The characters were impressed with a
metal stylus upon clay tablets (the laterculce codiles of Pliny), which
were then baked in the sun, or (in Assyria) in a kiln. Papyrus,
however, was also extensively used, though it has all now perished.
Indeed papyrus, or some similar vegetable substance, preceded clay as
a writing-material, the primitive hieroglyphics out of which the cuneiform characters arose having been painted on it by the Accadians
before they left their original home in Elam. The hieroglyphics were
arranged in vertical columns like the Chinese. After their settlement
in the alluvial plain of Babylonia, and their adoption of clay as
a writing-material, the Accadians altered the arrangement of their
characters, the vertical lines becoming horizontal oaes, and running
from left to right. By this process the old hieroglyphics were laid
upon their sides. At the same time the forms of the hieroglyphics themselves underwent a change. It was difficult to make curved lines upon the clay, while the impress of the stylus assumed a wedge-like
shape. The primitive pictures thus became cuneiform or wedge-shaf>ed characters, which had already come to be employed phonetically as
well as ideographically. When the Semites borrowed them, a great extension was given to the phonetic element, the sounds which expressed words in Accadian becoming mere phonetic values in the Semitic syllabary. Hence the same character can denote more than one syllabic sound, and at the same time can be used ideographically.
Long before the Semitic period, or even before the earliest period of which we have contemporaneous record, the Accadian characters



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 399
liad all been classified and arranged. Compound characters were naturally called by the names of those out of which they were composed, though the proof of this has sometimes been obliterated
even in the archaic forms of the characters found on the bricks of
Lig-Bagas. After the Semitic conquest no pains were spared to facilitate a knowledge of the Accadian literature and the characters in which it
was written. Like the syllabary, the literature of the Semitic Babylonians and Assyrians was mostly of Accadian origin, and it was consequently necessary for them to be acquainted with the language in which it was embodied. Syllabaries, grammars, vocabularies, and reading-books were accordingly drawn up in Accadian and
Semitic, and the old Accadian texts were accompanied by interlinear translations, sometimes arranged in a parallel column. When Accadian became extinct, about the seventeenth century RC, the translations alone of many of the old texts were preserved ; it was only where the original text was important, as in legal documents or
in the sacred hymns—the very language of which was held to be
inspired—that it continued to be copied. In the time of Assur-bani
pal an attempt was made by the litterati to revive the old language, and it became fashionable to write compositions in Accadian, many of which, however, resembled the " dog-Latin " of our own day. A knowledge of the old mode of writing continued down to the Christian era, the latest document so written being, as has been already men
tioned, a conti;^ct-tablet, dated in the reign of the Parthian king Pakoros, the contemporary of Domitian.
From the earliest period the literature of Chaldea was stored in
public libraries. According to Berosos, Pantibibla, or "book-town," was one of the antediluvian cities of Babylonia, and Xisuthros had
buried his books at Sippara — perhaps in reference to the Semitic
sepher, " book "—before the Flood. Every great city had at least one library, and the office of librarian was considered honourable enough to be held by the brother of the king. The most famous of the Babylonian libraries were those of Erech, Lar'sa, and Ur, and (after the Semitic conquest) of Agadd The older library of Babylon perished for the most part when the town was destroyed by Sennacherib. Scribes were kept busily employed in copying and
re-editing old texts, and more rarely in preparing new ones. The
copies were made with scrupulous care, and an illegible character or word was denoted by the statement that there was a " lacuna," or a



400 APPENDIX II.
"recent lacuna," while attention was drawn to the breakage of a tablet. When an Assyrian scribe Was in doubt as to the meaning
of a character in his Babylonian copy, he either reproduced it or gave it two or more possible equivalents in the Assyrian syllabary. The libraries established by the Assyrian kings at Assur, Calah, and Nineveh, were formed in imitation of those of Babylonia. Like the Babylonian libraries, also, they were thrown open to the public, though it is extremely doubtful whether the reading public was
80 large in Assyria as in the sister kingdom. At any rate, their
contents were derived almost entirely from Babylonia. The tablets or books were all numbered and arranged in order, and the table of the chapters in the great astronomical work compiled for Sargon's
library at Agad6 (B.C. 2000) enjoins the student to hand to the librarian in writing the number of the book or chapter he wishes to
procure.
The literature contained in these libraries comprised every branch
of learning known at the time. Historical and mythological docu
ments ; religious compositions ; legal, geographical, astronomical, and
astrological treatises; magical formulae and omen tablets; poems,
fables, and proverbs ; grammatical and lexical disquisitions ; lists of
stones and trees, of birds and beasts, of tribute and eponyms ; copies
of treaties, of commercial transactions, of correspondence, of petitions to the king, of royal proclamations, and of despatches from generals
in the field, — all were represented. The mythological and religious
literature was particularly extensive and interesting. Along with the
latter must be classed certain penitential hymns, which may favourably compare with the Hebrew psalms. Thus in one of them we read
:
"O my God, my transgression is great, my sins are many ... I lay on the ground, and none seized me by the hand ; I wept, and my palms none took. I cried aloud ; there was none that would hear me. I am in darkness and trouble ; I lifted not myself up. To my God
my distress I referred, my prayer I addressed." The omen-tablets chiefly belong to a work in 137 books, compiled for Sargon of Agadd. Among the fables may be mentioned a dialogue between the ox and the horse, and another between the eagle and the sun ; while we may reckon with the proverbs not only the riddle which the wise man pro
pounded to the gods, and to which the answer is plainly the air, but
also the songs with which the Accadian ^ox-drivers beguiled their labours in the field. Two of these are worth quoting : " An heifer am I ; to the cow thou art yoked ; the plough's handle is strong ; lift it up, lift



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 401
it up ! " " The knees are marching, the feet are not resting ; with no wealth of thine own, grain thou begettest for me." Folklore was more poorly represented than mythology, though some specimens of it have been preserved. It was the great epics and mythological poems, however, which naturally occupied the chief place in each library. A fragmentary catalogue of them has come down to us along with the reputed authors of these standard works. Thus the Epic of Gisdhubar
was ascribed to a certain Sin-liki-unnini ; the legend of Etana to Nis
Sin ; the story of the fox to Kak-Merodach, the son of Eri-Turnunna. Some of their titles are quoted in Accadian, and their composition
referred to Accadian poets ; others belong to the Semitic period. Among the latter is the Epic of Gisdhubar in its present form, which
is based upon an astronomical principle, the subject-matter of each of its twelve books corresponding with the name of a Zodiacal sign. The
lion is slain, for instance, under the Zodiacal Leo, the sign of Virgo answers to the wooing of the hero by Istar, and the sign of Aquarius
to the episode of the Deluge. This is rather violently introduced into
the eleventh book, and, like the rest of the epic, is pieced together out
of older poems, fragments of some of which we possess in the original
Accadian text. Perhaps the most beautiful of these early legends is
that which describes the descent of Istar into Hades in search of her
husband, the Sun-god Tammuz, slain by the boar's tusk of winter. The legend curiously survives in a moral form in the Talmud, where Istar has been changed into the demon of lust. Science was cliiefly represented by astronomy, which had its first home among the Accadians. But it soon connected itself with the pseudo-science of astrology, the false assumption having been made that whatever event had been observed to follow a particular celestial phenomenon would recur if the phenomenon happened again. Observa
tories were established in all the chief towns, and astronomers-royal
were appointed, who had to send fortnightly reports to the king. At an early date the stars were numbered and named ; the Zodiacal signs had been mapped out while the vernal equinox still fell in Taurus
;
and eclipses of the sun and moon had been found to recur after a
certain fixed time, and were consequently calculated and looked for.
The equator was divided into degrees, sixty being the unit, as in other departments of mathematics. A table of lunar longitudes belongs to the Accadian period, and fragments of a planisphere, which marks the
appearance of the sky at the vernal equinox, are now in the British Museum. The year was reckoned to consist of twelve lunar months 2D



402 APPENDIX II.
of thirty days each, intercalary months being counted in by the priests when necessary. In Accadian times the commencement of the year was determined by the position of the star Capella (a Aurigse),
called Dilgan, " the messenger of light," in relation to the new moon at
the vernal equinox. The night was originally divided into three watches, but this was afterwards superseded by the more accurate
division of the day into twelve casbu, or " double hours," corresponding
to the divisions of the equator, each casbu of two hours being further
subdivided into sixty minutes, and these again into sixty seconds.
Time was measured, at all events at a later epoch, by means of the clepsydra, and the gnomon or dial was a Babylonian invention. So also was the week of seven days, which was closely connected with the
early astronomical studies of the Accadians, the days of the week
being dedicated to the moon, sun, and five planets. The 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st, and 28th days of the lunar month were kept like the Jewish Sabbath, and were actually so named in Assyriaa They were termed dies nefasti in Accadian, rendered "days of completion (of labour) " in Assyrian ; the Assyrian Sahattu or " Sabbath " itself being further defined as meaning " completion of work " and " a day of rest
for the soul." On these days it was forbidden, at all events in the
Accadian period, to cook food, to change one's dress or wear white
robes, to offer sacrifice, to ride in a chariot, to legislate, to perform
military service, or even to use medicine. The month was further
divided into two halves of fifteen days each, these being again sub
divided into three periods of five days. The standard work on astronomy and astrology was that in seventy-two books, compiled for the library of Sargon at Agad^, and
entitled the Observations of Bel. It was subsequently translated into
Greek by Ber6sos. The table of contents shows that it treated of
various matters, —eclipses, comets, the pole-star, the phases of Venus
and Mars, the conjunction of the sun and moon, the changes of the weather, and the like. After each observation comes the event which was believed to have happened in connection with it, and the number of observations shows for how long a period they must have been accumulating before the second millennium B.c. We can in fact trace the beginnings of Babylonian astronomy back to an age when the Accadians were still shepherds and herdsmen among the mountains of Elam ; it was above Elam that the zenith was fixed, and the heaven
was regarded as a great pasture land, the ecliptic being " the bull of
light" or "the furrow of the sky," and the stars "the heavenly flock,"



r BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 403
whose shepherd was Arcturus (a Bootis). It may be added that
ITammuz represented Orion.
The attention given to astronomy presupposes a considerable advance in mathematics. This in fact was the case. The system of cyphers was a comparatively easy one to handle, and was simplified
by the habit of understanding the multiple 60 in expressing high
numbers, —IV,, for instance, denoting 4 x 60 = 240. Sixty was also the unexpressed denominator of a fraction, 1| being represented by
I.XL., i.e. If^. A tablet from the library of Lar'sa gives a table of
squares and cubes correctly calculated from 1 to 60, and a series of
geometrical figures used for augural purposes implies the existence of
a Babylonian Euclid. Even the plan of an estate outside the gate of Zamama at Babylon, in the time of Nebuchadrezzar, has been discovered which shows no mean knowledge of surveying. Some acquaintance with mechanics is evidenced by the use of the lever and pulley; and the discovery of a crystal lens on the site of Nineveh
suggests that some of the microscopic characters on the tablets were
inscribed with artificial aid, as well as the possibility of a rude kind of telescope having been employed for astronomical observations. At
all events, one astronomical record states that " Venus rises, and in its orbit duly grows in size." Mr. Kassam has discovered on the site of Babylon remains of the hydraulic machinery used for watering the Hanging Gardens of Nebuchadrezzar. The ideas of that primitive epoch, when as yet astronomy in its simplest form wae unknown, survived in the popular mythology. The " mountain of the world," or Rowandiz, the Accadian Olympos, was believed to be the pivot on which the heaven rested, covering the earth like a huge extinguisher. The world was bound to it by a
rope, like that with which the sea was churned in Hindu legend, or the golden cord of Homer, wherewith Zeus proposed to suspend the nether earth after binding the cord about Olympos (//. viiL 19-26)
Eclipses were caused by the war of the seven evil spirits or stormdemons against the moon, and a long poem tells how Samas and Istar fled to the upper heaven of Anu when the war began, and how Merodach had finally to come to the rescue of the troubled moon.
Language, Law, Trade, and Agriculture.—As already stated, the
original languages of Accad and Sumer were agglutinative, the cases of
the noun being indicated by postpositions, and were related to the dialects spoken in Elam (Susian, Cassite, and Amardian). The
Semitic language known as Assyrian consisted of the two dialects,



404 APPENDIX U.
Babylonian and Assyrian, the first being distinguished by a preference
for softer sounds and a longer retention of the mimniation. It was
closely allied to Hebrew and Phoenician, more distantly to Arabic, and more distantly still to Aramaic, while it had many points of
resemblance to Ethiopic. The archaic and finished character of its
grammar, and the fulness of its vocabulary, make it the Sanskrit of the
Semitic tongues. The literary dialect underwent little change during
the 1500 years that we can trace its career, the result being that it
came to differ very considerably from the language of everyday life spoken at Nineveh or Babylon in later times. Aramaic became the lingua franca of trade and diplomacy after the overthrow of Tyre and Sidon under the Second Assyrian Empire, and in course of time gradually superseded the older language of the country. In Baby
lonia, however, this did not happen until after the Persian conquest. Law was highly developed in Chaldea from an early period, and a large number of the precedents of an Assyrian judge, like the titles on which he had to decide, went back to the Accadian epocL An Accadian code of laws shows us that the mother occupied the same prominent place in the community as among other " Turanian
"
peoples. A married woman was permitted to hold property ; at the
same time the husband might repudiate his wife after paying a fine, but the wife who repudiated her husband was punished by drowning.
The master who ill-treated or killed his slave was fined, and the slave was allowed to purchase his freedom. Property was carefully pro
tected ; the maximum rate of interest was fixed ; and houses, land, or slaves could be taken as security for debt. Judges were appointed throughout the kingdom, and forbidden to accept bribes, while prisons were established in every town. The most ancient written code was ascribed to the god Hea or Oannes. As in Attika, the boundaries of property were marked by stelce, one of which informs us that the ground mentioned on it was bestowed by the king on a poet-laureate in return for some complimentary verses ; and deeds were drawn up on tablets, often enclosed in an outer coating of clay, and connected by a string with a papyrus docket. These deeds were duly witnessed and sealed. Sennacherib has left behind a sort of will, in which he leaves certain property to his favourite son, Esar-haddon. The taxpayers were divided into burghers and aliens, some of the taxes being paid
for the use of the public brickyards and roads. In the time of the Second Assyrian Empire municipal taxes and the tribute of subject states formed an important part of the imperial revenue. Nineveh,



BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA. 405
for instance, paid every year 30 talents, 20 of which went to the maintenance of the fleet, Assyria as a whole being assessed at 274 talents; Carchemish paid 100 talents, Arpad 30, and Megiddo 15. B| Trade and commerce were the creation of the Semites, and were
^^ particularly active in the later days of the Assyrian monarchy. The
trade of Assyria was mainly overland —that of Babylonia maritime. The teak found at Mugheir proves that it extended as far as India
;
on the other side wares came from the coasts and islands of Asia Minor, from Egypt, and from Southern Arabia. Coined money, however, was as yet unknown, and the maneh of Carchemish, after the capture of that city, was made the standard of weight. Interest was
usually at four per cent ; but sometimes, more especially when objects
like iron were borrowed, at three per cent. Houses were let on lease, and the deeds which conveyed them gave a careful inventory of their contents. A house sold at Nineveh on the 16th of Sivan, or May, B.C. 692, fetched one maneh of silver, or £9, the average price of a slave. The records of the Egibi banking firm recently discovered in Babylonia extend from the reign of Nebuchadrezzar to that of Darius Hystaspis ; the deeds were kept in large jars, and like the Rothschilds
of modern days, the firm increased its wealth by lending money to kings. The father generally took his sons into partnership during his
lifetime.
While the Semite devoted himself to trade, the Accadian was an
agriculturist, and up to the last agriculture occupied a more prominent
place in Babylonia than it ever did in Assyria. The canals were a matter of special importance, and their management was superintended by the state. Market-gardeners might lease the ground of richer proprietors, and the tenant had to give one-third of the produce to the owner. The country was covered with gardens ; Merodach-baladan has left us a list of no less than seventy-three belonging to himself.
At an earlier date, Tiglath-Pileser I., in imitation of the Babylonian
princes, tried to acclimatise in royal botanical gardens some of the trees he had met with in his campaigns ; but his example does not seem to have been followed, and agriculture of all kinds was never popular
in Assyria, where it was relegated to the slaves. Our knowledge of Assyro-Babylonian administration is too slight to allow us to say more of it than that the government was an absolute
monarchy, the court consisting of a large number of officials who owed their rank to the king. After the time of Tiglath-Pileser I., the
subject provinces were placed under satraps, the cities of the empire



406 APPENDIX III.
being governed by prefects. Besides the turtannu (tartan), or
commander-in-chief, who stood on the king's right, there were other military oflBcers, such as the "sultan," the colonel ("man of three
troops "), " the captain of fifty," and " the captain of ten," wlio might
assume the command in his absence. Among the chief officials of
state may be mentioned the Eab-saki (Rab-shakeh), or Vizier, the Rab
saris or Chamberlain, the Music-director, and the Astronomer-Royal.
III.
THE PHCENICIANS.
While the struggle for supremacy between Accadian and Semite was going on in the east, another branch of the Semitic race was establish
ing itself on the western coast of Asia. A narrow but fertile strip of
land, from 10 to 15 miles in breadth and 150 in length, shut in between the snow-clad peaks of Lebanon and the sea, and stretching from the Bay of Antioch to the promontory of Carmel, was the home of the Phoenicians. They called it Canaan, " the lowlands," a name which was afterwards extended to denote the whole district of Palestine inhabited by kindred tribes. The Egyptians named it the land of Keft, or the " palm," of which the Greek Phcenik^ is but a
translation. The early date at which it was occupied is shown by the emigrations from it to the Delta in the time of the Middle Egyptian Empire ; by the time the Hyksos were ruling at Memphis the mouths of the Nile had become so thickly populated by Phoenicians as to
cause the whole coastland to be termed Keft-ur (Caphtor), or " Greater
Phoenicia."
According to Grenesis, Sidon, " the fishing city," was the firstborn of Canaan. Native legends, however, claimed an older foundation for
the sacred city of Gebal or Byblos, northward of Beyrftt. Beyrtit itself, the Berytos of classical writers, was dependent on Gebal, and
along with it formed d. distinct territory in the midst of the Phoenician
states. These consisted of nine chief cities, Akko (now Acre), Achzib or Ekdippa (now Zib), Tyre (now Sflr), Sidon (now Saida), Botrys (now Batrun), Tripolis (now TarAbolus), Marathus (now Amrit), Arvad or Aradus and Antaradus (now RuM and Tartfls), and Ramantha or Laodikeia (now Ladakiyeh). With these may be counted Zemar or
Simyra (now Sumra), to the north of Tripolis, inhabited by an



THE PHGENICIANS. 407
independent tribe, like Arka (now Tel *Arka). The country was watered by rivers, six of which were invested with divine attributes like the mountains from which they flowed. The Eleutheros (Nahr el-Kebir) in the north is followed by the Ad6nis (Nahr el-Ibrahim), by whose banks the women of Byblos lamented the dead Sun-god Tammuz ; the Lykos (Nahr el-Kelb), where Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian conquerors have erected their memorials ; the Tamyras (Nahr Damftr) ; the Bostrenos (Nahr el-'AwS,ly) ; and the Belos (Nahr Na'm^n). With the mountains in their rear the inhabitants of the Phoenician
cities were driven to the sea. They became fishermen, traders, and colonists. First Kypros, called Kittim from the town of Kition, was colonised; then Rhodes, Th^ra, Melos, and other islands of the -^gean;
then came the settlements on the coasts of Greece itself, in Sicily
and Sardinia, and on the northern shores of Africa; and finally the
colonies of Karteia, near Gibraltar, and Gades or Cadiz, which led the adventurous emigrants into the waters of the unknown Atlantic.
Karteia lay in the district of Tarshish or Tartessos, long the extreme western boundary both of Phoenician voyages and of the known world. But before the sixth century B.C., the Phoenicians had not only penetrated to the north-western coast of India, but probably to the
island of Britain as well.
Tradition brought them* originally from the Persian Gulf, and the
similarity of name caused the island of Tylos or Tyros, now Bahrein,
to be named as the'Teountry from which the forefathers of the Tyrians had come. The tradition pointed to a fact. The close resemblance between the Phoeniko-Hebrew and Assyro-Babylonian languages proves that the speakers of them must have lived together for some time after
their separation from the rest of their Semitic kindred, as does also the
common possession of such deities as Malik or Moloch, Baal or Bel, perhaps also Dakan and Dagon, which were not of Accadian origin. Most of the tribes comprehended under the title of Canaanites in the Old Testament were really Phoenician, though the Egyptian monuments show that the Amorites were of Arab descent, while the Hittites belonged to a different stock from the Semites The Hebrews themselves, if we may trust the evidence of language, physiognomy, and
character, had the same ancestors as the Phoenicians, and at the time of the conquest of Canaan only differed from the people they expelled in
being rude nomads instead of cultivated citizens. It is nevertheless
possible that intermarriage with the aborigines of the country—a race



408 APPENDIX III.
of whom we know but little—had produced a modification of type and character among the natives of Phoenicia ; but if so, the modification was not great Towards the north the Phoenicians were affected by
contact with their cousins, the Arameans or Syrians, who occupied Damascus and the southern coast of the Orontes, and under the name
of the Rutennu appear in the Egyptian inscriptions as extending southward of the Hittites as far as the banks of the Euphrates. Sidon and Tyre alike consisted of two towns. Those of Sidon were both on the mainland, and were known as the Less and the Greater
;
those of Tyre were distinguished as insular Tyre and Palaetyros.
Palsetyros stood on the coast, and, if we may trust its name, was older
than the city which occupied a double island at a little distance from the shore, and eventually claimed supremacy over it But insular
Tyre was of itself of early foundation, since the great temple of Baal
Melkarth, the Phoenician H^rakles, which rose on the eastern side of
the smaller island, was built, as the priests told Herodotos, 2300 years
before his time, or about 2750 B.C.; and the name Tyre itself—Tsor
in Phoenician—denoted the " rock " on which the insular city stood. When it was visited by the Egyptian Mohar in the time of Kamses II., the water drunk by its inhabitants had all to be conveyed from the
mainland in boats. Tsarau or Palsetyros, we learn, had been recently burnt Arvad or Arados was similarly on an island, and held rule over the two cities of the neighbouring .coast, Marathos and Kame. Gebal had originally been built inland, on the northern bank of the
Nahr el-Kelb, before its inhabitants migrated to the shore. Phoenicia was known to the Accadians under the names of Titnum
and Martu, the latter of which signified " the path of the setting sun," and was rendered into Semitic by Akharru, " the back " or ** western " land. An old geographical tablet makes Khikhi and Lakhi the two divisions of Phoenicia, a word which has been compared with the Fenekh of the Egyjjtian inscriptions. Cudur-Malug, the Elamite, had sprung from the cities of Martu, though this may mean the West generally and not Phoenicia in particular; and Chedor-laomer had held
Palestine under his sway for thirteen years in the age of Abraham. Sargon of Agad6 not only set up his image on the shores of the Mediterranean, but even penetrated as far as Kypros, bringing with him the elements of that Babylonian civilisation which spread from Kypros
into Asia Minor. Phoenicia itself was equally affected by Chaldean
culture, which long dominated over the art of the eastern basin of the Mediterranean.



THE PH(ENICIANS. 409
The Phcenicians, indeed, were an eminently receptive people. Like
the rest of their Semitic brethren, they lacked originality, but they were gifted beyond most other races with the power of assimilating and combining, of adapting and improving on their models. Phoenician
art derives its origin from Babylonia, from Egypt, and in later times from Assyria ; but it knew how to combine together the elements it had received, and to return them, modified and improved, to the countries from which they had been borrowed. The Phoenicians were the most skilful workmen of the ancient world, and the empire of the Euphrates, which had first taught them the art of gem-cutting, of pottery-making, and of dyeing embroidery, was glad to learn in turn from its pupils. Already, in the age of Thothmes III., we see the Phoe
nicians on the walls of Rekhmara's tomb at Thebes bringing as tribute vases with animals' heads, similar to those found at Rhodes and Hissar
lik, and clad in richly-embroidered kilts. But the most precious acquisition of the Phoenicians was the alphabet This was borrowed by the settlers in Caphtor or the Delta from their Egyptian neighbours in the time of the Middle Empire or the early days of Hyksos dominion,

all the other incumbrances of the Egyptian system of writing being
discarded by a people who possessed the practical habits of traders and merchants. It soon found its way to the mother-country, where the
Egyptian names of the letters were replaced by native ones, drawn
possibly from an older script now termed Hittite, and from the mother-country it was disseminated through the western world.
The Phoenicians iVere the intermediaries of ancient civilisation. It was they who inaugurated the trade of the West, and their trading voyages carried the art, the culture, and the knowledge they themselves possessed to the other nations of the Mediterranean. Modern research has abundantly confirmed the tradition embodied in the opening page of the history of Herodotos, that the chief elements of early Greek art and civilisation came from Assyria through the
hands of the Phoenicians.
But the influence of Phoenicia was exercised differently at different
periods in its history. In the early period the influence was indirect.
It was brought by solitary traders, who trafficked in slaves, and above all in that purple-fish which formed the staple of Phoenician wealth, and whose voyages were intermittent and private. This was the period of what we may call Babylonian culture. The conquests of the Egyptian monarchs of the eighteenth dynasty forced the trading communities of Phoenicia to pay tribute to the empire of the Nile, or at



410 APPENDIX III.
times to join in the efforts made to resist its further progress in
Palestine ; and the result was that Egyptian fashions found their way among them, the sphinx became domesticated on the coast of Keft, and Phoenician art passed into its Egyptianising phase. Meanwhile the population had been increasing along with wealth and prosperity, new regions had been discovered by adventurous voyagers, and experiments
in colonisation had been made on the coasts of Kypros and the Delta. The same mountain-chain which had originally forced the inhabitants of Phoenicia to the sea now induced them to relieve the pressure of popu
lation by sending out organised colonies to the recently-discovered lands
of the west. Commercial marts were accordingly established in favour
able positions; Th§ra and Melos, with their volcanic clay, became centres of Phoenician trade in pottery ; the gold mines of Thasos were worked for Phoenician masters by Greek slaves ; the temple of AstartS rose on the southern headland of Kyth^ra; Lesbos was ruled by Makar or Melkarth, the Tyrian god {II. xxiv. 544), and Kret^ by Minos; the three cities of Khodes were planned by Phoenician architects ; Attika received a Phoenician colony; while the Minyans of Orkhomenos found themselves confronted by the Kadmeians or " Easterns " of Thebes ; and the isthmus of Korinth itself, the key to the western sea, was held by Phoenician lords. But Greece was not to be the furthest bound of
Phoenician colonisation. Settlements were established on the coast
of Africa, in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, and finally the columns
of the Phoenician Herakles themselves were cleared, and the son of Phoenix led a colony to Gadeira, " the walled town," at the very limit
of the setting sun.
The influence exercised by these colonies upon the still barbarous nations of the west was necessarily profound. The Assyrian character of early Greek art is due to its Phoenician inspiration. The pottery with which the sites of ancient cities like Myk^nae and Orkhomenos, or Kameiros in Rhodes, are strewn, was made by the Phoenician potters of Thera and Melos. Megara, Minoa, Coth6n, the " little
"
island by the side of Kythera, are all Phoenician words. The Greek
alphabet, as the forms and names of its letters declare, was a
Phoenician gift. Tradition ascribes it to Kadmos, " the ancient " or
" eastern " of Thebes, the son of Khna or Canaan, or, as other legends affirmed, of Agenor, perhaps a form of Kinyraa His wife, Harmonia, is the Semitic Kharm6n, the " holy " mistress of the Jiarem ; and the serpent into which he was changed is the yepmv oc^twv, the Serpent-god of Tyre, whose image is carved on one of the rocks of Thera. Kad



THE PHCENICIANS. 411
mos himself was worshipped not at Tliebes only, but at Sparta as well, just as Melikertfis or Melkarth remained the deity of the Korinthian isthmus into the historical age. The sacred emblems of the Greek
^m divinities — the myrtle, the pomegranate, and the olive — are plants
^^ that the Phoenicians must have brought with them ; the rites with wliich Demeter Akha^a was worshipped bear a Semitic stamp ; and the attributes of the Hellenic Aphrodite are really those of the Assyrian
Istar, the Phoenician Astarte. Astarte, too, is Eurdpa, the daughter of Phoenix, brought to the continent to which she was to give a name by the bull-formed Phoenician Baal. The Babylonian prototype of the myth of Aphrodite and AdAnis, the Phoenician Adonai, or " lord," has been discovered ; so also have the Babylonian Herakles and his twelve
labours, as recounted in the great Epic of early Chaldea. Sidon seems to have taken the initiative in sending out the colonists. But it was quickly supplanted by Tyre, which claimed supremacy over the cities of Kypros. Arvad and Zemar, however, seem to be the first Phoenician states mentioned on the Egyptian monuments, if they can be identified with the Arathutu and Zemar, whose territories were ravaged by Thothmes III. in his sixth campaign.
Perhaps the land of Son-Tsar, or " the other Tyre," mentioned in an inscription of the reign of Amenophis 11. , refers to the double city of
Tyre; at any rate, insular Tyre was conquered by Seti I. shortly
before his death. His son, Eamses H., at the beginning of his reign,
carved his likeness, in imitation of Sargon of Agad6, on the rocks at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb, and three years later defeated the king
of Arvad, with the other allies of the Hittites, in the battle of Kadesh.
In the age of David Tyre had become the leading city of Phoenicia. Hiram, the son of Abibaal, was the friend of both David and Solomon, who found an alliance with the wealthy trading community of Tyre at once profitable and honourable. Phoenician culture was introduced among the rude tribes of Israel, and the temple of Jerusalem was built by Phoenician artists, after the model of a Phoenician one.
Even the two columns or cones at the entrance, the symbols of the Sun-god, as well as the brazen sea or reservoir, with the twelve solar
bulls on which it rested, were reproduced in the Jewish sanctuary. The conquest of Edom had given David the possession of the Gulf of Akaba, and Tyrian commerce was accordingly able to sail down the Red Sea, hitherto the monopoly of the Egyptians, and find its way to Ophir or Abhlra, at the mouths of the Indus. The name given to the peacocks brought from thence shows that the Dravidian race then



412 ArPENDIX III.
extended thus far north. Insular Tyre was enlarged [and strongly fortified, and the temples of Melkarth and Astarte beautified and restored. After a reign of thirty-four years, Hiram died at the age of fifty-three. His grandson, Abd-Astoreth, was murdered by the sons of
his nurse, the eldest of whom usurped the throne for twelve years. For a while the legitimate dynasty returned to power, but Pheles, a brother of Abd-Astoreth, was put to death by Ethbaal, the priest of Astarte, and with him the line of Hiram came to an end. Ethbaal had a long and prosperous reign of thirty two years. His daughter Jezebel married the king of Israel, and attempted to break down the barrier of religion which separated that country from Phoenicia. Sidon was made subject to the Tyrian sway, and Auza was founded in the
interior of Africa, south of the ancient colony of Ityke. But the first
cloud of danger had already appeared on the horizon. Since the time
of Assur-bil-kala, the son of Tiglath-Pileser I., the name of Assyria had not been heard in the west ; now, however, Assur-natsir-pal marched
into the fastnesses of Lebanon, and in B.C. 870, the kings of Tyre,
Sidon, Gebal, and Arvad offered tribute. Arvad, indeed, almost more intimately connected with Syria than the other states further south, took part in the battle of Aroer against Shalmaneser in B.C. 854.
The great-grandson of Ethbaal was Pygmalion, whose sovereignty in Kypros caused his name to become familiar in Greek story. Seven
years after his accession, at the age of sixteen, he murdered the regent,
his uncle, Sichar-baal, a name corrupted into Akerbas and Sichaeus by
classical writers. His sister Elissa, the wife of Sichar-baal, fled with other opponents of the new king, and found a home on the coast of
Africa, not far from the old Phoenician settlement of Ityke or Utica. The site they chose was named Kartha kJuuhsha, " the new city," a name which has become famous under the form of Carthage. Legends soon gathered round the foundress of the city. She was identified with Dido, the title under which Astarte was worshipped as the consort of the fierce and cruel Moloch ; while Anna, " the gracious," the name of
Astarte as the giver of life and blessing, was made into her sister. Even the Bosrdh or " citadel " of the new state, where a temple rose to
Eshmun, was identified with the Greek (ivpa-a, a "hide," and gave
birth to the myth which told how larbas, the Lybian prince, had been cheated of his land by the ox-hide for which he sold it being cut into strips. Carthago was destined to take the place of Tyre as the mistress of the commerce of the western seas, when the mother city had been ruined by Assyria. Pygmalion's reign lasted for forty-seven



THE PHCENICIANS. 413
years, almost down to the period when Tyre and Sidon paid tribute to Rimmon-nirari III. When next we hear of Tyre it is under Hiram
II., who sent tribute to Tiglath-Pileser II. at Arpad in B.c. 743, and is possibly the King Hiram mentioned on an ancient broken bronze vase found in Cyprus, and deciphered by M. Clermont-Ganneau. His successor, Matgenos II. (Metenna), revolted against Assyria, and was punished by a fine of 150 talents in B.C. 731. On his death, the
Zidonian prince, Elulaeus or Luli, was raised to the Tyrian throne. Hardly was he seated on it when the Assyrian monarch Shalmaneser invaded Phoenicia, and closely besieged Tyre. Sidon, Acre, and
Palaetyros submitted to the invader, but the Assyrian fleet of sixty
vessels was utterly destroyed by the besieged. Tyre did not capitulate till after the accession of Sargon, who was obliged to grant it easy terms. Sidon was soon afterwards compelled to return to its former allegiance. In 701 B.C., however, Sennacherib captured both the
Greater and Lesser Sidon, as well as Sarepta, Achzib, and Acre ; and though he was unable to take Tyre, Elulaeus fled to Kypros, possibly to obtain help. Tubaal or Ethbaal was made king of Sidon, and for a while Sidon became the leading state in Phoenicia. It is to this
period of Sidonian supremacy that the early traditions of historical Greece looked back, and in the Homeric poems the Sidonians, and not
the Tyrians, are the representatives of Phoenicia. The Greeks of Kypros from this time forward know only of Sidon, not of Tyre. But the supremacy of §idon was short-lived. Abd-Melkarth, its king, was misguided enough to ally himself with Sandon-arri of Kilikia, and refuse the homage due to Esar-haddon. Sidon was captured and razed, its prince beheaded, and a new Zidon built, and stocked with
the inhabitants of the old one. The tide of commerce now flowed again into Tyre, and though under Baal I. it joined the Egyptian revolt against Assyria towards the close of Esar-haddon's reign, it was
strong enough to defy all attempts to take it, and Assur-bani-pal was glad to receive its submission on the easy condition of adding the
daughters and nieces of its monarch to the harem at Nineveh. When Tyre again saw an enemy before its walls, it was the Chaldean army under Nebuchadrezzar. But the founder of the Babylonian empire was no more successful than Assur-bani-pal had been, though he joined the island to the mainland by a mole. After a siege of thirteen years, he consented to treat with the Tyrian king, Ethbaal
(b.C. 674), and was thus left free to turn his arms against Egypt On the death of Ethbaal's successor royalty was abolished for a time, and



414 APPENDIX III.
the Tyriana elected Sufetes or Judges ; but in 557 B.C. the old line of kings was again established in the person of Baletor. The conquest of Kypros by Amasis seems to have induced the Phoenicians to recognise the hegemony of Egypt, but with the rise of the Persian empire they passed over to the new power. The Persians, however, who depended on Phoenicia for a fleet, allowed the Phoenician states to be still governed by their own kings, one of whom, Eshmunezer II., thoi son of Tabnith or Tennis, tells us on his sarcophagus that he ruled for fourteen years as " king of the Sidonians," and had built temples to Baal, Astoreth, and Eshmun, and been lord of the rich cornfields of Dor and Jaffa. The maritime experience of the Phoenicians made them indispensable to their Persian masters, and when they refused to attack Carthage, Kambyses was able neither to accomplish his expedition against that city, nor to punish his refractory subjects. Their commercial empire, however, had long since departed. The Dorians had driven them from their possessions in the Greek waters, Ionic sailors
and colonists had followed them to the Pillars of Herakles, the Etruscans had occupied their ports in the Tyrrhene Sea, and Assyria had ruined them at home. Their power passed to Carthage, which in time avenged them upon the Greeks. Sicily and Sardinia once more
became Semitic, the Hellenic states in the former island with difficulty
maintaining their ground against the admirals of Carthage ; while the northern coast of Africa was rendered tributary, and a Carthaginian empire erected in Spain, But while the old strength and spirit of
Phoenicia thus revived in its African colony, the last stronghold of native independence fell before the Greek conqueror Alexander. Tyro was besieged by the army that had just overthrown the Persians at
Issos ; the mole made by Nebuchadrezzar—and still to be seen on the sandy flat which marks the ancient sea-bed between Palaetyros and
insular Tyre—was recpnstructed, and in July B.C. 332 the city, which
had defied Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian, at last fell. Thirty
thousand of its citizens were sold into slavery, thousands of others
were massacred or crucified, and the wealth of the richest and most
luxurious city of the world became the prey of an exasperated army. Its trade was inherited by its neighbour Sidon.
Eeligion and Mythology. —Phoenician religion was typically Semitic.
It centred in the worship of the Sun-god, adored now as the beneficent
giver of light and life, now as the stern god of fire and summer heat, who must be appeased by human sacrifice. Each aspect of the Sungod had its own name, and became a separate divinity. By the side



THE PHOENICIANS. 415
of each stood its reflection and double, that female power presupposed
by all the operations of nature, as well as by the Semitic languages
themselves, with their distinction between masculine and feminine.
Baal, " the lord," therefore, must have his consort Baalath, " lady." But just as Baal was the common title given to the masculine deity in all his forms, so it was rather Ashtoreth than Baalath which was the
common title given to the female deity—a title originally derived from an Accadian source. Ashtoreth was also identified with the moon, the pale consort of the diurnal sun, and, under the name of Astarte, was known to the Greeks as the goddess "with the crescent horns, to whose bright image nightly by the moon Sidonian maidens paid their vows and songs." Greek mythology, too, knew her as 16 and Europa, and she was fitly symbolised by the cow whose horns resemble the supine
lunar crescent as seen in the south. But it was as the female power
of generation—as pale reflections of the Sun-god—that the manifold
goddesses of the popular cult were included among the Ashtaroth or " Ashtoreths " by the side of the Baalim or "Baals." Ashtoreth must be carefully distinguished from Asherah, the goddess of fertility,
symbolised by the ashirim, " upright " cones of stone, or bare treestems, which stood at the entrance of a Phoenician temple. Asherah was more particularly adored among the Canaanites of the south. Baal Samem, " the lord of heaven," called Agenor by the Greeks,
was the supreme Baal of Phoenicia, But it was rather to Baal as the fierce and cruel Molo<;h or Milcom, *' the king," that worship was
specially paid. Moloch demanded the best and dearest that the worshipper could grant him, and the parent was required to offer his
eldest or only son as a sacrifice, while the victim's cries were drowned
by the noise of drums and flutes. When Agathokles defeated the Carthaginians, the noblest of the citizens offered in expiation 300 of
their children to Baal-Moloch. In later times a ram (or hart) was sub
stituted for the human offering, as we learn from the Phoenician
tariff's of sacrifices found at Marseilles and Carthage. The priests scourged themselves or gashed their arms and breasts to win the favour of the god, and similar horrors were perpetrated in the name of Ashtoreth. To her, too, boys and maidens were burned, and young men made themselves eunuchs in her honour. The two aspects of the Sun-god, the baneful and the beneficent, were united in Baal-Melkarth, " the king of the city," the patron god of
Tyre. Melkarth, Graecised into Melikertfis and Makar, is a sure sign of Tynan presence, and his temple at Tyre, where he was invoked as Baal



416 APPENDIX III.
Tsur, was the oldest building of the city. In his passage through the year Melkarth endured all those trials and adventures which Chaldean
poets had told of their great solar hero, and which, under Phoenician
tuition, the Greeks subsequently ascribed to their own HeraklSs.
Herakles, in fact, is but the Tynan Melkarth in a Greek dress, and the
two pillars of rocks which guarded the approach to the ocean the Phoenicians had discovered in the west were rightly termed the columns of Herakles. The temples of Melkarth were said to have been without images, and no women, dogs, or swine were allowed within them. The fire that symbolised him burnt perpetually on his altar, and, under the form of Baal-Khammam, the Ammon of the African Oasis, whom the Greeks confounded with the Egyptian Amun, he was worshipped as the great deity of solar heat which at once creates and destroys. At Carthage the goddess Tanith was his " face " or female reflection. In early times the Sun-god was invoked as El, " god," or " exalted one,"i and El accordingly became a separate divinity. As El Shaddai he was the thunderer, as El Elyon " the most high god," of whom Melchizedek was priest. The rationalising mythology of a later day told how El, the Kronos of Greece, was the founder of Gebal, the first
of Phoenician cities ; how, armed with iron sickle and lance, he had driven his father Uranos (Baal-samem) from the throne ; how, in the
thirty-second year of his reign, he had fertilised the streams by mutilating his sire ; how he had thrown his brother Atlas (Atel, " the dark
ness ") into the nether abyss ; and how in the time of plague he had burnt his " only " son, Yeud, on the altar of Uranos, and circumcised himself and his companions. Yeud (or 'Ekhad) means "the only one," like the Accadian Dumuzi or Tammuz, whose name and worship had been carried to Gebal by the first Phoenician settlers. Under the title of Adonis (Adonai), " master," he was lamented by the women of Byblos in the month of July, when the Nahr Ibrahim runs red with the earth washed down from the mountains. The rivers themselves were worshipped, and, addressed as Baal, were merged into the Sun-god. Thus the Tamyras was adored as Baal-Tamar, called by Philo Zeus Demarfls, the son of Uranos, who
ruled over Phoenicia in the days of El along with Astartc and Ad6do8 or Hadad, " the king of the gods." The mountains, too, were Baalim, the worship of the Sun-god on a mountain-peak being transferred to the

peak itself. On the two mounts Kasios, southward of Antioch, and again to the north of the Sirbonian lake on the African coast, rose the temples of Baal-Zephon, "Baal of the north ;" elsewhjere we find BaalGad, " Baal of good luck," Baal Meon, Baal Hazor, Baal Perazim, Baal-Peor. Peniel, "the face of El," was a mountain deity, and
according to Philo, the fourth divine generation consisted of the giants Kasios, Lebanon, and Hermon, after whom the mountains were named. But the titles and forms under which Baal was adored were not yet exhausted. Sometimes he was known as Baal-Shemesh, "the sun," sometimes as Baal-Zebub, the oracle god of " flies," the sun being imaged as a huge fly ; at other times he was invoked by names as manifold as the local cults and individual caprices of the Canaanitish race. But the fact that it was everywhere the same deity, the same force of Nature, that was worshipped, caused the popular polytheism to tend towards monotheism; the Baalim tended to become Baal, symbolised by a gilded bull. There were, indeed, other dignities recognised by the Phoenicians besides the Baalim and Ashtaroth, of whom, however, we know but little. Among these may be mentioned the Kabeiri, the makers of the
world, the founders of civilisation, and the inventors of ships and
medicine. They were represented as dwarfs, the Greek word for which, irvyfiatoL, was confounded with the name of the Phoenician god Pugm. The most famous of the Kabeiri was Eshmun, " the eighth," identified by the Greeks with their Asklepios, who carried snakes in his hands, and was restored to life by Astronoe or Astoreth Na'amah,
after he had mutilated himself to escape her love. The Kabeiri were
originally the seven planets, and M. J. Darmesteter has tried to show^ that they are on the one side the " sons of God " of Genesis, and on the other the husbands of the Lemnian women, slain, according to the Greek story, by their wives. It is needless to mention other Phoenician deities, such as Sikkun and Mut, " death," of whom we know hardly more than the names. The character of Phoenician religion and of the people who held it was at once impure and cruel. It reflected the sensualism of nature. Intoxicated with the frenzy of nature-worship under the burning sky of the east, the Canaanite destroyed his children, maimed himself, or became the victim of consecrated lust Men and women sought to win the favour of heaven by sodomy and prostitution, and every

woman had to begin life by public prostitution in the temple of Astarte. This practice, indeed, was. brought from Babylonia, along
with the sacrifice of the first-born by fire ; but though we may ascribe
the origin of the latter to tho Accadians, — an Accadian text stating
expressly that sin may be expiated by the vicarious sacrifice of the
eldest son,—the immorality performed in the name of religion was the
invention of the Semitic race itself Up to the last, customs that had originated in a primitive period
of Semitic belief survived in Phoenician religion. Stones, more
especially aerolites, as well as trees, were accounted sacred. The
stones, after being consecrated by a hbation of oil, were called BairvAot,
or Beth-els, " habitations of God," and regarded as filled with the indwelling presence of the Deity. The Caaba at Mecca is a curious
relic of this old Semitic superstition, which is alluded to in the Gisdhubar Epic of Chaldea, and may have suggested the metaphor of a rock applied to the Deity in Hebrew poetry. Prof Robertson Smith, again, has pointed out that numerous traces of an early totemism lasted
down into the historical period of the Semitic race, more especially among the ruder nomad tribes of Arabia. Tribes were named each
after its peculiar totem,—an animal, plant, or heavenly body, —which was worshipped by it and regarded as its protecting divinity. The
division between clean and unclean animals arose out of this ancient
totemism, the totem of a tribe being forbidden to it as food, or eaten
only sacramentally. Exogamy and polyandry almost invariably ac
company totemism, and it is not surprising, therefore, to find clear
traces of both among the Semites. The member of one tribe was required to marry into another. Hence the same family with the
same totem might exist in different tribes, and the ties of the totem
relation were stronger than those of blood. David, for instance,
belonged to the serpent -family, as is shown by the name of his ancestor Nahshon, and Prof Smith suggests that the brazen serpent found by Hezckiah in the Solomonic temple was the symbol of it. We find David and the family of Nahash, or " the serpent," the king of Ammon, on friendly terms even after the deadly war between Israel and Ammon that had resulted in the conquest and decimation of the
latter. One result of the absorbing Baal -worship of Phoenicia, and the tendency to monotheism it produced, was the rationalising of the old myths which took place in the Greek period. Euh^meros had his predecessors in Phoenicia ; in fact, it was from Phoenicia that he



THE PH(ENICIANS. 419
probably derived the principles of his system. In the pages of Philo Byblios the gods became men, and the symbolic legends told of them are changed into human actions. At the same time, with the syncretic
spirit of Phoenician art, the gods and myths of Syria, of Egypt, and of Greece, are all fused together along with those of Phoenicia itself. Two systems of cosmogony are quoted from him, one of which probably belongs to the school of Byblos, the other to that of Tyre. According
to one of these, the wind or breath (Kolpia) brooded over the original chaos (Baau, bohu; Assyrian, Bahu), and produced first Desire and then
Mot, the watery element which underlies all things. M6t, in the form of an egg, generated the universe. Then came the first men, .^on and Protogenos. Their offspring were Genos (Cain) and Genea, who dwelt in Phoenicia and worshipped Baal-Sam^m. Next followed Phos, Pyr, and Phlox, the discoverers of fire ; the giants Kasios, Libanos,
Anti-libanos, and Hermon ; and finally Samim-rum, " the most high," and Usoos (Esau). Samim-rum lived in Tyre, where he built huts and fought with Us6os, the inventor of ships and clothing made of
the skins of wild beasts, who gave his name to the city HosaL Among their descendants were Khus6r, the first worker in iron, and
his brother Meilikhios, the discoverer of fish-hooks, who together invented the art of brickmaking. Afterwards came the husbandman
Agrot^s, Sydyk " the righteous," the father of the Kabeiri, and Uranos
and G6, the children of Elyon and Berytos. One of the sons of the
latter was Dagon, the corn-god, and Astarte was his sister. El, the
son of Uranos, gave Byblos to Beltis, Berytos to the sea-god, the Kabeiri, and the descendants of Agrotes and Halieus; while Egypt fell to Taautos, the Egyptian Thoth.
Art, Science, and Literature. — Phoenician art, as has been stated, was
essentially catholic. It assimilated and combined the art of Baby
lonia, of Egypt, and of Assyria, superadding, perhaps, something of its own, and improving at the same time upon its models. It borrowed the rosette and palm-leaf from Babylonia, the sphinx from Egypt, the cherub from Assyria, but gave to each a form and spirit of its own.
Its gem-cutters came to excel those of Chaldea, its artists in bronze
and stone those of Assyria, while the sarcophagus of Eshmunezer aims at rivalling the massive coffins of Egypt. Its decorative art as well as the plan of its temples can best be learned from the construction and ornamentation of Solomon's temple at Jerusalem. The carved gems and ivories and bronze bowls found at Nineveh, or the treasure
discovered at Palestrina, the ancient Prseneste, are examples of



420 APPENDIX III.
Phoenician workmanship. Everywhere we have the same combination of Assyrian and Egyptian elements, of scenes copied now from Egyptian paintings, now from Assyrian bas-reliefs, sometimes mingled together,
sometimes divided into separate zones. If we may listen to M. Clermont-Ganneau, the central medallion of the sculptured bowls gave the first idea of money ; at any rate, we know that the bronze vessels of Phoenicia were frequently broken up for the purposes of exchange.
In the early art of Greece, and above all in the art of Kypros, we
may trace the outlines and spirit of the art of Phoenicia. We shall see hereafter, however, that Phoenician art was but one element in the art
of primitive Greece, though it was the most important one ; the other element being the art long supposed to be peculiar to Asia Minor, but
now traceable to the Hittites. But this element was naturally weaker on the Grecian mainland, which owed even its alphabet to the
Phoenicians, than in the islands. A bronze plate like that recently found at Olympia, the lowest compartment of which is occupied by a figure of the winged A starts, or the pottery of Mykenae and other
prehistoric sites, are the products of Phoenician rather than of Hellenic skill. The so-called Korinthian or Phoeniko-Greek vases, with their quaint animal forms and Babylonian rosettes, belong to that
transition period when Phoenician art was passing into Greek. The
patterns upon them owe their inspiration to the embroidered dresses for which Th^ra was long famous. The earliest attempts at statuary in Greece are Assyro-Phoenician, as may be seen from the statues discovered by General di Cesnola at Golgoi in Kypros, or the sitting figures disentombed by Mr. Newton at Brankhidge ; and it seems difficult to believe that the genius of Athens so soon transformed these stiff models of the Orient into the marvellous creations of a Pheidias or
a Praxiteles. But the art of Homer is still Phoenician in character ; the shield of Akhilles might have been wrought by one of the artists who have left us the bronze bowls of Nineveh.
In science Phoenicia inherited the discoveries and inventions of its
neighbours. Glass, according to Pliny, had been an invention of the Phoenicians, but it was known to the Egyptians long before the Phoenicians had emerged from their primitive barbarism.^ In the art of navigation, however, the Phoenicians no doubt made an independent advance. The gavlos, with its high rounded prow and stem, the fiftyoar galley, and " the ship of Tarshish," or merchantman, were the
1 The earliest dated specimen of Egyptian glass bears the name of Antef III., of the eleventh dynasty.



THE PHCENICIANS. 421
oldest of their vessels, and the Byhlians were held to be the best shipbuilders, the men of Sidon and Arvad being the best rowers. It was at Carthage that a ship with more than three banks of oars was first
built, and its pilots steered by the pole-star, not like the Greeks by the Great Bear. The Phoenician galley seems to have been the model of the Greek one. As for medicine, a Phoenician of Gebal was one of the most famous of oculists in the time of the eighteenth dynasty, and
even the Egyptian doctors did not disdain to make use of his receipts.
The renown of the Phoenicians as builders and carpenters implies their
knowledge of mechanics and the use of the lever and pulley. But their buildings have mostly perished, and so, too, has their
literature. All that we possess are the scanty quotations, chiefly by Josephos, from the history of Tyre by Dios and MSnander of Ephesos, who seem to have derived it from the native annals ; references to Mokhos, Moskhos, or Okhos, who wrote on Phoenician history, and is
made by Strabo, on the authority of Poseidonios, to have lived before the Trojan War, and started the atomic theory; and, above all, the
fragments of Philo Byblius, who flourished in the second century B.C. and professed to have translated into Greek older works by Sanchuniathon and others on Phoenician history and religion. Sanchuniathon
(Sikkun-yitten) is said to have been one of a series of hierophants, among whom Thabion and Isiris may be named, and to have lived, like Mokhos, before the war of Troy. His works were based on tho archives preserved in the temples, a book composed by Hierombaal or Jerubbaal in the days of Abelbaal, king of Berytos, and the sacred scriptures of Taautos and Eshmun. If, however, Sanchuniathon had any real existence, he must have written but shortly before the time
of Philo himself, since the cosmogony and theology of the latter is
wholly the product of a syncretic and rationalising age. The works of Mokhos, as well as two other Phoenician writers, Hyksikrat^s and Theodotos (? Sanchuniathon), are said to have been translated into Greek by a certain Khaitos. It may be added that the Carthaginian general Mago was the author of twenty -eight books on agriculture, turned into Greek by Dionysios of Utica, and into Latin by Silanus
;
and Hanno of an account of his voyage along the west coast of Africa,
in the course of which he fell in with a " savage people " called gorillas.
Government and Trade.—The government of the several states was a monarchy tempered by an oligarchy of wealth. The king seems to have been but the first among a body of ruling merchant princes and still more powerful and wealthy chiefs. In time the monarchy disap

peared altogether, its place being supplied by suflfetes or "judges," whose term of office lasted sometimes for a year, sometimes for more,
sometimes even for life. At Carthage the suflfetes were two in number, who were merely presidents of the senate of thirty. The power of the senate was subsequently checked by the creation of a board of
one hundred and four chosen by self-electing committees of five, to
whom the judges, senate, and generals were alike accountable. By providing that no member of the board should hold office for two years running, Hannibal changed the government into a democracy. The colonies of Phoenicia were permitted to manage their own affairs
so long as they paid tribute and supplied ships and soldiers to the mother city, though their inhabitants were allowed no rights or
privileges in Phoenicia itself Many of them, however, were wholly
independent, governed by their own kings, and benefiting Phoenicia
only in the way of trade.
The cities of Phoenicia were, in fact, the first trading communities
the world had seen. Their power and wealth, and even their existence, depended on commerce. Their colonies were originally mere marts, and their voyages of discovery were undertaken in the interests of
trade. The tin of Britain, the silver of Spain, the birds of the
Canaries, the frankincense of Arabia, the pearls and ivories of India,
all flowed into their harbours. But the purple trade was the staple of
their industry. It was by the help of the murex or purple-fish that
they had first become prosperous, and when the coasts of Palestine could no longer supply sufficient purple for the demands of the world,
they made their way in search of it to the coasts of Greece, of Sicily, and of Africa. The purple manufactories of Tyre must always have
spoilt a traveller's enjoyment of the place. Slaves, too, formed part
of Phoenician traffic from the earliest times, as also did pottery. The
copper of Kypros was no doubt their attraction to that island, and, mixed with the tin of Britain and the Caucasus, it became the bronze for which they were famous. In mining they excelled, and the gold mines of Thasos, where, according to Herod otos, Ihey had "overturned a whole mountain," were worked before the thirteenth century B.C. Their woven and embroidered garments, dyed crimson and violet, were sent all over the civilised world. The weights and measures they used were borrowed from Babylonia, and passed over to Greece along with the ancient Accadian name of the mina or maund.^ At Carthage we

hear of loans made from foreign states, and, along with bars of gold and silver, even of a token-money, like our bank-notes, which had no intrinsic value of its own. The revenues were derived chiefly from the customs, and were largely expended upon the mercenaries, who formed the bulk of the army. The citizens themselves preferred to
serve on ship-board.

LYDIA.
Lydia is the link that binds together the geography and history of Asia and Europe. It occupied the western extremity of that great peninsula of Asia Minor, 750 miles in length and 400 in breadth, which runs out from the mountains of Armenia and divides the nations of the north from the happier inhabitants of a southern clime. The broad plains of the Hermos and Kayster, in which the Lydian monarchy grew up, are the richest in Asia Minor, and the mountain chains by
which they are girdled, while sufl&ciently high to protect them, form
cool and bracing sites for cities, and are rich in minerals of various kinds. The bays of Smyrna and Ephesos formed incomparable harbours ; here the products of the inland could be safely shipped and carried past the bridge of islands which spans the ^gean to tho
nations of tlie West Asia Minor, naturally the richest of countries
and blessed with an almost infinite diversity of climates, finds, as it
were, in the ancient territory of Lydia the summing-up of its manifold
perfections and characteristics. Rightly, therefore, did the loamy
plain of the Kayster give its name of Asian ^ to the rest of the peninsula of which it formed the apex. This peninsula is cut in two by the
Halys, which flows from that part of the Taurus range—the western
spur of the Armenian mountains—which -overlooks the eastern basin of the Mediterranean and forms the background of Kilikia. This geographical division had an influence on the ethnology of the country. As Asia Minor was but a prolongation of Armenia, so too, originally, its population was the same as that which in prehistoric days inhabited the Armenian plateau. From hence it spread westward and southward, down the slopes of the mountains, under the various names of Hittites, Moschi and Tibareni, Komagenians, Kappadokians, and the

424 APPENDIX IV.
lik& We may term it Proto-Armenian, and see in the Georgians its modern representatives, though doubtless the Circassians and other
half-extinct races, which, before the Russian conquest, found a refuge in
the fastnesses of the Caucasus, once had their share in populating the neighbouring regions. But a time came when Aryan tribes forced their way along the northern shore of the Caspian, across the Ural mountains, and into the plains of Southern Russia and Central Germany, and when some of them penetrated yet further into the lands afterwards known as Thrak^ and Greece. From Thrake they sailed across the Hellespont, and one tribe at least, the Briges or " Free-men,"
occupied so large a tract of country as to give their name to Phrygia. Other tribes found their way across the ^gean from Greece itself, and
under the general title of lonians or "emigrants" established them
selves on the more accessible parts of the western coast of Asia Minor, where they were joined in the later days of the Dorian conquest by other emigrants from their old home. The older settlers intermarried with the native population and formed in many districts a mixed race. If we might argue from language alone, we should infer that the Phrygians, Mysians, and Lydians were not only Aryans, but more closely allied to the Hellenic stock than any other members of the Aryan family, the Lykians and possibly the Karians alone belonging to the old population. But language can prove no more than social
contact ; it can give us but little clue to the race of the speakers ; and
other facts go to show that the Phrygians alone could claim a fairly pure Aryan ancestry, the Mysians and Lydians being essentially mixed. But the Aryans never passed eastward of the Halys; the Assyrian inscriptions make it clear that as late as the seventh century RC. a non-Aryan population still held the country between that river and Media. It was only when the stream of emigration had brought the Aryan Medes into Media, and the Aryan Persians into Elam, that Aryans also forced their way into Armenia, changed the Zimri of the Assyrian inscriptions into Aryan Kurds, and planted the colony of
the Iron or Ossetes in the Caucasus itself. The Proto-Armenian race has left memorials of itself in the monuments and inscriptions of Lake Van and its neighbourhood. In the ninth century B.C. it borrowed the characters of the Assyrian syllabary, selecting those only which were needed to express the sounds of its language ; and the line of monarchs that then ruled at Dhuspas, the modem Van, showed themselves to be able administrators and good
generals. Menuas, Argistis, and Sar-duris II., all added to the king



I

dom, and brought the barbarous tribes of the north and east under their more civilised domination. The gods they worshipped were numerous : Khaldis the supreme god, Teisbas the air-god, Ardinis the sun-god, and Selardis the moon-god, standing at the head. There were,
in fact, as many Khaldises as there were local cults ; and an inscrip
tion of Isbuinis, the father of Menuas, distinguishes four of them by
name. The dress of the people consisted of a long fringed robe which
reached to the ankles, or of a short tunic resembling that worn by the Greeks, over which an embroidered cloak was sometimes thrown. The short tunic was worn by the soldiers, whose helmets so closely resemble those of the Greeks as to confirm the statement of Herodotos
(L 171) that the Greeks derived the crests that adorned them from the Karians. A short dirk was slung in the belt, and the hands were armed with a small round shield and a long spear. The most peculiar part of the dress, however, were the boots with the ends turned up, such as are still worn by the mountaineers of Asia Minor and Greece.
They indicate the cold and hilly region in which their inventors lived. The head was covered sometimes by a close-fitting cap, sometimes by a lofty tiara, sometimes by the Phrygian cap ; and the double-headed
axe which characterised the aboriginal populations of Asia Minor, and gave a name to Zeus Labrandeus, " Zeus with the double-headed axe," worshipped in Karia, was also used by them. The language of the
Vannic inscriptions, as th'ey are termed, may, like Georgian, be called
inflectional, though it is neither Aryan nor Semitic. The language
revealed by the bilingual inscriptions of Lykia is of the same character. The most important branch of the Proto-Armenian race were the Hittites, who established themselves in the heart of the Semitic territory, and founded an empire which contended on equal terms with Egypt, and once extended its sway as far as the ^gean. Its two capitals were Kadesh, on an island in the Orontes, and Carchemish,
now Jerablfts, the classical Hierapolis, on the Euphrates, about sixteen
miles south of Birejik. A Hittite tribe even succeeded in settling in the south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Hebron, which, like
Jerusalem, would have been a Hittite foundation if Mariette is right in making the leaders of the Hyksos dynasties Hittites. But the Semites gradually managed to push the Hittites to the north, whence they had come. Kadesh, the southern capital, fell into Syrian hands, and before the reign of Solomon Hamath also had ceased to belong to them. As
late, however, as the eighth century B.C. the allied tribe of Patinians
extended from the gulf of Antioch to Aleppo, where the territory of the



426 APPENDIX IV.
Hittite princes of Carchemish and Pethor (at the junction of the Sajur and Euphrates) commenced.^ But the Patinians were conquered by Tiglath-Pileser II., and the fall of Carchemish in B.C. 717, when
Sargon put its last king, Pisiris, to death and made it the seat of an
Assyrian satrap, marked the final victory of the Semitic race. The
Hittite empire, while it lasted, had done much for civilisation. The
Hittites invented a system of hieroglyphic writing, suggested doubtless by that of Egypt, and the art developed at Carchemish was a peculiar combination and modification of early Babylonian and Egyptian, in which, however, the Babylonian elements much preponderated. This art, along with the accompanying culture and writing, was carried by them into Asia Minor, which they overran and subdued. They have left memorials of their empire there in the sculptures of Boghaz Keui and Eyuk in Kappadokia, of Ivrls in Lykaonia, of Ghiaur Kalessi in Phrygia, and of Karabel and " the Niobg " of Sipylos in Lydia. The two figures at Karabel which Herodotos, after his visit to Egypt,
imagined to be those of Sesostris, were really those of the bitterest enemies of Egypt, and the hieroglyphics which accompanied them were the hieroglyphics, not of Thebes, but of Carchemish. The monuments
were erected as sign-posts to the travellers through the pass, and as witnesses that the power which carved them was mistiess of Ephesos,
of Smyrna, and of Sardes. The date of this westward extension of the Hittite empire may be
fixed from the fifteenth to the thirteenth centuries B.C. Though the Hittites are mentioned in the work on Babylonian astronomy compiled for Sargon of Agad^, they are unknown to the Egyptian monuments till the reign of Thothmes III. In the time of Ramses II. they are able to summon to their aid not only the Kolkhians, but also the Masu or Mysians and the Dardani of the Troad, Avith their towns, Iluna or Ilion and Pidasa or Pedasus, showing that at that period their power in the extreme west was unimpaired. But it seems to have
decayed soon afterwards, though, according to Tiglath-Pileser I. (B.C.
1130), the Hittites in his time still held possession of Semitic Syria,
garrisoning it with Kolkhian soldiers. The legend reported by Herodotos which makes the founder of the Herakleid dynasty of Lydia the son of Ninos, and grandson of Belos, may possibly be an echo of the fact that Carchemish was called Ninus Fetus, " the old Nineveh "
* The district occupied by the Pati- rivers," from which Kirgipa, the daughter nians is called in the Egyptian Inscrip- of King Satarona, was brought as a gift tions the land of Nahraina or " the two to Thi, the wife of Amenophis III.

(Amm. Marcell. xiv. 8 ; DioA ii. 3, 7), and that its culture had come from the land of Bel. At all events, the Herakles or Sandon who wedded Omphale, the daughter of lardanos, and from whom the dynasty derived its name, is the Babylonian sun-god, as modified by Hittite belief, Omphale being perhaps the Hittite name of the Asiatic
goddess.^ There were other legends which connected Lydia with the Euphrates; and these were supposed to point to an Assyrian conquest of the country before the Assyrian inscriptions themselves had told us that the Assyrians never passed westward of the Halys, much less knew the name of Lydia, until the age of Assur-bani-pal. The art and culture, the deities and rites, which Lydia owed to Babylonia were brought by the hands of the Hittites, and bore upon them a Hittite stamp. It is
with the Hittite period, so strangely recovered but the other day, that
Lydian history begins. The legends of an earlier epocli given by the native historian Xanthos, according to the fragments of Nikolas of Damascus, are mere myths and fables. The first Lydian dynasty of Atyads was headed by Attys and the moon-god Manes or M§n, and included geographical personages like Lydos, Asios, and Meles, or such heroes of folklore as Kamblet^s, who devoured his wife, and Tylon, the
son of Omphale, who was bitten by a snake, but restored to life by a marvellous herb. Here and there we come across faint reminiscences of the Hittite supremacy and the struggle which ended in its overthrow ; Akiamos, the successor of the good king Alkimos, sent Askalos or Kayster, the brother of Tantalos, to conquer Syria ; and Moxos (or Mopsos) marched into the same region, where he took Atargatis, the goddess of Carchemish, captive, and threw her into the sacred lake. It is probable that the Herakleidae were at the outset the Hittite
satraps of Sardes, whose power increased as that of the distant empire declined, and who finally made themselves independent rulers of the Lydian plain. According to Herodotos, Agr6n, called Agelaos by Apollodorus, Kleodaios or Lamos by Diodfiros, was the first of the Herakleids, whose rule lasted for 505 years. Xanthos, however, was
doubtless more correct in making Sadyatt^s and Lixos the successors of
^ According to Eusebios, Sardea was the Eimmerians in later days. When first captured by Kimmerian invaders Strabo says that Lygdamis with a horde tliree centuries before the first Olympiad of Kimmerians made his way to Lydia (b.c. 1078).

Tyldn, the son of OmphaR The dynasty ended with KandaulSs, the twenty-second prince. Gyges, called Gugu in the Assyrian inscriptions, Gog in the Old Testament, who seems to have been of Karian descent, put him to death, and established the dynasty of the Mermnadse about B.C. 690.^ Gyggs extended the Lydian dominion as far as the Helles
pont, though he was unsuccessful in his attempt to capture the Ionic port of Old Smyrna. Towards the middle of his reign, however, Lydia was overrun by the Kimmerians, the Gimirrai of the Assyrian texts, the Gomer of the Old Testament, who had been driven from their ancient seats on the sea of Azof by an invasion of Skythians, and thrown upon Asia Minor by the defeat they suffered at the hands of Esar-haddon on the northern frontier of the Assyrian empire. The Greek colony of Sin6p6 was sacked, and the fame of the barbarian hordes penetrated to Hellenic lands, where the redactor of the Odyssey, the Homer whom Theopompos and Euphorion make a contemporary of Gyg^s, spoke of them ^ as still in the misty region of the eastern Euxine. The lower town of Sardes itself was taken by the Kimmerians, who were mentioned by Kallinos, the Greek poet of Ephesos
;
and Gyg^s in his extremity turned to the power which alone had been able to inflict defeat on the barbarian hordes. Accordingly an embassy was sent to Assur-bani-pal ; Lydia consented to become the tributary of Assyria, and presents were made to the great king, including two Kimmerian chieftains whom Gyg^s had captured with his own hand. It was some time before an interpreter could be found for the ambassadors. The danger passed, and the Lydian king shook off his allegiance, aiding Egypt to do the same. But Assyria was soon avenged. Once more the Kimmerians appeared before Sardes, Gyges
was slain and beheaded in battle after a reign of thirty-eight years, and
his son Ardys IL again submitted to be the vassal of Sardanapallos. Upon this occasion Sardes seems to have fallen a second time into the hands of its enemies, an event alluded to by KallisthenSs. Alyatt^s
III., the grandson of Ardys, finally succeeded in extirpating the Kimmerian scourge, as well as in taking Smyrna, and thus providing his kingdom with a port. Lydia rapidly progressed in power and
prosperity ; its ships trafficked in all parts of the ^gean, and its kings
sent offerings to Delphi and affected to be Greek. It remained for
Krcesos, however, the son of Alyatt^s, to carry out the policy first planned by Gyg^s, and make himself suzerain of the wealthy trading

cities of Ionia. They were allowed to retain their own institutions and government on condition of recognising the authority of the Lydian monarch, and paying customs and dues to the imperial exchequer. With the commerce of Ionia and the native treasures of Lydia alike at his command, Krcesos became the richest monarch of his age. He reigned alone only fifteen years, but he seems to have
shared the royal power for several years previously with his father. All the nations of Asia Minor as far as the Halys owned his sway. He was on friendly terms with the states of Greece, with Babylonia, and with Media. In fact, Astyages of Media was his brother-in-law, his sister Ary^nis having been married to Astyages in order to cement the treaty between Alyattes and Kyaxares, brought about (in B.C. 585),
after six years of fighting, by the kindly oflSces of the Babylonian king,
and the intervention of the eclipse foretold by Thales. Th e Lydian
empire, however, did not long survive the fall of the Median empire. Kyros and Krcesos met in battle on the banks of the Halys about B.C. 645,^ and though the engagement was indecisive it was followed
by a winter campaign of the Persians, which resulted in the defeat of
the Lydians before they could summon their allies to their aid, and
the capture of^ Sardes and its citadel. The vulnerable spot was believed to be where the legendary monarch Mel^s had failed to carry the lion, which was a symbol "alike of Hittite and of Lydian power
;
but it was really the path made by one of those ever-recurring landslips which have reduced the crumbling sandstone cliflf of the Acropolis
to a mere shell, and threaten in a few years to obliterate all traces of
the ancient citadel of the Lydian kings.
Religion and Mythology. —The religion of Lydia, as of the rest of Asia Minor, was profoundly influenced by that of Babylonia after the modification it had undergone at Carchemish. The Hittites had received the religious conceptions of Chaldea, along with the germs of
art and culture, before the rise of Assyria ; it is Babylonia, therefore, and not Assyria, that explains them. The Babylonian Nana became the goddess of Carchemish, where in the days of Semitic ascendency she was known as Atargatis and Derketo. The Babylonian sun-god passed into Sanddn of Kilikia and Lydia, the Baal-Tars or Baal of Tarsos of the Aramaic coins. Even the Chaldean story of the Deluge was transplanted to "the sacred city" of Carchemish, the ship becoming an ark, Xisuthros SisythSs, and the mountain of Nizir a pool
^ Eusebios makes it B.C. 546, but this is probably a year or two too soon.



430 APPENDIX IV.
in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates. From hence the legend was passed on to Apamea, and possibly other towns of Asia Minor as well. The form and worship of Atargatis were similarly carried west
ward. The terra-cotta images of Nana, which represent the goddess as nude, with the hands upon the breast, may be traced through Asia Minor into the islands of the -^gean, and even into Greece itself. Dr. Schliemann has found them at Hissarlik, where the "owl-headed" vases are adorned with representations of the same goddess, and they occur plentifully in Kypros. At Carchemish they underwent two different modifications. Sometimes the goddess was provided with a conical cap and four wings, which branched out behind the back ; sometimes she was robed in a long garment, with the modius or mural crown upon the head. Terra-cotta statues of her, discovered by Major di Cesnola in Cyprus, set under the mural crown a row of eagles, like the double-headed eagle which appears in the Hittite sculptures at Boghaz Keui and Eyuk. At times the mural crown becomes the polos, as in the images disinterred at Mykense and Tanagra
;
at other times the body of the deity takes the shape of a cone, or rather of the aerolite which symbolised her at Troy, at Ephesos, and
elsewhere, while the surface is thickly covered with breasts. It was under this latter form, and with the mural crown upon the head, that
the Hittite settlers in Ephesos represented the divinity they had brought with them. Here the bee was sacred to her, and her
priestesses were called " bees," while the chief priest was ea-an'jvy " the king bee." The bee is similarly employed on Hittite gems, and a gem found near Aleppo represents Atargatis standing on the insect. The Hittite priestesses who accompanied the worship of the goddess as it spread through Asia Minor were known to Greek legend
as Amazons. The cities founded by Amazons — Ephesos, Smyrna,
Kym^, Myrina, Pri^n^, Pitane—were all of Hittite origin. In early ai*t the Amazons are robed in Hittite costume and armed with the double-headed axe, and the dances they performed with shield and bow in honour of the goddess of war and love gave rise to the myths which saw in them a nation of woman-warriors. The Therm6d6n, on whose banks the poets placed them, was in the neighbourhood of the Hittite monuments of Boghaz Keui and Eyuk, and at Komana in Kappadokia the goddess Ma was served by 6000 ministers. By the side of Atargatis or Ma, the Ephesian Artemis, called also Kybel^, Kyb^b^ and Amma, stood the sun-god Attys or Agdistis, at once the son and bridegroom of the " great goddess " of Asia. Among



LYDIA. 431
the Phrygians he was named Papas or "father," and invoked as "the shepherd of the bright stars," a title which reminds us of the Accadian name of the star Arcturus. Attys was symbolised by the fir-tree into which he had been changed after mutilating himself to avoid the love of Kybele. He is, in fact, the Semitic Adonis ; or rather, just as the old Hittite goddess assumed the attributes and functions of the Babylonian Nana, so, too, Attys took upon him the character of Tammuz or Adonis. The rites with which Istar and Tammuz had been worshipped at Babylon were transferred first to Carchemish and then to Asia Minor. The prostitution by which Atargatis was honoured
was paralleled by the mutilation and self-torture practised in the name of Attys. His untimely death was mourned by women like the death
of Tammuz, and his galli or priests were all eunuchs. At Pessinus, where each was termed an Attys, the chief priest had the title of
archigallos.
But underneath these imported religious conceptions and rites lay the old nature -worship of the natives of Armenia and Asia Minor. The frenzy that marked the cult of Attys or of Zeus Sabazios in Phrygia, the wild dances, the wanderings in the pine-woods, the use of cymbals and tambourines, the invention of which was ascribed to Asia Minor, were all of older date than the period of Babylonian and
Semitic influence. The story'of Apollo and the Phrygian flute-player Marsyas, the follower of Kybel^, may imply that the Aryan occupa
tion of Phrygia exorcised the wild and exciting spirit of the native music and of the worship to which it was consecrated. At any rate,
as the language of the Phrygian inscriptions proves, the non-Arjan element in the population of that part of Asia Minor was reduced to insignificance, and the supreme god of the country became the Aryan
Bagaios. The close connection between Phrygia and Hellas is shown by the early mythology of Greece. Phrygian heroes like Gordios and Midas
form as integral a part of Greek story as do the heroes and poets of Thrake. It is difi"erent with those other lands of Asia Minor which enter into Greek legend. The plain of Troy was rendered famous by the struggles made by the Akhsean fugitives from the Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesos to gain a foothold in ^olis; the immemorial story of the storming of the sky by the bright powers of day, which had been localised in Thebes, where Greeks and Phoenicians had
contended for possession, being again localised by Akheean poets in the land of their adoption. SarpMdn, the Lykian hero, was celebrated



432 APPENDIX IV.
in Ionic song, because Apollo Lykios, " the god of light," had been
associated with the eastern hills behind which the light-bringing sungod rose each morning for the Hellenic settlers on the coast ; and the tales that grew around the names of Tant.alos and Pelops enshrined a real tradition of the day when Hittite culture and Lydian wealth came to the feudal lords of Myk^nae from the golden sands of the
Pakt61os.
Art and Literature. —Hittite art was a modification of the art of
early Babylonia, though the sphinxes at Eyuk, the Hittite form of the
fwoher or winged solar disk, and the scarabs found in the neighbourhood of Aleppo, show that Egypt had also exercised an influence upon
it. It was characterised by solidity, roundness, and work in relief.
The mural crown was a Hittite invention, and the animal forms, in
which the Hittite artists specially excelled, were frequently combined to form composite creatures, among which may be mentioned the double-headed eagle, afterwards adopted by the Seljukian sultans, and
carried by the crusaders to the German states. This Hittite art is the source of the peculiar art of Asia Minor, which forms a well-marked
element in that of primitive Greece. The famous sculpture at Myk^nse,
over the gate to which it has given its name, finds its analogue in a
similar heraldic sculpture above a rock-tomb at Kumbet, in the valley of the Sangarios ; and the tombs of Midas and other Phrygian kings
in the same spot exhibit the architectural devices, the key pattern, and other kinds of ornamentation which we meet with in the early art
of Greece. An archaic lion's head from Sardes, built into a wall at
Akhmetlu, forms a link between the lions of Hittite sculpture on the one side, and the lions found among the niins of ^Mykense on the
other. The lentoid gems, again, discovered in the islands of the
Archipelago, in Krete, at the Hereeon of Argos, and on other pre
historic sites, are all closely allied in artistic style to the Hittite
carved stones which owe their inspiration to the archaic gems of
Babylonia. Still more nearly Hittite in character are the engraved
cylinders and seals of chalcedony, and similar stones, brought from
Kypros and from Lydia itself. Long supposed to be rude imitations of Phoenician workmanship, they now turn out to be engraved after Hittite models. They were, indeed, ultimately derived from the art of Babylonia, but through the northern, and not through the southern, channel. It is possible that the gold chatons of rings engraved in
imitation of archaic Babylonian patterns, and found by Dr. Schliemann at Myk^nse, may have made their way into Argolis, not directly from



LYDIA. 433
tlie Babylonians at the time when Sargon of Agadd carried his arms as far as Kypros, but through the intervention of the Hittites, since the double-headed battle-axe of Asia Minor is introduced upon one of them, and a row of animals' heads in true Hittite style appears upon
the other.
Greek tradition remembered that Karians as well as Phoenicians had brought the West the culture of the East. Karian tombs were discovered in Delos when the island was purified by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War.^ The Greek helmet, a Karian gift, may be ultimately traced back to the warriors of Armenia, and the emblems
of the shield to which Herodotos ascribes a Karian origin were possibly at the outset the hieroglyphics of Hittite writing. Dr. Kohler once wished to see in the rock-tombs of Spata (perhaps the Attic deme of Sphettos), the resting-places of Karian dead ; and though the discovery of similar remains in Rhodes, in the tomb of Menidi in Attica, at Myk^nae, and elsewhere, shows that the sepulchres themselves belonged to Greek natives, and that their contents mostly exhibit
Phoenician influence and trade, yet there are certain objects like an ivory human head crowned with the Hittite tiara which refer us unmistakably to Asia Minor. The butterfly which occurs so plentifully at Mykenae, and of which specimens, conventionally treated, may be seen on the glass ornaments of Menidi,^ came more probably from Asia Minor than from Phoenicia. On the other hand, the gold masks with which the faces of the dead were covered seem to be of Phoenician derivation, since they were suggested by the gilded mummy faces of the Egyptians, who sometimes used gold masks besides, as is evidenced by the golden mask of Prince Kha-em-Uas of the eighteenth dynasty, now in the Louvre, while the corpse of a child covered with a mask of gold has been disinterred at Arvad.
Silver was the metal which more especially attracted the Hittites. Their monuments in Asia Minor are chiefly in the neighbourhood of silver mines, which they were the first to work. The Hittite copy of the treaty with Ramses II. was accompanied by a plate of silver, with
a likeness of the god Sutekh in the middle, and an inscription running round it. A similar circular plate has been found, which apparently covered the handle of a dirk, with a figure of a king in the centre, a
Hittite inscription twice repeated on either side, and a cuneiform legend running round the rim. These circular silver disks, with an

434 APPENDIX IV.
image in the middle, and an inscription surrounding it, very probably
suggested the idea of coined money, which was primarily of silver, and
the invention of which was ascribed to the Lydians. The practice of
using silver as a writing material seems to have been general among the Hittite tribes. M. Renan has found niches cut in the rocks of
Syria which would fit the written silver-plates of the Hittites as
depicted on the monuments of Egypt, and the Hittite hieroglyphics
are always carved in relief, even when the material is hard stone.
These hieroglyphics were of native invention, though probably suggested by the sight of Egyptian writing. The Egyptian monuments
speak of Khilip-sira, " the writer of books of the vile Kheta," and
Kirjath-sepher, or "book town," was one of their settlements in Southern Palestine. They carried their writing with them into the
furthest extremity of Asia Minor—one of the pseudo-Sesostres in the
pass of Karabel having a Hittite inscription still legible upon it, and
out of it, apparently, was formed a syllabary, which we may term Asianic. This syllabary was in use throughout Asia Minor before the
introduction of the simpler Phoenician alphabet, and a local branch of
it was employed in conservative Kypros as late as the fourth or third
century B.C. Elsewhere we find it only on objects discovered by Dr. Schliemann in the lower strata of Hissarlik, though certain characters
belonging to it were retained in historical times in the various Asianic
alphabets—Kappadokian, Mysian, Lydian, Lykian, Karian, Pamphylian,
and Kilikian —to express sounds not represented by the letters of the
Ionic alphabet. As the latter alphabet still contained the digamma when it superseded the older syllabary, its adoption could not have been later than the middle of the seventh century RC. Lydian literature has wholly perished, though the fragments of the native historian, Xanthos, prove that annals had been kept for some
generations at least previous to the accession of the Mermnada; ; and
we may infer from the Babylonian character and colouring of the
earliest Ionic philosophies that Lydian writers had already made the
philosophic ideas of the far East familiar to their countrymen.
Trade. —Lydia was essentially a trading community. But just as the complexion of the Babylonian culture brought by the Hittites to the
West differed from that brought by the Phoenicians in being carried overland by conquerors, and in therefore being more penetrating and
permanent, so too the industi'ial character of the Lydians diff"ered from
that of the Phoenicians. Their trade was an inland, not a maritime one. Sardes was the meeting-place of the caravans that journeyed from the



LYDIA. 436
interior along the two high-roads constructed by the Hittites, —the one traversed by Krcesos when he marched against Kyros, and leading by Ghiaur-KalessL and Ancyra to Boghaz Keui; the other, afterwards used by Xenophon and the Ten Thousand, which ran southwards through Lykaonia and Ikonion, and after passing through the Kilikian Gates, joined the thoroughfare from Carchemish to Antioch and the
bay of Scanderftn. Unlike Phoenicia, moreover, Lydia was rich in its own resources. Gold, emery, and other minerals were dug out of its
mountains ; its plains were luxuriant beyond description ; its hill-sides
clothed with thick forests. The policy of the Mermnadae was to make their state the industrial centre of East and West. The conquest of the Ionian cities which had succeeded to the commercial empire of the Phoenicians threw into their hands the trade of the Mediterranean, and Abydos was occupied by Gyg^s in order to command the entrance to the comlands of the Euxine. Pamphaes of Ephesos was the banker of Kroesos, and money was coined for the first time by the Lydian kings. The standard, as Mr. Barclay Head has shown, was the silver "mina of Carchemish," as the Assyrians called it, the Babylonian, as it was termed by the Greeks, which contained 8656 grains. This standard, originally derived by the Hittites from Babylonia, but modified by themselves, was passed on to the nations of Asia Minor during the epoch of Hittite conquest, and from them was received by
Pheidon of Argos and the Greeks. The standard, it will be observed,
was a silver, and not a gold one, silver being the favourite Hittite
metal. Six small silver bars, each originally weighing the third part of the "Babylonian" mina, were discovered by Dr. Schliemann at Hissarhk, and the standard was that according to which the electron coins of Gyg^s were struck. Little by little, however, it was superseded by the heavier Phoenician mina of 11,225 grains, also, no doubt, primitively of Babylonian origin. Thrak^, Lydia, and the western and southern coasts of Asia Minor, all adopted the new standard, and it was only in conservative Kypros and on the neighbouring
shores of Kilikia that the old mina remained in use down to the age
of Alexander the Great.



436 APPENDIX V.
THE PERSIAN EMPIRK
Persia proper, roughly corresponding to the modern province of Farsistan, was comparatively a small district, about 450 miles in length by 250 in breadth. Eastward it touched on Kerman or Karamania, westward it was bounded by Susiana, southward by the Persian Gulf. Its inhabitants were Aryans, whose immigration into the country called after their name was hardly earlier than the period of the fall of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrian inscriptions know nothing of them. Under leaders termed Akhaemenians (from Hakhdmanish, "the friendly")
the tribe of the Persians pushed its way into the old kingdom of Anzan, or Southern Elam, which had been destroyed and desolated by the armies of Assur-bani-pal, and subsequently left a prey to the first invader by the decay of the Assyrian power. The tribe was but one out of many which had long been steadily advancing westward from the regions of the Hindu Kush. The first great wave of Aryan emigration, which had resulted in the establishment of the European nations, had been followed by another wave which first carried the Hindus into the Punjab, and then the Iranian populations into the vast districts of Baktria and Ariana. Mountains and deserts checked for a time their
further progress, but at length a number of tribes, each under its own chiefs, crept along the southern shores of the Caspian or the northern coast of the Persian Gulf. These tribes were known in later history as the Aryan Medes and Persians. The Medes are first mentioned on the Assyrian monuments by Shalmaneser II. (B.C. 840) under the double name of Amadai and Matai, and placed in Matien^. Between them and the Zimri of
Kurdistan intervened the people of Par'suas, with their twenty-seven kings, who occupied the south-westcni shore of Lake Urumiyeh. But it is doubtful whether these Matai were really the Aryan Medes and not rather "Protomedes," allied in race and language to the Kossaeans and Elamites, and more distantly to the Accadians of primaeval Babylonia. At any rate the name seems derived from the Accadian macUi, "country," a title appropriately given to the country where the " mountain of the world " was situated, and which was held to be the cradle of the Accadian race ; while the name of Khanatsiruka, who ruled over the Matai in b.c. 820, certainly has not an Aryan sound.



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 43^
Most of the Median districts on the southern and south-western shores of the Caspian enumerated by Tiglath-Pileser II. have non-Aryan names, and the Median chieftains with such Aryan names as Phames, Ariya, and Vastakku, who are mentioned by Sargon (in B.C. 713), belonged to the extreme east. In fact the district of Partakanu, which represents the Median Paretakeni of Herodotos, is recorded last in
Sargon's list ; and Esar-haddon, who divides it into the two provinces
of Partakka and Partukka, describes it as the furthest place east in the known world. Tlie other Median tribes of Herodotos were still unknown to the Assjrian kings. With the fall of the Assyrian empire, however, came a change.
The scattered tribes of prae-Aryan Media were united under a single monarchy by Kastarit or KyaxarSs. Hitherto they had been divided into a multitude of small states, each governed independently by its
own chief, or " city lord," as he is termed by Esar-haddon. Kyaxares, according to Herodotos, was the descendant of Deiok^, the builder of Ekbatana, a name which appears as Daiukku in the Assyrian records. One Daiukku, a chief of the Minni (on the western shore of Lake Urumiyeh) under their king UUusun, was transported to Hamath by Sargon in 715 B.C., and two or three years later the Assyrian monarch made an expedition to the three adjoining districts of Ellibi, Karalla,
and Bit-Daiukku, " the house of Deiokes." Ellibi lay on the eastern
frontier of Kurdistan, and included the land of Aranzi—a name preserved in the Orontes mountains of classical geography, the Urvanda
of the old Persians — where Ekbatana was afterwards founded. Karalla intervened between the northern boundary of Ellibi and the
south-eastern shores of Lake Urumiyeh. It is just possible that the
Median kings of Ktesias, Astibaras, and Artaios, may represent (Rita or) Dalta, who was placed on the throne of Ellibi by Sargon in B.C.
709, and his son, Ispabara, who came into conflict with Sennacherib. However this may be, Kastarit was king of that part only of Media in which the city of Caru-kassi was situated, his ally Mamiti-arsu
having the general title " city lord of the Medes." Along with the
Minni, the people of 'Saparda or Sepharad—a small district on the east
of Ellibi—and the Kimmerians, the two allies attacked and overthrew the Assyrian power. Kastarit now seems to have turned against his friends, and to have gradually extended his sway over the whole re'^ion vaguely known as Armenia and Western Media. Peace was established between him and Alyatt6s of Lydia in B.c. 585 through the kindly offices of his ally Nebuchadrezzar, and the Halys made



438 APPENDIX V.
the boundary of the Median and Lydian empires. Under the shadow of Mount Urvanda or Elwend, Aganatanu or Ekbatana (now Hamadan) was founded in imitation of the new Babylon Nebuchadrezzar had built
Kyaxares was succeeded by his son Istuvegu, the Astyages of the Greek writers, whom later Persian legend confounded with the tyrant Zohak or Azhi-dahaka, "the biting snake" of night and darkness,
celebrated in ancient Aryan mythology. The classical historians connected him by marriage with his conqueror Kyros, but the recent
discovery of contemporaneous records has proved their accounts to be so largely mixed with fable that it becomes unsafe to accept any statement not supported by monumental authority. Kyros was the son of Kambyses, the son of Kyros, the son of Teispes, who had been the first to establish the Persian rule in Anzan or Western Elam,
which extended from the district of Susa in the north to the Persian
Gulf in the south.^ Dareios, the son of Hystaspes, who traces his descent through Arsames and Ariaramnes to Teispes, the son of Akhaemenes, probably refers to the same Teispes, and would there
fore be justified in his claim to be of the royal race. It is even possible that while Kyros I. and Kambyses I. were ruling in Anzan, Ariaramnes and Arsames governed the more unmixed Aryan part of the population in Persis. At any rate Dareios declares that eight of
his race had been kings before him ; and while his own ancestors all bear thoroughly Aryan names, the names Kyros and Kambyses seem to be of Elamite derivation. Strabo,^ indeed, says that Kyros was originally called Agradates, and took the name of Kurus or Kuras from
the river that flows past Pasargadse; while Nikolaus Damascenus, doubt
less quoting Kt^sias, made him the son of the peasant Atradates, the Mitradates of Herodotos, whom he calls an Amardian. The Amardians, it must be remembered, were an Elamite tribe bordering upon the Persians and intervening between them and the Susians, whose dialects closely resembled their own. They seem to be the Khapirti or Apirti of the inscriptions, who inhabited the plain of Mai-Amir. It was in B.C. 549 that AstyagSs was overthrown. On his march against Kyros his own soldiers, drawn probably from his Aryan

subjects, revolted against him and gave him into the hands of his enemy. " The land of Ekbatana and the royal city " were ravaged and plundered by the conqueror ; the Aryan Medes at once acknowledged the supremacy of Kyros, and the empire of Kyaxar§s was destroyed. Some time, however, was still needed to complete the conquest ; the older Medic population still held out in the more distant regions of the empire, and probably received encouragement and promises of help from Babylonia. In B.C. 546, however, Kyros marched from Arbela, crossed the Tigris, and destroyed the last relics of Median independence. It was on this occasion that he must have captured Larissa or Resen and Mespila or Muspilu, near the site of Nineveh, whose ruins were seen by Xenophon [Anah. iii. 4). The daughter of AstyagSs had taken refuge in Mespila, which was strongly fortified. The following
year saw the opening of the campaign against Babylonia. But the Babylonian army, encamped near Sippara, formed a barrier which the Persians were unable to overcome ; and trusting, therefore, to under
mine the power of Nabonidos by secret intrigues with his subjects, Kyros proceeded against Kroesos. A single campaign suflBced to capture Sardes and its monarch, and to add Asia Minor to the Persian dominions. The Persian conqueror was now free to attack Babylonia. Here his intrigues were already bearing fruit. The Jewish exiles were anxiously expecting him* to redeem them from captivity, and the tribes on the sea coast were ready to welcome a new master. In B.C. 538 the blow was struck. The Persian army entered Babylonia from the south. The army of Nabonidos was defeated at Rata in June ; on the 1 4th of that month Sippara opened its gates, and two days later Gobryas, the Persian general, marched into Babylon itself
"without battle and fighting." The elaborate fortifications of the queen-mother had been in vain ; traitors had worked on the side of the invader. In October Kyros himself entered his new capital in
triumph ; priests and scribes alike strove to do him honour, and to account him as one of their native kings. The fall of Nabonidos was
attributed to his neglect of the gods, and the politic Kyros did his best to encourage the illusion by professing, along with his son Kam
byses, to be a zealous worshipper of the Babylonian deities. Their images were restored to their shrines with great state, the Persian
monarch and his heir-apparent taking part in the solemn processions,
and the new sovereign styled himself, like his predecessors, "the worshipper" and "servant" of Bel-Merodach and Nebo. It is pro
bable that the ruler of Western Elam had always been a polytheist.



440 APPENDIX V.
Zoroastrian monotheism was first made the state-religiou by Darius
Hystaspis, who represented a more genuinely Aryan stock than the
collateral family of Kyros. The excesses of Kambyses in Egypt were
dictated not by religious fanaticism, but by political suspicion, as is proved by the inscriptions in which he avows his adherence to the old Egyptian creed. The stel^ which commemorates the death of the Apis bull, said by Herodotos to have been slain by Kambysfis, shows that, on the contrary, it had died a natural death, had been buried under his auspices, and had monumental authority for accounting him one of its worshippers.
The fall of Babylon brought with it the submission of the tributary
kings, including those of Phoenicia. If we may listen to Greek legend,
Kyros fell in battle with the wild Skythian tribes of the north-east. But the same myths that grew up around his birth and early history seem also to have gathered round his death. Just as Persian ballads
fastened upon him the old story of the solar hero who is exposed to death in infancy, and after being saved by miracle, and brought up
in obscurity, is finally discovered and restored to his high estate, so
too the old lesson of the punishment of human pride and greatness was taught by the legend of his death. The woman-warrior Tomyris
was made to quell the great conqueror, and to throw his head into the bowl of human blood where he might drink his fill Before his death Kyros had made his son Kambyses king of Babylon, reserving for himself the supreme title, "king of the world." His death occurred in B.c. 529, at least two years afterwards. The
first act of Kambyses, as sole ruler, was to murder his brother Bardes, the Smerdis of Herodotos, to whom his father had bequeathed a portion of the empire. Then followed the invasion and conquest of Egypt, and the distant expeditions against Ethiopia and the Oasis of Ammon. The long absence of the monarch and the army soon produced its inevitable consequences. The loosely-cemented empire
began to fall to pieces. The revolt was headed by the Medic tribe of Magians. The Magian Gomates personated the murdered Bardes, and seized the throne. He represented the non-Aryan portion of the
population, which viewed with jealousy the increasing influence of the Aryan element. KambysSs, like Kyros, it is true, had not been a Zoroastrian, and the personator of his brother could thus overthrow the altare and temples of Zoroastrianism without imperilling his imposture ; but he had countenanced and probably favoured it During his absence the government had been in the hands of the great Aryan



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 441
families, who traced their descent from the royal clan of Akhajmenfis,
and tiiese families were all Zoroastrian. Hence in the Magian usurpation we see at once a political and a religious revolt It was directed against Aryan supremacy and the worship of Ormazd, the
supreme deity of the Zoroastrian creed, and it was at the same time
a signal for the different nationalities which composed the empire of
Kyros to recover their independence. Before it could be crushed KambysSs committed suicide, after reigning eleven years as king of Babylon, and about eight years as sole monarch. The reign of Gomates did not last a year. Dareios the son of HystaspSs, with six other Persian nobles, overthrew the usurper and slew him in Nisaea in Media, where he had taken refuge among his clansmen (B.C. 621). Zoroastrianism was made the religion of the empire ; the temples of Ormazd, which Gomates had destroyed, were restored ; and the Aryan families of Persia and Media were brought back from exile. If we may trust Dr. Oppert's rendering of a passage
in the " Protomedic " transcript of the great Behistun Inscription,
where Dareios records the deeds and successes of his life, the Avesta or sacred book of Zoroastrianism, along with its commentary, was republished and promulgated throughout the empire. The flight of Gomates was the signal for the massacre of all his followers and tribesmen who were left in Persia. The Magophonia long continued to be a popular festival in Persia, when it was unsafe for a Magian to venture out of doors. But the spirit of revolt was by no means extinguished. Immediately after the death of the pseudoBardes, Susiana and Babylonia alike shook off" the Persian yoke.
Under the leadership of Assina the Susians claimed again the freedom which Teispes had taken from them, and the extinction of the family of Kyros seemed a favourable opportunity for recovering it. Babylon revolted under Nidintabel, who called himself " Nebuchadrezzar the son of Nabonidos," the last Babylonian king. But the Susian rebellion was soon put down. Babylon took longer to reduce. After defeating
Nidintabel at Zazana, Dareios laid siege to the city. It was taken June B.C. 519 after a blockade of nearly two years, the Persians penetrating into the city during a festival by marching along the dry channel of the Euphrates. By this time, however, the non-Aryan population of Media was in revolt under Phraortes, who called himself
Sattarritta or Kyaxar6s, the descendant of Vakistarra. Battle after
battle was fought in Armenia by the Persian generals ; until at last Phraortes was captured in Ilhagae and impaled. It was the last

struggle for independence ; from this time forward the older population acknowledged the supremacy of the Aryan intruders, and became merged in the latter. Henceforth by Medians are meant the Aryan kindred of the Persians themselves. It cost Dareios some trouble yet to reconquer the empire of Kyros,
A second revolt, promptly suppressed, took place among the Susians, and a second one also among the Babylonians. This time it was an Armenian who professed to be Nebuchadrezzar the son of Nabonidos, but his career was soon closed by the capture of Babylon in B.c. 613.
The Sagartians arose in unsuccessful insurrection under a leader who claimed to be a descendant of the Median Vakistarra, a proof that the Median empire had once included Sagartia. As the Parthians and Hyrkanians had followed Phraortes, we may perhaps infer that Parthia and Hyrkania also had formed part of the old Median monarchy. A second pseudo-Bardes also had to be crushed ; he was a native of Tarava, the modern Tarun in Luristan, but, though born in Aryan
territory, was followed not by Persians, but by Susianians. He, too,
was defeated and slain in Arachosia. Margiana, moreover, had risen in revolt ; but as unsuccessfully as the other provinces of the empire. Dareios was at last free to organise and settle what he had won back
with so much difficulty and labour.
In the work of organisation Dareios proved himself a master. The empire was made a homogeneous whole, with its centre at Susa or
Shushan. For the first time in history centralisation becomes a
political fact. The king was the source of all authority and all
dignities ; every subject was equal before the throne, which was the
fountain of law. It is true that a council, consisting of the seven
leading families and a hereditary sub-nobility, sat without the will of
the king ; but this relic of a period when Persia had not yet become an empire had neither power nor influence against the bureaucracy which managed the government, and even the great king himself The government of Persia became what the government of Turkey has been
of late years—a highly centralised bureaucracy, the members of which
owed their offices to an irresponsible despot. The centralisation of Persia stands in marked contrast to the decentralisation of Greece, as well as of the Aryan Medes themselves before the rise of the Median monarchy. The empire was divided into at least twenty satrapies,^ communication being kept up between them by roads and posts which
' Dareios mentions twenty -three at Behistun, twenty -nine on his tomb at Naksh-i-Rustdm.



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 443
all met in Susa. Each satrap was responsible for a fixed tribute
of from 170 to 1000 Euboic silver talents (£42,000 to £250,000), out of which the civil and military officers, the army, and the satrap him
self, were paid. It was of course the interest of the crown to prevent the provinces from being exhausted by additional taxation, but the satrap generally managed to squeeze a good deal more than the fixed tribute out of his subjects. The satraps were like small kings ; indeed
their official residences were called palaces, and in some cases, as for
example in Kilikia, the native princes were allowed to hold rule. The danger to the Government caused by the power of the satrap and his distance from the central authority was diminished in several Avays.
Royal scribes or secretaries were employed to send up reports of the
satraps and their actions to the king, and from time to time an officer
came down from the court with an armed force to inspect a province. The satraps themselves were generally connected with the king by birth or marriage, and in Persia proper royal judges went on circuit
at least once a year. According to Xenophon the control of the troops was further handed over to a separate commander, and it would seem that important fortresses like Sardes were also entrusted to an independent officer. Owing, however, to the weakness occasioned
by this division of authority, the civil and military powers were
united in the satrapies which 'bordered on dangerous enemies, such as
the Greeks, and it was accordingly in these frontier satrapies that
revolts like that of the younger Kyros broke out. The districts of which a satrapy was composed were not always contiguous. The imperial exchequer received no less than 7740 talents or £2,964,000 a year from nineteen of the provinces, which paid in silver, and of which Babylonia contributed the most, and 4680 Euboic talents or £1,290,000 from the twentieth or Indian province, which paid in gold.
The provinces had further to furnish tribute in kind, grain, sheep, and
the like, and rates were levied in many places for the use of water and of the royal demesnes, while the taxes derived from such things as
fisheries were farmed by the State. The gold and silver darics coined from the specie collected at Susa, and impressed with a rude represent
ation of an archer, were remarkably pure, containing respectively 124 and 224 to 230 grains of pure metal. While this work of organisation was being completed the empire was at peace. Then came a war against Iskunka the Sakian chief, succeeded by a campaign in the East. The Indus was first explored by a naval expedition under Skylax, a Karian Greek ; this was followed



444 APPENDIX V.
by the conquest of the Punjab. Dareios was now free to secure liis north-western frontier. The Skythian coast on the Black Sea was explored as the Indus had been, the Bosporus was bridged by Mandrokles the Samian, and the steppes of Southern Russia were swept by the Persian army. The impression left on the Skythian mind was never wiped out ; the empire was henceforward safe on that side. Meanwhile Megabazos with another army had reduced Thrake, and made Makedonia a tributary kingdom. Shortly afterwards, in B.C. 501, came the Ionic revolt. Sardes was burnt by the Athenians, and Dareios, bent on vengeance, no
longer delayed to listen to the exile Hippias, and to demand the sub
mission of Athens and the restoration of its tyrant. Mardonios was
sent against the offending city with a large army. But his fleet was
wrecked off Mount Athos, and the land-force surprised by the wild
Thrakian tribe of Briges. Two years later (B.C. 490) the Persian
army under Datis was again hurled against Attika ; but Athenian valour at Marathon drove back a power hitherto held invincible, and
saved Greece. For three years Asia was now astir with preparations for crushing the handful of citizens that had dared to resist the mighty Persian empire. Fortunately for Athens, Egypt revolted at the
moment when the preparations were completed (B.C. 487), and diverted the blow which would have fallen upon her. Before the revolt could be suppressed Dareios died in the sixty-third year of his age and the
thirty-sixth of his reign (B.C. 486).
His son and successor Xerxes, born in the purple, was a different
man from his father. Weak, vain, and luxurious, it need not suqirise us that the huge and unwieldy host he led against Hellas returned shattered and discomfited, and that after the defeat of Mardonios with
his picked Persian and Median troops at Plataea, the war that Persia
carried into Europe should have recoiled back into Asia. The islands of the ^gean, the Greek colonies of Asia Minor, the wild coasts of Thrak6, the command of the Hellespont, were one by one wrested from the great king by Athenian skill and enterprise. The sole result of the attempt to enslave Greece was to found the
Athenian empire, and to make Athens the intellectual and artistic
leader of the world then and thereafter. Before the campaign against Greece had been entered upon, Xerx6s had punished the Babylonians for their murder of the satrap Zopyros by destroying the temple of
Bel and the other shrines of the ancient gods.
Xerxfis was murdered by two of his courtiers in B.C. 466, at the



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 445
instigation, it was believed, of Amestris, the only wife he had ever married. His third son, Artaxerxes I. Longimanus, had to win his way to the throne by crashing the Baktrians under his brother IlystaspSs, and murdering another brother. In B.C. 455 an Egyptian
revolt was put down after lasting for five years, and in B.C. 449 a
treaty of peace, known as that of Kallias, was made between Persia
and Athens,—Athens agreeing to relinquish Kypros, and Persia renouncing her claims to supremacy over the Greek cities of Asia Minor. Not long afterwards Megabyzos, the satrap of Syria, revolted, and
extorted terms of peace from his suzerain, the first open sign of the inner decay of the empire.
Artaxerxes, who, like his father, had but one legitimate wife, Daraaspia, was succeeded by his son Xerxes II. (B.C. 425), who was
assassinated at a banquet forty-five days after by his illegitimate brother, Sekydianos or Sogdianos. Sogdianos was murdered in turn by Okhos, another bastard son of Artaxerxes, about six months later.
Okhos took the name of Dareios, and is known to history as Dareios II. Nothos. He had married his aunt Parysatis, daughter of Xerxes, and his reign of nineteen years was one long series of revolts, most of which were crushed mercilessly. The first was headed by his brother Arsit^s ; then came those of Pissuthnes, the Lydian satrap, of Media, and of Egypt. The loss of Egypt, however, was compensated by the restoration of Persian authority over the Greeks of Asia Minor in
consequence of the destruction of the Athenian power at Syrakuse. Dareios 11. was followed by his son, Artaxerxes II. Mnemon (rc.
405), in spite of the efforts of his wife Parysatis to substitute for the
latter her younger and abler son, Kyros. Four years later Kyros left his satrapy in Asia Minor, and marched against his brother with about 13,000 Greek mercenaries and 100,000 native troops. The battle of Cunaxa ended his life and his claim to the throne, and the retreat of the Greeks under Xenoph6n became one of the great feats of history. But the authority of the Persian king was gone in the West. Mysia, Pisidia, and Paphlagonia were all practically independent; Sparta protected the Greek colonies, and her forces under Derkyllidas and Agesilaos made themselves masters of Western Asia (B.C. 399-395), and might have anticipated Alexander had not Persian gold sowed dissension at home. A league was formed between Per^iia, Athens, and other Greek states ; the Long Walls were rebuilt at Athens with
Persian money, and Sparta was forced to sigti the disgraceful peace of



446 APPENDIX V.
Antalkidas (B.C. 387), by which all Asia was restored to the great king. In B.C. 379 Evagoras of Salamis, who, with Egyptian and Athenian help, had made Kypros and Ealikia independent and conquered Tyre, was finally crushed. But the decay of the empire could not be checked. The satraps of Phrygia and Kappadokia shook oflf their allegiance, and in B.C. 362 a general but unsuccessful revolt took place in Asia Minor and Syria. Three years later Artaxerxes died at the age of ninety-four, according to the doubtful statement of Plutarch. His son and successor, Okhos, had already caused the deaths
of three of his brothers, and his first act on mounting the throne was
to destroy, as far as he could, the other princes of the royal family. His attempt to recover Egypt failed, and Phoenicia and Kypros declared themselves free. Idrieus, vassal king of Karia, however, reduced Kypros. Sidon, the head of the Phoenician revolt, was
destroyed, and Egypt reconquered by the Persian general, the eunuch Bag6as, and the able Greek admiral Mentdr, the Rhodian. For six years there was peace, thanks to Bagdas, who had become Vizier, and Ment6r, who was entrusted with the protection of the sea-board. But in B.C. 338 Okhos was poisoned by his Vizier, who raised his son Ars^s to the throne after murdering all his brothers. Two years afterwards Arses also and his children were assassinated, and Bag6as now placed the crown on the head of a personal friend, Kodomannos, the son of Arsanes. Kodomannos, who took the name of Dareios III.,
was not of the royal family, according to Strabo (xv. 3, 24), though this is contradicted by Dioddros (xvii. 5, 5). It was not long before he was called upon to contest his empire with Alexander of Makedon. In the spring of B.C. 334 Alexander crossed the Hellespont with a force of over 30,000 foot, and between four and five thousand horse. In May the battle of the Graneikos placed Asia Minor at his feet. Memnon, the brother of the Rhodian Ment6r, the only Persian general equal to the task of checking the Makedonian conqueror, died early in the following year, and Alexander was now free to advance into the
heart of Persia. Dareios and his army were well nigh annihilated in the Pass of Issos on the Bay of Antioch (in November); his wife, mother, and baggage fell into the hands of the enemy ; Tyre and Gaza were besieged and captured; Egypt was occupied by the Greeks; and at the Oasis of Ammon Alexander was hailed as the son of Zeus. At length, in B.C. 331, the decisive moment came. A new army had
been collected by the Persian king from his eastern dominions, and was strongly posted about thirty miles from the site of Nineveh



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 447
awaiting the attack of the Makedonians. The battle was fought in October at Gaugamela, twenty miles distant from Arbela, and ended
with the total rout of the Persian host, the flight of Dareios, and the fall of his empire. Alexander entered Babylon in triumph, assumed
imperial pomp at Susa, where the spoils carried from Greece by Xerx6s were discovered and sent back, and, if we may believe the current story, fired the royal palace of Persepolis in a fit of drunken insanity. Dareios was then pursued, first to Ekbatana, next to Rhagae and Baktria, where the hapless monarch was seized and finally
murdered by the satrap Bessos. The reduction of the rest of the Persian empire by Alexander quickly followed.
Religion and Mythology. —The religion of Persia was Zoroastrianism. But the nature and teaching of Zoroastrianism varied at different times
and in different localities. The inscriptions make it plain that the
Zoroastrianism of Dareios and his successors was widely different
from that of later times. The early populations of Media and Elam, dispossessed or overlaid by the Aryan invaders, had the same
shamanistic form of religion as the Accadians of primitive Chaldea. They were grossly polytheistic, and the polytheism of Elam had in
later days been largely affected by the religious beliefs and practices of Semitic Babylonia, mor^ especially by the worship of Nana or Istar. On the other hand, the Iranian emigrants had monotheistic tendencies. The supreme god Ahura-mazda, '* the lord who gives knowledge," tended to absorb all the other deities of the original Aryan creed. The gods of Vedic nature-worship became his attributes and creatures. But this nature-worship had included evil powers as
well as beneficent powers, night as well as darkness, pain as well as
pleasure, the serpent as well as the sun-god who slays him. Gradually the conflict between these opposites assumed a moral form in the minds of the Iranian wanderers ; the struggle between night and day, between the storm and the blue sky, of which the Vedic poets sang, was transformed into a struggle between good and evil. In place of the careless nature-worshipper of the Panjab, a race of stern and earnest Puritans grew up among the deserts and rugged mountains of Ariana. M. Darmesteter has tried to show that the transformation and development were natural. But the attempt is unsuccessful. Though there is much in Zoroastrianism (or Mazdeism) that is clearly a natural
development out of the elements we find in Vedic religion. —though the fundamental ideas upon which Mazdeism rests have grown out of the
conceptions common to all the primitive Aryans alike, —it is neverthe



448 APPENDIX V.
less impossible to explain the individual character that has been stamped upon it without assuming the existence of an individual
founder. We must accept the historical reality of Zoroaster or Spitama Zarathustra. Zoroastrianism implies a prophet as much as Mohammedanism. According to the usual opinion, this prophet lived and taught in
Baktriana. Zend, the language of the Avesta, the sacred book of Mazdeism, differs dialectically from the Old Persian spoken in Persia
Proper by Dareios and his subjects, and is ordinarily believed to have been the language of Baktriana. M. Darmesteter, however, supposes the original home of Mazdeism to have been Atropaten^ ; but as he further supposes that Mazdeism did not take its start here till the sixth century B.C., his views do not clash with the received theory which makes Baktriana the first seat of Zoroastrianism and of the
language of its sacred books. Another theory has been started by M. de Harlez.^ He makes Rhagse (now Kaleh Erij) and Mouru or Meru the birthplace of the new creed in the seventh century B.C. But Rhaga?, again, under the shadow of Mount Demavend, only marks a stage in the western progress of the Iranian tribes ; and the same Parsi legend which relates that the prophet was born in Rai or Rhagse makes him
teach his religion in Baktria at the court of King Vistasp. A more important question, however, remains behind. The two scholars just mentioned not only think that Zend was the language of Aryan Media rather than of Baktria, but they also hold that Mazdeism itself, as embodied in the Avesta, was taught and promulgated by the Magi. In the revolt of the pseudo-Bardes M. Darmesteter sees not an uprising of the old non-Aryan faith, but an attempt to impose the
peculiar tenets of the priestly tribe of Magians upon the rest of the people. The chief arguments in favour of this hypothesis are sought
in the classical writers. Strabo (xv. 14) describes the Magi as a
sacerdotal caste spread over the land, and Herodotos (i. 140) states that it was the Magi who practised the peculiarly Mazdean duty of killing noxious animals, and required the corpse to be devoured by
birds, not buried in the ground. But in Strabo's time the old distinctions between the Aryan and the non-Aryan portions of the population had been obliterated, and the Greeks had come to apply the term
Magian indiscriminately to the various priests and sorcerers of the East
;
while, as is shown in the note upon the passage, the statement of
^ See his exhaustive review of the subject in his Introduction d l'£iude de I'Avesta, 1882.



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 449
Herodotos admits of another interpretation, and is corrected by his own descriptions of the Magi elsewhere as a Median tribe, neither more nor
less sacerdotal than the other five tribes mentioned along with them. Against these doubtful quotations we have the express testimony of Dareios himself, engraved on the rock of Behistun, where he tells us that the Magian usurpation had destroyed the temples of his gods and the sacred hymns of the Zoroastrian faith.^ According to Dr. Oppert the Behistun Inscription further informs us that the Avesta had existed before the days of the Magian revolt, and was restored by Dareios after the revolt was suppressed. He would thus render a clause at the end of the inscription found only in the " Protomedic " transcript : "By the favour of Ormazd I have made elsewhere a collection of texts in the Aryan language, which formerly did not exist. And I have made a text of the law and a commentary on the law, and the prayer and the translations. And this was
written, and I promulgated it ; then I restored the ancient book in all countries, and the people followed it." ^ The Persian equivalents of " the law " and " the prayer " are dbastd and zandi, " Avesta " and " Zend." Whatever doubt may hang over the renderings of particular words, the general sense of this translation may be accepted ; Dareios claims to have restored the ancient writings that had been destroyed or injured by the Magian revolt. It is highly probable that both
Kyros and his son, as well as their predecessors, the kings of Anzan,
had been almost equally responsible for the loss or neglect of the
^ Col. i. Par. 14. Persian text: Ayadand tyd GauDidta hya Magvsh viyaka,adam niyatrdrayam kdrahydabdcharish gaithdmchd maniyamchd, "The temples which Gomates the Magian had destroyed, I rebuilt.

2 The following is the literal rendering of the passage, the meaning of all the words of which is certain except the three wiitten in italics : " By the grace of Ormazd, I have made the writings for others in the Aryan language, which was not done before ; and the text (?) of the law and the knowledge of the law and the collection (?) and the ...

450 APPENDIX V.
sacred books, and the fact that the people needed to be " taught " the law implies that among the Persians themselves a knowledge of the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism had been half forgotten. But the Avesta had not yet become a technical term. Abastd is rendered simply "law" and "laws" in the Elamite and Babylonian versions ; it was
the pious care of Dareios which first gave it its fixed and restricted sense. His words seem to show that the Zend text was translated into the Old Persian of his western provinces. We must not suppose, however, that the Avesta was completed at once, or that the beliefs and customs of the Sassanian age were familiar to the Persians in the age of the Akhaemenians. Dareios speaks of other gods by the side of Ormazd ; Ormazd is supreme among them ; he has created them, like all things else ; but nevertheless other gods
also exist. Temples, too, are erected to him and them, contraiy to the later teaching of Mazdeism. The dead were buried, sometimes
alive, and there is no trace of those elaborate regulations in regard to purity which occupy so large a part of the Avesta, and must have been devised, as M. Br6al has shown, at a time when Mazdeism had
ceased to be the religion of the state. In fact, the sacred literature of
Zoroastrianism was a slow and gradual growth, like the sacred literatures
of most other religions. The five GMhas or " hymns," written in an older dialect than the
rest of the Avesta, form the earliest portion of this literature They
are embodied in the Yasna, which, like the Visperad, is a collection of litanies for the sacrifice. Together with the Vendidad, a compilation of religious laws and mythical tales, the Yasna and Visperad make up the Avesta properly so called. By the side of this stands the Khorda Avesta or " Small Avesta," consisting of short prayers, and divided
into the five G^h, the thirty formulae of the Sirozah, the three Afrigiin,
and the six Nyayish. To these are generally added the Yashts or hymns of praise, and a number of fragments, of which the most important is the Hadhokht Nosk. The sacredness of the Avesta is to
some extent reflected on certain literature written in Pahlavi or mediaeval Persian towards the end of the Sassanian period, among which may be named the Bundehesh, an exposition of Mazdean cosmogony and mythology. This sacred literature, however, is but a
fragment of what once existed ; according to Parei tradition, the Vendidad is the only survivor of the twenty-one Nosks or books which formed the primitive Avesta revealed by Ormazd to Zoroaster,
the eighteen Yashts were originally thirty in number, and the



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 451
Biindehesh has many references which are not found in existing Zend texts. Hermippos ^ analysed 2,000,000 lines in the books of Zoroaster, and Pausanias heard Magian priests singing hymns from a book.'^ A tradition which may be traced back to the Sassanian age asserts that the present Avesta consists of the fragments put together by the
priests, partly from memory, after the destruction of the sacred books by Alexander the Great, and the Mohammedan conquest brought with it further injury and loss.
Dr. Oppert thinks that a reference to Angro-Mainyu-s, the evil
spirit, is found in an inscription of Dareios. However this may be,
it is pretty clear that the distinctive dualism of Zoroastrian doctrine was already fully developed in Akhaemenian times. The world was divided into the mutually-hostile kingdoms of good and evil, though
Ormazd (Ahuramazda) had originally created all things, and evil would therefore be again swallowed upin the kingdom of good. On the side of Ormazd and the faithful follower of his prophet stand the Ahuras or
"living" spirits, called "gods" by Dareios, and subsequently converted into the Yazatas (Izeds) or angels, and the seven AmeshaSpentas (Amshashpands), " the undying and well-doing ones." These, originally identical with the Adityas of Hindu mythology, became the deified abstractions, Vohu-mand (" good thought "), Asha Vahishta (" excellent holiness "), Khshathra vaviya (" perfect sovereignty "), Spenta Armaiti ("divine piety "), Haurvatat (" health "), and Ameret&t (" immortality "). But Armaiti had once been the goddess of earth, like Vayu, the wind-god, who appears in the Gathas, Varena "the sky," and Mithra "the sun." From the first Varena had been identified with Ormazd, or rather Varena was the supreme being specially invoked as Ahura-mazda, while Mithra became in time his material symbol. Under the Akhaemenian dynasty, however, the complete absorption of Mithra into Ormazd had not yet been effected ; and though Dareios shows no taint of Mithra worship, his descendant Artaxerxes Mnem6n, corrupted by Babylonian superstition, adopted the popular cult, and not only invoked the sun-god Mithra, but even set up images to Anahit or Tanata, the Babylonian Nana, at Susa, at Persepolis, at Ekbatana, at Babylon, at Damascus, at Sanies, and at Baktra. The Mithraic worship of later days, which symbolised the
passage of the sun into Taurus by the figure of a bull slain by a man,
was the last survival of a faith that had once penetrated deeply into
the minds of the people.

452 APPENDIX V.
Angro-Mainyus (Ahriman), "the dark spirit," the opponent of Ormazd, was primitively the darkness of night and storm. The
Devas, or "gods," who had assisted liim in the old mythological combat between night and day, became the demons of Mazdeism, and some of the gods of light also were in time included among them. The archangels and angels of good were matched by those of evil. Ako-man6 {" bad thought") opposes Vohu-mand (" good thought"), and with his companions, Sauru, the arrow of death, Indra, once the rain
god of India, Naunhaithya (the Vedic Dioskuri), Tauru and Zairi,
sickness and decay, form the council of the prince of darkness. What
ever Ormazd creates, Ahriman destroys. At the head of the army of
Ormazd is the priest-god Sraosha (Serosh), who first offered sacrifice to Ahura and sang the holy hymns. Thrice each day and night he
descends to smite Angro-Mainyus and his crew,— the Kahvaredhas and Kahvaredhis, the Kayadhas and KayJidhis, the Zandas and Yatiis, Aeshma ("the raving"), the leader of the Drvants, Dmkhs, "destruc
tion," Daivis, "deceit," and Drivis, "poverty." Sraosha dwelt in a palace of a thousand pillars, ornamented without by the stars, lit within by its own light, and reared on the peak of Elburz or Demavend, to which the Olympos of Accadian and Protomedic mythology had been transferred. The legend had filtered into Mazdeism through a " Protomedic " channel. The weapons with which the worshipper of Ormazd had to fight
against his spiritual foes were prayer, sacrifice, purity, the sacrament
of the Haoma, and various ceremonies, among which may be particularised the use of the khrafsthraghna or instrument for destroying
noxious animals,— the creation of Ahriman, —and the baresma (barsom) or divining rod, which had played a large part in Accadian religion, and must have been borrowed from the " Protomedic " part of the
population. Sacrifice, which consisted partly of offerings, partly of
prayers, aided the gods as well as men. The costliest victim was the
horse, human sacrifices being ascribed to the Persians by Greek writers
erroneously. The flesh of the victim was eaten by the priest and the worshippers ; the *' soul " of it only was enjoyed by Ormazd. The
Haoma was the Soma of the Indians, an intoxicating plant which
symbolised the powers of vegetable life, and the juice of which was
drunk by the faithful for the benefit of themselves and the gods. Answering to the yellow haoma of earth is the white haoma of heaven, which will make men immortal on the day of resurrection. For the
Zoroastrians believed in the immortality of the soul, and at least as



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 453
early as the time of Theopompos * in a resurrection of the body. It was from them that Mohammed borrowed the notion of the narrow bridge {chinvat perdu) which the soul of the good passed safely by the
help of Sraosha, while the wicked fell from it into the bottomless pit of Angro-Mainyus. Fire was from the first the sacred element ; it was the material manifestation of Ormazd, and nothing was allowed
to pollute it At one time, no doubt, fire itself was worshipped, like
the primitive Aryan hearth on which it had originally blazed, and Atar, the fire-god, held high rank among the Zoroastrians ; but eventually it became the medium through which the worshipper approached his deity. Earth and water were also reverenced, and since a corpse would have defiled these sacred elements, it was left to be devoured
by the beasts and birds. The dog was a sacred animal, perhaps
because of his scavenger-like habits ; but it is now difficult to explain the principles upon which certain animals were handed over to Ormazd
and certain others to Ahriman. The existence of the world was held to be limited. After 13,000 years it was to end in winter or storm, to be followed by an eternal
spring, when the earth would be repeopled by the risen bodies of the
righteous. It is possible that this doctrine was taught as early as the
time of Dareios. But a later 'date must be assigned to the further
conception of the final victory of good and absorption of evil into it. This conception led to the pure monotheism which believed that above and beyond both Ormazd and Ahriman there was one abiding
principle, called by various sects Space or Infinite Light or Fate or Zrvan akarana, " boundless time." The early date, however, at which the belief grew up may be judged from the fact that Eudemos, the pupil of Aristotle, already makes time and space the first principles of
the Magi.^ But it is unknown to the greater part of the Avesta, from which we may infer the age of the latter. This is not the only
instance in which we can assign a relative date to different portions of the sacred book. When the tenth Fargard or chapter of the Vendidad was written, and the nineteenth Yasht composed, the opposition between the six archangels and the six arch-fiends, mentioned in the Bundehesh and already found in Plutarch, was unknown, and, as M. Darmesteter says, " the stars were not yet members of the Ormazdean army wlien the bulk of the eighth Yasht was compiled." But the old opposition between the dthrava or Mazdean priest and the

454 APPENDIX V.
magus or " Protomedic " sorcerer was already passing away ; under the
unifying influences of the Persian empire magian and priest became inextricably confounded ; the magian adopted the outlines of the
Zoroastrian faith, and in later days hardened them into a system of sacerdotal laws and lifeless ceremonies ; while the priest took over the
beliefs of the older population, modifying and altering them in the
process. Thus, as M. Lenormant has shown, the spirits of the shamanistic cult of Accad and Elam were changed into the fravashis or fervers of Mazdeism, the genii which correspond with all created things, and watch over the servants of Ormazd.
A rich mythology was associated with the religion of Zoroaster.
The cosmogony of his followers and the successive creations of Ormazd,
the places, possibly, occupied by the Iranians in their westward migration, may be read in the Bundehesh and the first fargard of the Vendidad. The paradise of the Aryan races was laid in Airyanem vaejo, between the Oxus and Jaxartes, where they were ruled in the
golden age by Yima, the son of Vivanghvat,—called Yama, son of
Vivasvat, in the Veda, —the first man, the lord of the departed, originally the evening darkness. In the Shahnameh of Firdusi, the great Epic of mediaeval Persia, Yima became Jemshid. But the sovereign light, the hwarend, was carried off from Yima Khshaeta, " the shining Yima," by the three-headed serpent of night, Azhi-dahaka,
the biting snake, the tyrant Zohak of Firdusi's epic. ThraStaona, the son of Athwy6, was the chosen hero who subdued the monster, and whom the Shahnameh has changed into Feridun. Born in the " fourcornered Varena " or heaven, he is the Vedic Traitana or Trita Aptya, "the dawn, the son of the waters," whose name reappears in the Homeric epithet of Athena, TpLToyeveia. The serpent was bound to the highest peak of Demttvend, not to be loosed till the end of the world, when he will be slain by Keres^pa, the Gershasp of Firdusi, the Krishashva of Hindu legend. Keresaspa has already killed other monstrous creations of Ahriman, Shravara, the Greek Kerberos, among them, and his reign restored the glory of that of Yima. When Azhi-dahaka is finally slain, a son, Saoshyant, will be born to Zoroaster
who will bring eternal life and light to glorified mankind, as his father once brought them the law and the truth.
Art and Literature. — Persian art was derived from Babylonia through that of Susiana. But it lacked the humorous freedom of Babylonian art ; it was stiff, severe, and formal. The carved gems
were poor imitations of those of Chaldea ; even the signet of Dareios is



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 455
rudely cut, and shows little artistic skill. The palaces were raised on
lofty platforms like those of Babylonia, where such a protection from
the marshy ground was needful ; and the platforms were adorned with
broad, handsome flights of stairs which led to their top. The buildings which stood on them were comparatively small and low, but this was compensated by a profusion of light and elegant columns. The
columns, again, were due to Babylonian inspiration, and their capitals,
^\dth sitting figures of animals, placed back to back and turned sideways towards the spectators, resemble those of Babylon and Nineveh. The colouring of the walls and ceilings was also borrowed from Babylonia, and the bas-reliefs with which the walls were ornamented find their counterpart in the palaces of Assyria. But the subjects were treated in Babylonian and not Assyrian style ; Gizdhubar, transformed into a Persian hero, again slays the demon monster with all the
thickness of limb that characterised Babylonian art, and the Baby
lonian rosette makes its appearance everywhere. On the other hand, the long processions of men and animals, the winged solar disk that symbolises Ormazd, and the struggle between the lion and the bull, remind us of Assyria, though the treatment is thoroughly Babylonian. We feel that the same Accadian artists who inspired the art of Baby
lonia must have inspired the ^rt of Persia as well as the lost art of Elam which preceded it. As in Babylonia, the animal figures are better than the human ones. The winged bulls which guard the entrances of the palaces are Assyrian ; not so, however, the fashion of ornamenting the panels of the doorways with figures in relief. On
the whole, Persian work in relief is clumsy, but vigorous.
The same substantial solidity characterises the architecture, in
spite of the forests of pillars by which its general effect was lightened.
The platforms and staircases are alike massive, the walls are thick,
the doors too narrow for their height. On the other hand, a spirit of harmony and proportion is everywhere observable. The doors exactly face each other ; the columns are erected in uniform rows. Egyptian influence may perhaps be detected in the propylaea through which the
royal palaces were approached, as well as in the head-dress of the man who has the attributes of the winged Asiatic goddess on one of
the pillars of the tomb falsely ascribed to Kyros at Murghab.
Persian architecture may best be studied in the remains of the palace near Persepolis, burnt by Alexander. The buildings erected on the different terraces which form the platform were not connected
with one another. Of the five largest buildings, one was the palace



456 APPENDIX V.
of Dareios, the second that of Xerxes, and the third that of Artaxerx^s Okhos, while the other two are known as the Clielil Minar or hall of
a hundred columns—supported as it was by a hundred columns in ten
rows of ten, each thirty-five feet high and twenty feet distant from
its companion — and the Eastern Palace. The latter contains four
groups of pillars, the largest being a square of thirty-six pillars in six
rows of six, and covering an area of over 20,000 square feet. The rooms seem to have been built round the walls of the several palaces,
while a portico of columns fronted the visitor. The tombs of the Persian monarchs consisted of chambers cut out of the rock, that at Murghab alone excepted.
Persian literature has perished, with the exception of the older
parts of the Avesta, though the references to it in Herodotos, Ktesias,
and other classical writers, show that a good deal once existed. The
so-called historical literature, however, seems to have resembled
Firdusi's Shahnameh, or the histories of foreign nations given by Arabic authors, and to have been mostly legendary. The cursive writing employed for this literature is unknown. The cuneiform alphabet, used for monumental purposes, was probably introduced in the reign of Dareios, The tomb at Murghab, which bears the cuneiform legend, " I am Kyros, the king, the Akhaemenian," cannot belong to the older Kyros, since Murghab was not Pasargadae, where he was buried. It is possibly the sepulchre of the satrap of Egypt,
the brother of Xerxes, who is called Akhaemenes by Ktesias. This would explain the Egyptian head-dress of the sculpture which adorns it. It may, however, have been intended to commemorate a cult of Kyros ; at any rate, the figure represented in the sculptures is not that of a human being, but of a god. The cuneiform alphabet was last employed by ArtaxerxSs Okhos.
Trade and Manners.—The Persians were not a commercial people,
and the trade of the empire was therefore left in the hands of their subjects. The coinage of Dareios was, however, remarkably pure.
Various devices were cut upon one side of the coin, but the only inscription known is one in Greek letters which records the name Pythagoras. Pythagoras may have been a captain of the mercenaries, since a Greek inscription on the upturned base of a column at Susa is
dedicated by " Pythagoras, son of Aristarkho.s, captain of the bodyguard," to " his friend Arreneides, the son of Arreneides, governor of
Susiana." Attic coins were allowed to pass current in Persia, after being impressed with a mark in the shape of a bar.



THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. 457
The Persian form of government after the reign of Dareios has
ah'eady been described (p. 442). Its nearest parallel in modern times is that of the Turkish empire. But the exaggerated flattery and meanspirited subservience of the Persian towards his monarch would be hard to match. His dress implied a cold climate. Drawers and boots were worn by all classes, stockings and gloves by the rich. Horses were largely employed both in war and in peace, and the Persian bowmen were celebrated. Spiked balls were strewn over the field of battle by Dareios Kodomannos, and there were six ranks of military officers under the commander-in-chief, who was always a Persian or a Mede. Prisoners of war were treated kindly, unless they happened to be rebels. The luxury and etiquette of the court were proverbial. The harem was guarded by a dense body of eunuchs, and the king seldom emerged from the secresy of his palace. Cooks and " tastei-s " abounded, and the king reclined on a couch with golden feet, drinking the wine of Helbon, while an inferior beverage was served to his guests seated below. Drunkenness, it may be
observed, was as much a Persian failing as truthfulness was reputed to be a Persian virtue. Hunting, more especially battue shooting in
paradeisoi or enclosed parks, shared the monarch's time with dice
playing, at which large bets wer'e lost and won. Criminals were put
to death for slight offences and in peculiarly cruel ways, and distinc
tions of class were rigidly maintained. Polygamy was allowed, education neglected, and the queen-mother permitted to exercise an
injurious influence over the king, the court, and the empire. In short, the empire contained within it from the first all the elements of decay,
and the Persian character was one which could with difliculty be
respected and never loved.
