PREFATORY NOTE
BY THE EDITOR.
The growing interest both in this country and abroad in the
historical study of religions is one of the noticeable features
in the intellectual phases of the past decades. The more gen
eral indications of this, interest may be seen in such foundations
as the Hibbert and Gifford Lectureships in England, and the
recent organization of an American committee to arrange in
various cities for lectures on the history of religions, in the
establishment of a special department for the subject at the
University of -Paris, in the organization of the Musee Gui
met at Paris, in the publication of a journal — the Revue de
VHistoire des Religions — under the auspices of this Museum,
and in the creation of chairs at the College de France, at the
Universities of Holland, and in this country at Cornell Univer
sity and the University of Chicago,' with the prospect of others
to follow in the near future. For the more special indications
we must turn to the splendid labors of a large array of scholars
toiling in the various departments of ancient culture — India,
Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Phoenicia, China,
Greece, and Rome — with the result of securing a firm basis
for the study of the religions flourishing in those countries
1 In an article by the writer published in the Biblical World (University of Chicago Press) for January, 1893, there will be found an account of the present status of the Historical Study of Religions in this country.

a result due mainly to the discovery of fresh sources and to the
increase of the latter brought about by exploration and incessant
research. The detailed study of the facts of religion every
where, both in primitive society and in advancing civilization,
and the emphasis laid upon gathering and understanding these
facts prior to making one's deductions, has succeeded in set
ting aside the speculations and generalizations that until the
beginning of this century paraded under th^ name of "Philos
ophy of Religion."
Such has been the scholarly activity displayed and the fer
tility resulting, that it seems both desirable and timely to focus,
as it were, the array of facts connected with the religions of
the ancient world in such a manner that the summary resulting
may serve as the point of departure for further investigations.
This has been the leading thought which has suggested the
series of Handbooks on the History of Religions. The treat
ment of the religions included in the series differs from pre
vious attempts in the aim to bring together the ascertained
results of scholarship rather than to make an additional con
tribution, though the character of the scholars whose coopera
tion has been secured justifies the hope that their productions
will also mark an advance in the interpretation of the subject
assigned to each. In accord with this general aim, mere dis
cussion has been limited to a minimum, while the chief stress
has been laid upon the clear and full presentation of the data
connected with each religion.
A uniform plan has been drawn up by the editor for the
order of treatment in the various volumes, by following which it
is hoped that the continuous character of the series will be se

cured. In this plan the needs of the general reader, as well
as those of the student, for whom, in the first place, the series
is designed, have been kept in view. After the introduction,
which in the case of each volume is to be devoted to a setting
forth of the sources and the method of study, a chapter follows
on the land and the people, presenting those ethnographical
and geographical considerations, together with a brief histori
cal sketch of the people in question, so essential to an under
standing of intellectual and religious life everywhere.
In the third section, which may be denominated the kernel of
the book, the subdivisions and order of presentation necessarily
vary, the division into periods being best adapted to one reli
gion, the geographical order for another, the grouping of themes
in a logical sequence for a third ; but in every case, the range
covered will be the same, namely, the beliefs, including the
pantheon, the relation to the gods, views of life and death; the
rites — both the official ones and the popular customs — the reli
gious literature and architecture. A fourth section will furnish
a general estimate of the religion, its history, and the relation
it bears to others. Each volume will conclude with a full bib
liography, index, and necessary rnaps, with illustrations intro
duced into the text as called for. The Editor has been fortu
nate in securing the services of distinguished specialists whose
past labors and thorough understanding of the plan and pur
pose of the series furnish a guarantee for the successful
execution of their task.
It is the hope of the Editor to produce in this way a series
of manuals that may serve as text-books for the historical
study of religions in our universities and seminaries. In ad

dition to supplying this want, the arrangement of the manuals
will, it is expected, meet the requirements of reliable reference

tion, which it will be the aim of the writers to carry out, justi
fies the hope that the general reader will find the volumes no
less attractive and interesting.

PREFACE.
IT has been said somewhere by Lowell that " an illustration
is worth more than any amount of discourse," and, if We were asked to specify in which fegard we thought that this manual, when compared with the only other book that covers the same ground, was likely to be useful, we should reply that, whereas Barth in his admirable handbook (the out
growth of an article in the Encydop'edie des Sciences Religieuses) aimed at making his reader know all about the religions of India, we have sought to make our reader know those religions. We have tried to show the lines on which developed the various theological and moral conceptions of the Hindus, not only by furnishing, from the point of view of a foreign critic, an annotated narrative of the growth of these conceptions, but also and chiefly by taking the reader step by step through the literature that contains the records of India's dogmas. The scheme of Earth's Religions excludes all illustrative matter. His reader
must take as authoritative the word of some modern scholar, or he must look up for himself the texts to which occasional reference is made. By omitting all quotations the author was enabled, in the compass of a small volume, to give an account, extraordinarily compact and complete, of every ramification of Hindu belief, and his book deserves all the praise that it
has won. It is invaluable as exegesis. But it presents the
religions of India as Bernhardy exhibits the literature of
Greece, or as the daylight lecturer describes invisible stars.
If one desire to orient himself in respect of any point of the
Hindu creeds, if he v/ish a reliable sketch of those creeds, he

will obtain from Earth the information he is seeking, and find
a survey not only traced in detail, but at the same time discussed in so masterly a way as to make superfluous for long any new rtsume of the sort, withal despite the fact that in some regards Earth's views have become obnoxious to later criticism. But it is not to criticise Earth that this book was
written. It is to reveal the religions of India by causing them
to reveal themselves, and to elucidate them by commenting on them as they appear before the reader, traverse his field of
vision, and finally leave his sight. We admit that it behooves whoever writes under the same title with that of the French savant, to show cause why he does so ; but we think that to open up the religions of India from within, and in orderly succession to explain them as they display themselves, will not be otiose if there be any students ignorant of Sanskrit who yet desire independently to examine and to make their own the very words of the Hindu sages. In accordance with this plan of teaching Hindu religions we have been more prone to ignore than to collect such results of modern scholarship as tend to blur the picture we would show. For a first view of Greek theology Homer is more useful than Preller, and the same is true elsewhere. Above all, as we have said in the Introduction, in regard to many a recent ' interpretation ' of Hindu deities, we are content to be con
servative. We doubt the historical value of most of these expositions, and, since we are not of those scholars that try to keep abreast of the times by swallowing every new idea, we have not been inclined to broach unsatisfactory theories without a good deal of provocation, which existed for us only in the case of one or two Vedic divinities, where the religious
•significance of new interpretations compelled attention.
In regard to the great length at which we have reviewed the
gods of the earlier period, we have not forgotten what difference exists between mythology and religion, but we believe

that. the reader will see, before he gets to the end of the book, that such amplitude of treatment as we have permitted ourselves was not alien to our proper subject-matter. We scarcely can hope that the professional Indologian will see much that is valuable to him in this work, which is intended only for students, although we think that our view of
the relation of Vedic belief to that of the 'primitive Aryans.'
is one that some scholars of the day might substitute with
advantage for their own. But our more especial field of investigation has lain along the lines marked by the two chapters on Hinduism, and these such Sanskrit scholars as have not made particular study of the Hindu epic perhaps may find to
be readable. Although we have quoted Hindu works more often than we have referred to those of European scholars, yet have we endeavored to make the notes sufificiently copious to put the reader an courant with the most important studies of the present time. As to the method of writing Sanskrit words) being unable to adopt the unpleasant characters of the Sacred Books, and knowing no other system that is satisfactory both to English eye and to linguistic sense, we have employed the simplest
transcription, ignoring, in fact, all Unguals save the sibilant, which alone can be rendered by English letters, and which
usage has long made familiar. E. W. H.

THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
CHAPTER I. — INTRODUCTION.
SOURCES. — DATES. — METHODS OF INTERPRETATION.DIVISIONS OF SUBJECT.
SOURCES.
India always has been a land of religions. In the earliest
Vedic literature are found not only hymns in praise of the accepted gods, but also doubts in regard to the worth of these gods ; the beginnings of a new religion incorporated
into the earliest records of the old. And later, when, about
300 B.C., Megasthenes was in India, the descendants of those first theosophists are still discussing, albeit in more modern
fashion, the questions that lie at the root of all religion.
" Of the philosophers, those that are most estimable he
terms Brahmans (ppa)(jji.ava?) . These discuss with many words concerning death. For they regard death as being, for the
wise, a birth into real life — into the happy life. And in many things they hold the same opinions with the Greeks : saying that the universe was begotten and will be destroyed, and that the world is a sphere, which the god who made and owns it pervades throughout ; that there are different beginnings of all things, but water is the beginning of world-making, while,
in addition to the four elements, there is, as fifth, a kind of
nature, whence came the sky and the stars. . . . And concerning the seed of things and the soul they have much to say also,

whereby they weave in myths, just as does Plato, in regard to
the soul's immortality, judgment in hell, and such things."^ And as India conspicuously is a country of creeds, so is its
literature preeminently priestly and religious. From the first Veda to the last Purana, religion forms either the subject-matter
of the most important works, or, as in the case of the epics,^ the basis of didactic excursions and sectarian interpolations, which impart to worldly themes a tone peculiarly theological. History and oratory are unknown in^ Indian literature. Theearly poetry consists of hymns and religious poems ; the early
prose, of liturgies, linguistics, "law," theology, sacred legends and other works, all of which are intended to supplement the knowledge of the Veda, to explain ceremonies, or to inculcate
religious principles. At a later date, formal grammar and systems of philosophy; fables and commentaries are added to the prose; epics, secular lyric, drama, the Puranas and such
writings to the poetry. But in all this great mass, till that time
which Miiller has called the Renaissance — that is to say, till after the Hindus were come into close contact with foreign nations, notably the Greek, from which has been borrowed,
perhaps, the classical Hindu drama,^ — there is no real litera
ture that was not religious originally, or, at least, so apt for
priestly use as to become chieiiy moral and theosophic ; while the most popular works of modern times are sectarian tracts, Puranas, Tantras and remodelled worldly poetry. The sources, then, from which is to be drawn the knowledge of Hindu
religions are the best possible — the original texts. The infor

Drama; and L6vi, Le thecttre indien. The date of the Renaissance is given as "from the first century B.C. to at least the third century a.d." {India, p. 281). Extant Hindu drama dates only from the fifth century a.d. We exclude, of course from "real literature" all technical hand-books and commentaries.

mation furnished by foreigners, from the times of Ktesias and Megasthenes to that of Mandelslo, is considerable; but one is
warranted in assuming that what little in it is novel is inaccu
rate, since otherwise the information would have been furnished
by the Hindus themselves; and that, conversely, an outsider's
statements, although presumably correct, often may give an
inexact impression through lack of completeness* as when — to
take an example that one can control — Ktesias tells half the
truth in regard to ordeals. ' His account is true, but he gives no notion of the number or elaborate character of these interesting ceremonies.
The sources to which we shall have occasion to refer will be,
then, the two most important collections of Vedic hymns — the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda ; the Brahmanic literature, with the supplementary Upanishads, and the Sutras or mnemonic abridgments of religious and ceremonial rules ; 'the
legal texts, and the religious and theological portions of the
epic ; and the later sectarian writings, called Puranas. The
great heresies, again, have their own special writings. Thus
far we shall draw on the native literature. Only for some of
the modern sects, and for the religions of the wild tribes which have no literature, shall we have to depend on the accounts
of European writers.
DATES.
For none of the native religious works has one a certain date. Nor is there for any one of the earlier compositions
the certainty that it belongs, as a whole, to any one time. The Rig Veda was composed by successive generations ; the Atharvan represents different ages; each Brahman a appears to belong in part to one era, in part to another; the earliest
Sutras (manuals of law, etc.) have been interpolated ; the
earliest metrical code is a composite ; the great epic is the work of centuries ; and not only do the Upanishads and Puranas

represent collectively many different periods, but exactly to which period each individually is to be assigned remains always doubtful. Only in the case of the Buddhistic writings is there a satisfactorily approximate terminus a quo, and even here approximate means merely within the limit of centuries.
Nevertheless, criteria fortunately are not lacking to enable
one to assign- the general bulk of any one work to a certain period in the literary development ; and as these periods are,
if not sharply, yet plainly disting'uishable, one is not in so desperate a case as he might have expected to be, considering that it is impossible to date with certainty any Hindu book or
writer before the Christian era. For, iirst, there exists a difference in langua,ge, demarcating- the most important periods ; and, secondly, the development of the literature has been upon such lines that it is easy to say, from content and method of
treatment, whether a given class of writings is a product of the Vedic, early Brahmanic, or late Brahmanic epochs. Usually, indeed, one is unable to tell whether a later Upanishad
was made first in the early or late Brahmanic period, but it is known that the Upanishads, as a whole, i.e., the literary form
and philosophical 'material which characterize Upanishads, were earlier than the latest Brahmanic period and subsequent to the early Brahmanic period ; that they arose at the close of
the latter and before the rise of the former. So the Brahmanas, as a whole, are subsequent to the Vedic age, although some of the Vedic hymns appear to have been made up in the same period with that of the early Brahmanas. Again, the
Puranas can be placed with safety after the late Brahmanic age; and, consequently, subsequent to the Upanishads, although it is probable that many Upanishads were written after the first Puranas. The general compass of this enormous
literature is from an indefinite antiquity to about 1500 a.d.
A liberal margin of possible error must be allowed in the
assumption of any specific dates. The received opinion is that



DA TES. S
the Rig Veda goes back to about 2000 B.C., yet are some scholkrs inclined rather to accept 3000 B.C. as the t]me that
represents this era. Weber, in his Lectures on Sanskrit Litera
ture {^. 7), rightly says that to seek for an exact date is fruitless
labor; while Whitney compares Hindu dates to ninepins — set up only to be bowled down again. Schroeder, in his Lndiens
Literatur unci Cultiir, suggests that the prior limit may be " a few centuries earlier than 1500," agreeing with Weber's preferred reckoning; but Whitney, Grassmann, and Benfey provisionally
assume 2000 B.C. as the starting point of Hindu literature.
The lowest possible limit for this event Miiller now places at about 1500, which is recognized as a very cautious view; most scholars thinking that Miiller's estimate gives too little
time for the development of the literary periods, which, in their
opinion, require, linguistically and otherwise, a greater number of years. Brunnhofgr more recently has suggested 2800 B.C. as the terminus ; while the last writers on the subject (Tilak and Jacobi) claim to have discovered that the period from 3500 to 2500 represents the Vedic age. Their conclusions, however, are not very convincing, and have been disputed vigorously."^ Without the hope of persuading such scholars as are wedded to a terminus of three or four thousand years
ago that we are right, we add, in all deference to others, our own opinion on this vexed question. Buddhism gives the first
semblance of a date in Hindu literature. Buddha lived in the sixth centnjry, and died probably about 480, possibly (Westergaard's extreme opinion) as late as 368.^ Before this time
arise the Sutras, back of which lie the earliest Upanishads, the bulk of the Brahmanas, and all the Vedic poems. Now it is probable that the Brahmanic literature itself extends to the
1 Jacobi, in Roth's Feslgruss, pp. 72, 73 (1893); Whitney, Proceed. A. O. S., 1894, p. Ixxxii ; Perry, Piis/ian, in the Drisler Memorial; Weber, Vedisclie Beitrdge. 2 Westergaard, Ueber Buddha's Todesjahr. The prevalent opinion is that Buddha died in 477 or 480 B.C.



6 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
time of Buddha and perhaps beyond it. For the rest of preBuddhistic literature it seems to us incredible that it is necessary to require, either from the point of view of linguistic or of social and i-eligious development, the enormous period of two thousand years. There are no other grounds on which to base a reckoning except those of Jacobi and his Hindu rival, who build on Vedic data results that hardly support the
superstructure they have erected. Jacobi's starting-point is from a mock-serious hymn, which appears to be late and does not establish, to whatever date it be assigned, the point of departure from which proceeds his whole argument, as Whitney has shown very well. One is driven back to the needs of
a literature in respect of time sufficient for it to mature. What changes take place in language, even with a written
literature, in the space of a few centuries, may be seen in Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. No two thousand years are required to bridge the linguistic extremes of the Vedic and classical Sanskrit language.^ But in content it will be
seen that the flower of the later literature is budding already in
the Vedic age. We are unable to admit that either in language or social development, or in literary or religious growth, more than a few centuries are necessary to account for the whole development of Hindu literature (meaning thereby compositions, whether written or not) up to the time of Buddha. Moreover, if one compare the period at which arise the earliest forms of literature among other Aryan peoples, it will seem very strange that, whereas in the case of the Romans, Greeks,
and Persians, one thousand years B.C. is the extreme limit of such literary activity as has produced durable wofks, the Hindus two or three thousand years B.C. were creating
1 It must not be forgotten in estimating the broad mass of Brahmanas and Sutras that each as a school represents almost the whole length of its period, and hence one school alone should measure the time from end to end, which reduces to very moderate dimensions the literature to be accounted for in tinie.



DATES. 7
poetry so finished, so refined, and, from a metaphysical point of view, so advanced as is that of the Rig Veda. If, as is generally assumed, the (prospective) Hindus and
Persians were last to leave the common Aryan habitat, and
came together to the south-east, the difficulty is increased ;
especially in the light of modern opinion in regard to the ficti
tious antiquity of Persian (Iranian) literature. For if Darme
steter be correct in holding the time of the latter to be at niost a century before our era, the incongruity between
that oldest date of Persian literature and the " two or three thousand years before Christ," which are claimed in the case
of the Rig Veda, becomes so great as to make the latter assumption more dubious than ever. We think in a word, without wishing to be dogmatic, that the date of the Rig Veda is about on a par, historically, with that of ' Homer,' that is to say, the Collection' represents a long period, which was completed perhaps two hundred years after looo B.C., while again its earliest beginnings precede that date possibly by five centuries ; but we would assign the bulk of the Rig Veda to about looo B.C. With conscious imitation of older speech a good deal of archaic linguistic eKect doubt
less was produced by the latest poets, who really belong to the Brahmanic age. The Brahmanic age in turn ends, as we opine, about 500 B.C., overlapping the Sutra period as well as
that of the first Upanishads. The former class of writings
(after 500 b.c. one may talk of writings) is represented by
dates that reach from circa 600-500 B.C. nearly to our era.
Buddhism's floruit is from 500 B.C. to 500 a.d., and epic Hinduism covers nearly the same centuries. From 500 to 1000 Buddhism is in a state of decadence ; and through this time extepd the dramatic and older Puranic writings ; while other

Puranas are as late as 1500, at which time, arises the great
modern reforming sect of the Sikhs. In the matter of the earlier termini a century may be added or subtracted here and there,
but these convenient divisions of five hundreds will be found
on the whole to be sufficiently accurate.-'
METHODS OF INTERPRETATION.
At the outset of his undertaking a double problem pre'sents itself to one that would give, even in compact form, a view of
Hindu religions. This problem consists in explaining, and, in
so far as is possible, reconciling opposed opinions in regard not only to the nature of these religions but also to the method of interpreting the Vedic hymns. That the Vedic religion was naturalistic and mytho-poetic is doubted by few. The Vedic hymns laud the powers of nature and natural phenomena as personified gods, or even as impersonal phenomena. They praise also as distinct powers the departed fathers. In the Rig Veda I. 168, occur some verses in honor of the storm-gods called Maruts : " Self-yoked are they come lightly from the sky. The immortals urge themselves on with the goad. Dustless, born of power, with shining spears the Maruts overthrow the strongholds. Who is it, O Maruts, ye that have lightning-spears, that impels you within ?
. . . The streams roar from the tires, when they send out their cloud- voices," etc. Nothing would seem more justifiable, in view of this hymn and of many like it, than to assume with Miiller and other Indologians, that the Marut-gods are personifications of natural phenomena. As clearly do Indra and the Dawn appear to be natural phenomena. But no less an authority than Herbert Spencer has attacked this view : " Facts imply that
1 Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur^ p. 291, gives : Rig-Veda 2000-1000 B.C.; older Brahmanas, 1000-800; later Brahmanas and Upanishads, 800-600 • Siitras, 600-400 or 300.



METHODS OF INTERPRETATION. 9
the conception of the dawn as a person results from the giving of dawn as a birth-name." " And again : "If, then, Dawn [in New Zealand and elsewhere] is an actual name for a person,
if where there prevails this mode of distinguishing children, it has probably often been given to those born early in the morning; the traditions concerning one of such who became noted,
would, in the mind of the uncritical savage . . . lead to identification with the dawn." ^ In another passage : " The primi
tive god is the superior man . . . propitiated during his life and still more after his death." * Summing up, Spencer thus concludes : " Instead of seeing in the common character of so-called myths, that they describe combats of beings using weapons, evidence that they arose out of human transactions ; mythologists assume that the order of Nature presents itself to the undeveloped mind in terms of victories and defeats."^ Moreover (a posteriori)., " It is not true that the primitive man looks at the powers of Nature with awe. It is not true that he speculates about their characters and causes." ^ If Spencer had not included in his criticism the mythologists that have written on Vedic religion, there would be no occasion to take
his opinion into consideration. But since he claims by the light of his comparative studies to have shown that in the Rig Veda the "so-called nature gods," ^ were not the oldest, and explains Dawn here exactly as he does in New Zealand, it becomes necessary to point out, that apart from the question
of the origin of religions in general, Spencer has made a fatal
error in assuming that he is dealing in the Rig Veda with primitive religion, uncritical savages, and undeveloped minds.
And furthermore, as the poet of the Rig Veda is not primitive, or savage, or undeveloped, so when he worships Dyaus pitar
(Zev! TiaT-fip) as the 'sky-father,' he not only makes it evident

to every reader that he really is worshipping the visible sky above ; but in his descriptions of gods such as Indra, the Dawn, and some other new gods he invents from time to time, long after he has passed the savage, primitive, and undeveloped state, he makes it no less clear that he worships phenomena
as they stand before him (rain, cloud, lightning, etc.), so that
by analogy with what is apparent in the case of later divinities,
one is led inevitably to predicate the same origin as theirs in
the case of the older gods. But it is unnecessary to spend time on this point. It is impossible for any sober scholar to read the Rig Veda and believe that the Vedic poets are not worshipping natural phenomena ; or that the phenomena so worshipped were not the original forms of these gods. Whether at a more remote time there was ever a period when the pre-historic Hindu, or his preIndic ancestor, worshipped the Manes exclusively is another question, and one with which at present we have nothing to do. The history of Hindu religions begins with the Rig Veda, and in this period the worship of Manes and that of natural
phenomena were distinct, nor are there any indications that the latter was ever developed from the former. It is not denied that the Hindus made gods of departed men. They did this long after the Vedic period. But there is no proof that all the Vedic gods, as claims Spencer, were the worshipped souls of the dead. No argnmentum afero can show in a Vedic dawn-hymn anything other than a hymn to personified Dawn, or make it probable that this dawn was ever a mortal's name. In respect of that which precedes all tradition we, whose
task is not to speculate in regard to primitive religious conceptions, but to give the history of one people's religious progress, may be pardoned for expressing no opinion. But without abandoning history (i.e., tradition) we would revert for a moment
to the pre-Indian period and point out that Zarathustra's rejection of the daevas, which must be the same devas that are

worshipped in India, proves that i^CT'a-worship is the immediate predecessor of the Hindu religion. As far back as one can
scrutinize the Aryan past he finds, as the earliest known objects
of reverence, 'sun' and 'sky,' besides and "beside the blessed Manes. A word here regarding the priority of monotheism or
of polytheism. The tradition is in favor of the latter, while on
a /rwr/ grounds whoever thinks that the more primitive the race
the more apt it is for monotheism will postulate, with some of
the older scholars, an assumed monotheism as the pre-historic religion of the Hindus ; while whosoever opines that man has
gradually risen from a less intellectual stage will see in the early gods of the Hindus only another illustration of one universal fact, and posit even Aryan polytheism as an advance on the religion which it is probable that the remoter ancestors of the Aryans once acknowledged. A word perhaps should be said, also, in order to a better understanding between the ethnologists as represented by Andrew Lang, and the unfortunate philologists whom it delights him to pommel. Lang's clever attacks on the myth
makers, whom he persistently describes as the philologists
and they do indeed form part of that camp — have had the effect of bringing ' philological theories ' into sad disrepute with sciolists and ' common-sense ' people. But the sun-myths and dawn-myths that the myth-makers discover' in Cinderella and Red Riding Hood, ought not to be fathered upon all philologists. On the other hand, who will deny that in India certain mythological figures are eoian or solar in origin ? Can any one question that Vivasvant the ' wide gleaming ' is sun or bright sky, as he is represented in the Avesta and Rig Veda.' Yet is a very anthropomorphic, nay, earthly figure, made out of this god. Or is Mr. Lang ignorant that the god Yima became Jemshid, and that Feridun is only the god Trita 1 It undoubtedly is correct to illuminate the past with other light than that of sun or dawn, yet that these lights have shone and

have been quenched in certain personaHties may be granted
without doing violence to scientific principles; All purely etymological mythology is precarious, but one may recognize sun-myths without building a system on the basis of a DawnHelen, and without referring Ilium to the Vedic bila. Again,
myths about gods, heroes, and fairies are to be segregated. Even in India, which teems with it, there is little, if any, folk
lore that can be traced to solar or dawn-born myths. Mr. Lang represents a healthy reaction against too much sun-myth, but we think that there are sun-myths still, and that despite his
protests all religion is not grown from one seed. There remains the consideration of the second part of the
double problem which was formulated above — the method of interpretation. The native method is to believe the scholiasts'
explanations, which often are fanciful and, in all important points, totally unreliable ; since the Hindu commentators lived so long after the period of the literature they expound that
the tradition they follow is useful only in petty details. From
a modern point of view the question of interpretation depends mainly on whether one regard the Rig Veda as but an Indie • growth, the product of the Hindu mind alone, or as a work that still retains from an older age ideas which, having once been common to Hindu and Iranian, should be compared with those in the Persian Avesta and be illustrated by them. Again,
if this latter hypothesis be correct, how is one to interpret an
apparent likeness, here and there, between Indie and foreign
notions, — is it possible that the hymns were composed, in
part, before the advent of the authors into India, and is it for this reason that in the Rig Veda are contained certain names, ideas, and legends, which do not seem to be native to India ? On the other hand, if one adopt the theory that the Rig Veda is wholly a native work, in how far is he to suppose that it is , separable from Brahmanic formalism ? Were the hymns made
independently of any ritual, as their own excuse for being, or



METHODS OF INT:ERPkETATION. 13
were they composed expressly for the sacrifice, as part of a formal cult ? Here are views diverse enough, but each has its advocate or advocates. According to the earlier European writers the Vedic poets are fountains of primitive thought, streams unsullied
by any tributaries, and in reading them one quaffs a fresh draught, the gush of unsophisticated herdsmen, in whose religion there is to be seen a childlike belief in natural phenomena
as divine forces, over which forces stands the Heaven-god as the highest power. So in 1869 Pfleiderer speaks of the " primeval childlike naive prayer" of Rig Veda vi. 51. 5 ("Father
sky, mother earth," etc.);'' while Pictet, in his work Lei Ofi
gines Indo-Europkennes, maintains that the Aryans had a primitive monotheism, although it was vague and rudimentary ; for he regards both Iranian dualism and Hindu polytheism as being developments of one earlier monism (claiming that Iranian dualism is really monotheistic). Pictet's argument is that the human mind must have advanced from the simple to the complex ! Even Roth believes in an originally " supreme deity" of the Aryans.^ Opposed to this, the 'naive' school of
such older scholars as Roth, Miiller,^ and Grassmann, who see in the Rig Veda an ingenuous expression of ' primitive ' ideas, stand the theories of Bergaigne, who interprets everything
allegorically; and of Pischel and Geldner, realists, whose general opinions may thus be formulated : The poets of the Rig Veda are not childlike and naive ; they represent a compara
tively late period of culture, a society not only civilized, but even sophisticated ; a mode of thought philosophical and scep

Approvingly cited, SBE. xxxii. p. 243 (1891).



14 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
tical; a religion not only ceremonious but absolutely stereotyped.In regard to the Aryanhood of the hymns, the stand taken by these latter critics, who renounce even Bergaigne's slight hold on mythology, is that the Rig Veda is thoroughly Indie.
It is to be explained by the light of the formal Hindu ritual
ism, and even by epic worldliness, its fresh factors being lewd gods, harlots, and race-horses. Bloom^eld, who does not go
so far as this, claims that the 'Vedic' age really is a Brahmanic
age ; that Vedic religion is saturated with Brahmanic ideas and Brahmanic formalism, so that the Rig Veda ought to be
looked upon as made for the ritual, not the ritual regarded as ancillary to the Rig Veda.^ This scholar maintains that there is scarcely any chronological distinction between the hymns of the Rig Veda and the Brahmana, both forms having probably existed together "from earliest times"; and that not a single Vedic hymn " was ever composed without reference to ritual application''; nay, all the hymns were
" liturgical from the very start." ^ This is a plain advance even on Bergaigne's opinion, who finally regarded all the family-books of the Rig Veda as composed to subserve the soma-cv^X? In the Rig Veda occur hymns of an entirely worldly character, the lament of a gambler, a humorous description of frogs croaking like priests, a funny picture of contemporary morals
(describing how every one lusts after wealth), and so forth. From these alone it becomes evident that the ritualistic view must be regarded as one somewhat exaggerated. But if the liturgical extremist appears to have stepped a little beyond
the boundary of probability, he yet in daring remains far
1 The older view may be seen in Miiller's Lecture on the Vedas (Chips, I. p. 9)
:
" A collection made for its own sake, and not for the sake of any sacrificial performance." For Pischel's view, compare Vedische Studien, I. Preface. 2 Bloomfield, JAOS., xv. p. 144. 3 Compare Barth (Preface): "A literature preeminently sacerdotal. . . . The poetry ... of a singularly refined character, . . . full of . . . pretensions to mysticism," etc.



METHODS OF INTERPRETATION. IS
behind Bergaigne's disciple Regnaud, who has a mystical 'system,' which is, indeed, the outcome of Bergaigne's great work, though it is very improbable that the latter would have looked with favor upon his follower's results. In Le Rig Veda (Paris, 1892) Paul Regnaud, emphasizing again the connection between the liturgy and the hymns, refers every word of
the Rig Veda to the sacrifice in its simplest form, the oblation. According to this author the Hindus had forgotten the meaning of their commonest words, or consistently employed them
in their hymns in a meaning different to that in ordinary use. The very word for god, deva (deus), no longer means the ' shining one' (the god), but the 'burning oblation'; the common word for mountain, giri, also, means oblation, and so on. This is Bergaigne's allegorical mysticism run mad. At such perversion of reasonable criticism is the exegesis of the Veda arrived in one direction. But in another it is gone
astray no less, as misdirected by its clever German leader. In three volumes ^ Brunnhofer has endeavored to prove that far from being a Brahmanic product, the Rig Veda is not even the work of Hindus ; that it was composed near the Caspian Sea long before the Aryans descended into India. Brunnhofer's books are a mine of ingenious conjectures, as suggestive in detail as on the whole they are unconvincing. His fundamental error is the fancy that names and ideas which might be Iranian or Turanian would prove, if such they really could be shown to be, that the work in which they are contained must be Iranian or Turanian. He relies in great measure on passages that always have been thought to be late, either whole late hymns or tags added to old hymns, and on the most daring changes in the text, changes which he makes in order
to prove his hypothesis, although there is no necessity for making them. The truth that underlies Brunnhofer's extrava
1 Iran und Turan^ 1889 ; Vom Pontus bis zitm Indus, 1890 ; Vom Aral bis zurGangS, 1892.



16 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
gance is that there are foreign names in the Rig Veda, and
this is all that he has proved thus far. ' In regard to the relation between the Veda and the Avesta the difference of views is too individual to have formed systems
of interpretation on that basis alone. Every competent
. scholar recognizes a close affinity between the Iranian Yima and the Hindu Yama, between the soma-oxXt and the haomacult, but in how far the thoughts and forms that have clustered about one development are to be compared with those of the other there is no general agreement and there can be none. The usual practice, however, is to call the Iranian Yima, haoma, etc., to one's aid if they subserve one's own view of Yama, soma, and other Hindu parallels, and to discard analogous
features as an independent growth if they do not. This procedure is based as well on the conditions of the problem as on the conditions of human judgment, and must not be criticized
too severely ; for in fact the two religions here and there touch
each other so nearly that to deny a relation between them is
impossible, while in detail they diverge so widely that it is always questionable whether a coincidence of ritual or belief
be accidental or imply historical connecfion.
It is scarcely advisable in a concise review of several reli
gions to enter upon detailed criticism of the methods of inter
pretation that affect for the most part' only the earliest of them. But on one point, the reciprocal relations between the Vedic and Brahmanic periods, it is necessary to say a few words. Why is it that well-informed Vedic scholars differ so widely
in regard to the ritualistic share in the making of the Veda?
Because the extremists on either side in formulating the prin
ciples of their system forget a fact that probably no one of them if questioned would fail to acknowledge. The Rig Veda is not a homogeneous whole. It is a work which successive generations have produced, and in which are represented different views, of local or sectarian origin ; while the hymns from a



METHODS OF INTERPRETATION. 17
literary point of view are of varying value. The latter is a fact which has been ignored frequently, but it is more important than any other. For one has almost no criteria, with which to discover whether the hymns precede or follow the ritual, other
than the linguistic posteriority of the ritualistic literature, and the knowledge that there were priests with a ritual when some of the hymns were composed. The bare fact that hymns are found rubricated in the later literature is surely no reason for
believing that such hymns were made for the ritual. Now while it can be shown that a large number of hymns are formal, conventional, and mechanical in expression, and while it may be argued with plausibility that these were composed to serve the purpose of an established cult, this is very far from being the case with many which, on other grounds, may be supposed to belong severally to the older and later part of the Rig Veda. Yet does the new school, in estimating the hymns, never admit this. The poems always are spoken of as ' sacer
dotal,' ' ritualistic,' without the slightest attempt to see whether
this be true of all or of some alone. We claim that it is not
historical, it is not judicious from a literary point of view, to
fling indiscriminately -together the hymns that are evidently
ritualistic and those of other value ; for, finally, it is a sober literary judgment that is the court of appeals in regard to whether poetry be poetry or not. Now let one take a hymn containing, to make' it an unexceptionable example, nothing
very profound or very beautiful. It is this well-known
Hymn to the Sun (Rig Veda, I. 50).
Aloft this all-wise 1 shining god His beams of light are bearing now, That every one the sun may see.
1 Or "all-possessing" (Whitney). The metre of the translation retains the number of feet in the original. Four (later added) stanzas are here omitted.



18 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Apart, as were they thieves, yon stars, Together with the night,i withdraw Before the sun, who seeth all.
His beams of light have been beheld Afar, among (all) creatures ; rays Splendid as were they (blazing) files.
Impetuous-swift, beheld of all. Of light the maker, thou, O Sun, Thou all the gleaming (sky) illum'st.
Before the folk of shining gods Thou risest up, and men before.
Tore all — to be as light beheld ;
(To be) thine eye, O pure bright Heaven, Wherewith amid (all) creatures born Thou gazest down on busy (man).
Thou goest across the sky's broad place, Meting with rays, O Sun, the days. And watching generations pass.
The steeds are seven that at thy car Bear up the god whose hair is flame O shining god, O Sun far-seen !
Yoked hath he now his seven fair steeds, The daughters of the sun-god's car, Yoked but by him ; ^ with these he comes.
For some thousands of years these verses have been the daily prayer of the Hindu. They have been incorporated into the ritual in this form. They are rubricated, and the nine
stanzas form part of a prescribed service. But, surely, it were a literary hysteron-proteron to conclude for this reason that they were made only to fill a part in an established ceremony.

For ' Heaven,' here and below, see the third chapter. 2 Yoked only by him ; literally, " self-yoked." Seven is used in the Rig Veda in the general sense of " many," as in Shakespeare's " a vile thief this seven years."

The praise is neither perfunctory nor lacking in a really religious
tone. It has a directness and a simplicity, without affectation,
which would incline one to believe that it was not made mechanically, but composed with a devotional spirit that gave
voice to genuine feeling.
We will now translate another poem (carefully preserving all the tautological phraseology), a hymn
To Dawn {Rig Veda, VI. 64).
Aloft the lights of Dawn, for beauty gleaming, Have risen resplendent, like to waves of water ; She makes fair paths, (makes) all accessible
;
And good is she, munificent and kindly.
Thou lovely lookest, through wide spaces shin'st thou. Up fly thy fiery shining beams to heaven ; Thy bosom thou reveals't, thyself adorning, Aurora, goddess gleaming bright in greatness.
The ruddy kine (the clouds) resplendent bear her. The Blessed One, who far and wide extendeth. As routs his foes a hero armed with arrows, As driver swift, so she compels the darkness.
Thy ways are fair ; thy paths, upon the mountains ; In calm, self-shining one, thou cross'st the waters. O thou whose paths are wide, to us, thou lofty Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth for our subsistence.
Bring (wealth), thou Dawn, who, with the kine, untroubled Dost bring us good commensurate with pleasure, Daughter of Heaven, who, though thou art a goddess, Didst aye at morning-call come bright and early.
Aloft the birds fly ever from their dwelling, And men, who seek for food, at thy clear dawning. E'en though a mortal stay at home and serve thee. Much joy to him. Dawn, goddess (bright), thou bringest.
The " morning call " might, indeed, suggest the ritual, but
it proves only a morning prayer or offering. Is this poem

of a "singularly refined character," or "preeminently sacer
dotal " in appearance ? One other example (in still a different
metre) may be examined, to see if it bear on its face evidence of having been made with " reference to ritual application," or
of being " liturgical from the very start."
To Indra {Rig Veda, I. ii).
'Tis Indra all (our) songs extol, Him huge as ocean in extent
;
Of warriors chiefest warrior he, Lord, truest lord for booty's gain.
In friendship, Indra, strong as thine Naught will we fear, O lord of strength
;
To thee we our laudations sing, The conqueror unconquered.i
The gifts of Indra many are. And inexhaustible his help Whene'er to them that praise he gives The gift of booty rich in kine.
A fortress-render, youthful, wise, Immeasurably strong was born Indra, the doer of every deed, The lightning-holder, far renowned.
'Twas thou, Bolt-holder, rent'st the cave Of Val, who held the (heavenly) kine ;
^
Thee helped the (shining) gods, when roused (To courage) by the fearless one.'
1 Jetaram dpardjitam. 2 The rain, see next note. 3 After this stanza two interpolated stanzas are here omitted. Grassman and Ludwig give the epithet " fearless " to the gods and to Vala, respectively. But compare I. 6, 7, where the same word is used of Indra. For the oft-mentioned act of cleaving the cave, where the dragon Val or Vritra (the restrainer or envelopper) had coralled the kine (?>., without metaphor, for the act of freeing the clouds and letting loose the rain), compare 1. 32. 2, where of Indra it is said: "He slew the snake that lay upon the mountains . . . like bellowing kine the waters, swiftly flowing, descended to the sea"; and verse 11 : "Watched by the snake the waters stood . . . the waters' covered cave he opened wide, what time he Vritra slew."



METHODS &F INTERPRETATION. 21
Indra, who lords it by his strength, Our praises now have loud proclaimed ; His generous gifts a thousand are, Aye, even more than this are they.
This is poetry. Not great poetry perhaps, but certainly not ground out to order, as some of the hymns appear to have been. Yet, it may be said, why could not a poetic hymn have been written in a ritualistic environment ? But it is on the
hymns themselves that one is forced to depend for the belief in the existence of ritualism, and we claim that such hymns as
these, which we have translated as literally as possible, show rather that they were composed without reference to ritual
application. It must not be forgotten that the ritual, as it is known in the Brahmanas, without the slightest doubt, from the point of view of language, social conditions, and theology,
represents an age that is very different to that illustrated by the mass of the hymns. Such hymns, therefore, and only such as can be proved to have a ritualistic setting can be referred to a ritualistic age. There is no convincing reason why one should not take the fully justified view that some of the hymns represent a freer and more natural (less priestbound) age, as they represent a spirit freer and less mechanical than that of other hymns. As to the question which hymns,
early or late, be due to poetic feeling, and which to ritualistic mechanism or servile imitation, this can indeed be decided by a judgment based only on the literary quality, never on the
accident of subsequent rubrication.
We hold, therefore, in this regard, that the new school, valu
able and suggestive as its work has been, is gone already farther than is judicious. The Rig Veda in part is synchronous with an advanced ritualism, subjected to it, and in some cases derived from it ; but in part the hymns are " made for their own sake and not for the sake of any sacrificial perform
ance," as said Miiller of the whole ; going in this too far, but



22 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
not into greater error than are gone they that confuse the natural with the artificial, the poetical with the mechanical,
gold with dross. It may be true that the books of the Rig Veda are chiefly family-books for the soma-cViA, but even were it true it would in no wise impugn the poetic character of some of the hymns contained in these books. The drag-net has scooped up old and new, good and bad, together. The Rig Veda is not of one period or of one sort. It is a ' Collection,' as says its name. It is essentially impossible that any sweep
ing statement in regard to its character should be true if that
character be regarded as uniform. To say that the Rig Veda represents an age of childlike thought, a period before the
priestly ritual began its spiritual blight, is incorrect. But no
less incorrect is it to assert that the Rig Veda represents a period when hymns are made only for rubrication by priests that sing only for baksheesh. Scholars are too prone to-day to speak of the Rig Veda in the same way as the Greeks spoke of Homer. It is to be hoped that the time may soon come when critics will no longer talk about the Collection as if it were all made in the same circumstances and at the same time ; above all is it desirable that the literary quality of the hymns may re
ceive due attention, and that there may be less of those universal asseverations which treat the productions of generations of poets as if they were the work of a single author. In respect of the method of reading into the Rig Veda what is found in parallel passages in the Atharva Veda and Brahmanas, a practice much favored by Ludwig and others, the results of its application have been singularly futile in passages of importance. Often a varied reading will make clearer a doubtful
verse, but it by no means follows that the better reading is the truer. There always remains the lurking suspicion that the
reason the variant is more intelligible is that its inventor did
not understand the original. As to real elucidation of other
sort by the later texts, in the minutiae of the outer world, in



METHODS OF INTERPRETATION. 23
details of priestcraft, one may trust early tradition tentatively,
just as one does late commentators, but in respect of ideas
tradition is as apt to mislead as to lead well. The cleft between the theology of the Rig Veda and that of the Brahmanas, even from the point of view of the mass of hymns that
comprise the former, is too great to allow us with any content
to explain the conceptions of the one by those of the other.
A tradition always is useful when nothing else offers itself, but
traditional beliefs are so apt to take the color of new eras that they should be employed only in the last emergency, and then with the understanding that they are of very hypothetical value. In conclusion a practical question remains to be answered. In the few cases where the physical basis of a Rig Vedic deity is matter of doubt, is it advisable to present such a deity in the form in which he stands in the text or to endeavor historically
to elucidate the figure by searching for his physical prototype ? We have chosen the former alternative, partly because we think the latter method unsuitable to a handbook, since it
involves many critical discussions of theories of doubtful value. But this is not the chief reason. Granted that the object of study is simply to know the Rig Veda, rightly to grasp the views held by the poets, and so to place oneself upon their plane of thought, it becomes obvious that the farther the student gets from their point of view the less he understands them. Nay, more, every bit of information, real as well as
fancied, which in regard to the poets' own divinities furnishes one with more than the poets themselves knew or imagined,
is prejudicial to a true knowledge of Vedic beliefs. Here
if anywhere is applicable that test of desirable knowledge formulated as das Erkennen des Erkannten. To set oneself in the mental sphere of tlie Vedic seers, as far as possible to
think their thoughts, to love, fear, and admire with them this is the necessary beginning of intimacy, which precedes the appreciation that gives understanding.



24 THE RELIGIONS OF li^DIA.
DIVISIONS OF THE SUBJECT.
After the next chapter, which deals with the people and land, we shall begin the examination of Hindu religions with
the study of the beliefs and religious notions to be found in the Rig Veda. Next to the Rig Veda in time stands the Atharva Veda, which represents a growing demonology in con
trast with j-OT«a-worship and theology ; sufificiently so at least
to deserve a special chapter. These two Vedic Collections
naturally form the first period of Hindu religion. The Vedic period is followed by what is usually termed Brahmanism, the religion that is inculcated in the rituals called Brahmana and its later development in the Upanishads. These two classes of works, together with the Yajur Veda, will make the next divisions of the whole subject. The formal religion of Brahmanism, as laid down for popular use and
instruction in the law-books, is a side of Brahmanic religion
that scarcely has been noticed, but it seems to deserve all the space allotted to it in the chapter on ' The Popular Brahmanic Faith.' We shall then review Jainism and Buddhism, the two chief heresies. Brahmanism penetrates the great epic poem which, however, in its present form is sectarian in tendency, and should be separated as a growth of Hinduism from the literature of pure Brahmanism. Nevertheless, so intricate and perplexing would be the task of unraveling the theologic threads that together make the yarn of the epic, and in many cases it would be so doubtful whether any one thread led to Brahmanism or
to the wider and more catholic religion called Hinduism, that we should have preferred to give up the latter name altogether, as one that was for the most part idle, and in some degree misleading. Feeling, however, that a mere manual should not
take the initiative in coining titles, we have admitted this un
satisfactory word ' Hinduism ' as the title of a chapter which undertakes to give a comprehensive view of the religions

endorsed by the many-centuried epic^ and to explain theii mutual relations. As in the case of the ' Popular Faith,' we have had here no models to go upon, and the mass of matter
which it was necessary to handle — the great epic is about
eight times as long as the Iliad and Odyssey put together must be our excuse for many imperfections of treatment in this part of the work. The reader will gain at least a view of the
religious development as it is exhibited in the literature, and
therefore, as far as possible, in chronological order. The
modern sects and the religions of the hill tribes of India form almost a necessary supplement to these nobler religions of the
classical literature ; the former because they are the logical as
well as historical continuation of the great Hindu sectarian
schisms, the latter because they give the solution of some problems connected with Qivaism, and, on the other hand, offer useful un- Aryan parallels to a few traits which have been
preserved in the earliest period of the Aryans.''
1 Aryan, Sanskrit aryh, drya, Avestan airya, appears to mean the loyal or the good, and may be the original national designation, just as the Medes were long called "Apwji. In late Sanskrit arya is simply 'noble.' The word survives, perhaps, in &ptiTTOSt and is found in proper names, Persian Ariobarzanes, Teutonic Ariovistus; as well as in the names of people and countries, Vedic Aryas, Iran, Iranian ; (doubtful) Airem, Erin, Ireland. Compare Zimmer, BB. ill. p. 137 ; Kaegi, Ver Rig Veda, p. 144 (Arrowsmith's translation, p. 109). In the Rig Veda there is a god Aryaman, *the true,' who forms with Mitra and Varuna a triad (see below). Windisch questions the propriety of identifying Iran with Erin, and Schrader (p. 584^) doubts whether the Indo-Europeans as a body ever called themselves Aryans. We employ the latter name because it is short.



CHAPTER II.
PEOPLE AND LAND.
The Aryan Hindus, whose religions we describe in this volume,^ formed one of the Aryan or so-called Indo-European peoples. To the other peoples of this stock, Persians, Ar
menians, Greeks, Italians, Kelts, Teutons, Slavs, the Hindus were related closely by language, but very remotely from the
point of view of their primitive religion. Into India the Aryans
brought little that was retained in their religious systems. A
few waning gods, the worship of ancestors, and some simple rites are common to them and their western relations ; but with the exception of the Iranians (Persians), their religious
connection with cis-Indic peoples is of the slightest. With the Iranians, the Hindus (that were to be) appear to have lived longest in common after the other members of the Aryan host were dispersed to west and south.^ They stand in closer rehgious touch with these, their nearest neighbors, and in the
time of the Rig Veda (the Hindus' earliest literature) there are traces of a connection comparatively recent between the pantheons of the two nations.
According, to their own, rather uncertain, testimony, the Aryans of the Rig Veda appear to have consisted of five tribal
groups.' These groups, Janas, Latin gens, are subdivided into
1 We take this opportunity of stating that by the religions of the Aryan Hindus
we mean the religions of a people who, undoubtedly, were full-blooded Aryans at
first, however much their blood may have been diluted later by un-Aryan admixture. Till the time of Buddhism the religious literature is fairly Aryan. In the period
of " Hinduism" neither people nor religion can claim to be quite Aryan. 2 If, as thinks Schrader, the Aryans' original seat was on the Volga, then one
must imagine the Indo-Iranians to have kept together in a south-eastern emigration.
3 That is to say, frequent reference is made to ' five tribes.' Some scholars deny
that the tribes are Aryan alone, and claim that ' five,' like seven, means ' many.'



PEOPLE AND LAND. 27
z/zy^j, 'Latin vicus, and these, again, into gramas. The names, however, are not employed with strictness, and jana, etymologically gens but politically tribus, sometimes is used as a synonym of grama} Of the ten books of the Rig-Veda seven are ascribed to various priestly families. In the main, these books are rituals of song as inculcated for the same rites by different family priests and their descendants. Besides these there are books which are ascribed to no family, and consist,
in part, of more general material. The distinction of priestly family-books was one, possibly, coextensive with political demarcation. Each of the family-books represents a priestly
family, but it may represent, also, a political family. In at
least one case it represents a political body.^
These great political groups, which, perhaps, are represented by family rituals, were essentially alike in language, custom
and religion (although minor ritualistic differences probably
obtained, as well as tribal preference for particular cults);
while in all these respects, as well as in color and other racial
peculiarities, the Aryans were distinguished from the darkskinned aborigines, with whom, until the end of the Rig Vedic period, they were perpetually at war. At the close of this period the immigrant Aryans had reduced to slavery many of their unbelieving and barbarian enemies, and formally incor
porated them into the state organization, where, as captives,
slaves, or sons of slaves, the latter formed the "fourth caste." But while admitting these slaves into the body politic, the
priestly Aryans debarred them from the religious congregation. Between the Aryans themselves there is in this period a loosely
defined distinction of classes, but no system of caste is known
before the close of the first Vedic Collection. Nevertheless, the emphasis in this statement lies strongly upon system, and

23 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
it may not be quite idle to say at the outset that] the general
caste-distinctions not only are as old as the Indo-Iranian unity (among the Persians the same division of priest, warrior and
husbandman obtains), but, in all probability, they are much
older. For so long as there is a cult, even if it be of spirits
and devils, there are priests ; and if there are chieftains there is a nobility, such as one finds among the Teutons, nay, even among the American Indians, where also is known the inevita
ble division into priests, chiefs and commons, sometimes hereditary, sometimes not. There must have been, then, from the beginning of kingship and religious service, a division among the Aryans into royalty, priests, and people, i.e., whoever were
, not acting as priests or chieftains. When the people becomes
agricultural, the difference tends to become permanent, and a caste system begins. Now, the Vedic Aryans appear in history at just the period when they are on the move south
wards into India ; but they are no irrupting host. The battles
led the warriors on, but the folk, as a folk, moved slowly, not all abandoning the country which they had gained, but settling there, and sending onwards only a part of the people. There was no fixed line of demarcation between the classes. The
king or another might act as his own priest — yet were there
priestly families. The cow-boys might fight — yet were there those of the people that were especially 'kingsmen,' rajanyas,
and these were, already, practically a class, if not a caste.
^
These natural and necessary social divisions, which in early times were anything but rigid, soon formed inviolable groups, and then the caste system was complete. In the perfected legal scheme what was usage becomes duty. The warrior may
1 Caste, at first, means ' pure,' and signifies tliat there is a moral barrier between the caste and outcast. The woTd now practically means class, even impure class. The native word means ' color,' and the first formal distinction was national, (white) Aryan and ' black-man.' The precedent class-distinctions among the Aryans themselves became fixed in course of time, and the lines between Aryans, in some regards, were drawn almost as sharply as between Aryan and slave.



PEOPLE AND LAjYD. 29
not be a public priest ; the priest may not serve as warrior or husbandman. The farmer ' people ' were the result of eliminating first the priestly, and then the fighting factors from the
whole body politic. But these castes were all Aryans, and as*^such distinguished most sharply, from a religious point of view, from the " fourth caste " ; whereas among themselves they were,
in religion, equals. But they were practically divided by inter
ests that strongly affected the development of their original
litanies. For both priest and warrior looked down on the 'people,' but priest and warrior feared' and respected each other. To these the third estate was necessary as a base of supplies, and together they guarded it from foes divine and mortal. But to each other they were necessary for wealth and
glory, respectively. So it was that even in the earliest period
the religious litany, to a great extent, is the book of worship
of a warrior-class as prepared for it by the priest. Priest and
king — these are the main factors in the making of the hymns of the Rig Veda, and the gods lauded are chiefly the gods
patronized by these classes. The third estate had its favorite
gods, but these were little regarded, and were in a state of decadence. The slaves, too, may have had their own gods, but of these nothing is known, and one can only surmise that here and there in certain traits, which seem to be un-Aryan, may lie an unacknowledged loan from the aborigines. Between the Rig Veda and the formation or completion of the next Veda, called the Atharvan, the interval appears to have been considerable,'and the inherent value of the religion incul-, cated in the latter can be estimated aright only when this is weighed together with the fact, that, as is learned from the Atharvan's own statements, j the Aryans were now advanced ' further southwards and eastwards, had discovered a new land, made new gods, and were now more permanently established, the last a factor of some moment in the religious development.
Indications of the difference in time may be seen in the

.geographical and physical limitations of the older period as 'compared with those of the later Atharvan. When first the Aryans are found in India, at the time of the Rig Veda, they are located, for the most part, near the upper Indus (Sindhu). The Ganges, mentioned but twice, is barely known. On the west the Aryans lingered in East Kabulistan (possibly in Kashmeer in the north) ; and even Kandahar appears, at least, to be known as Aryan. That is to say, the ' Hindus ' were still in Afghanistan, although the greater mass of the people had already crossed the Indus and were progressed some distance to the east of the Punjab. That the race was still migrating may be seen from the hymns of the Rig Veda itself.' Their journey was to the south-east, and both before and after they reached the Indus they left settlements, chiefly about the Indus and in the Punjab (a post-Vedic group), not in the southern
but in the northern part of this district.^ The Vedic Aryans of this first period were acquainted with the Indus, Sutlej (Qutudri), Beas (Vipag, "Y<^ao-ts), Ravi (Paru
shni or Iravati);' the pair of rivers that unite and flow into the
Indus, viz. : Jhelum (Vitasta, Behat), and Chinab (Asikni,^ Akesines) ; and knew the remoter Kubha (K-<o<t>ijv, Kabul) and the northern Suvastu (Swat) ; while they appear to have had a legendary remembrance of the Rasa, Avestan Rahha (Rangha), supposed by some to be identical with the Araxes or Yaxartes, but probably (see below) only a vague 'stream,' the old name travelling with them on their wanderings ; for one would err if
he regarded similarity or even identity of appellation as a proof of real identity.* West of the Indus the Kurum and Gomal appear to be known also. Many rivers are mentioned of which
1 Compare RV. hi. 33, and in I. 131. 5, the words: ' God Indra, thou didst help thy suppUants ; one river after another they gained who pursued glory.' 2 Thomas, J?!vers of the Vedas (JRAS. xv. 357 ff. ; Ziramer, loc: cit. cap. i). 8 Later called the Candrabhaga. For the Jumna and Sarayu see below. 4 This is the error into which falls Brunnhofer, whose theory that the Vedic Aryans were still settled near the Caspian has' been criticised above (p. 15).



PEOPLE AND LAND. 31
the names are given, but their location is not established. It is from the district west of the Indus that the most famous Sanskrit grammarian comes, and long after the Vedas an Indie people are known in the Kandahar district, while Kashmeer was a late home of culture. The Sarasvati river, the' name of
which is transferred at least once in historical times, may have been originally one with the Arghandab (on which is Kandahar), for the Persian name of this river {s becomes K) is Harahvati
(Arachotos, Arachosia), and it is possible that it was really this river, and not the Indus which was first lauded as the Saras
vati. In that case there would be a perfect parallel to what
has probably happened in the case of the Rasa, the name in both cases meaning only ' the stream ' (like Rhine, Arno,
etc.) — being transferred to a new river. But since the Iranian
Harahvati fixes the first river of this name, there is here a stronger proof of Indo-Iranian community than is furnished by other examples. "^ These facts or suggestive parallels of names are of exceeding importance. They indicate between the Vedic Aryans and the Iranians a connection much closer than usually has been assumed. The bearings of such a connection on the
religious ideas of the two peoples are self-evident, and will
often have to be touched upon in the course of this history. It is of less importance, from the present point of view, to say how the Aryans entered India, but since this question is also
connected with that of the religious environment of the first
Hindu poets, it will be well to state that, although, as some
scholars maintain, and as we believe, the Hindus may have come with the Iranians through the open pass of Herat (Haraiva, Haroyu), it is possible that they parted from the latter south of the Hindukush^ (descending through the Kohistan passes from the north), and that the two peoples thence diverged south-east
1 Compare Geiger, Ostiranische Cttliur^ p. Si. See also Muir, OST. ii. p. 355. 2 Lassen, I. p. 616, decided in favor of the western passes of the Hindukush.



32 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
and south-west respectively. Neither assumption would prevent the country lying between the Harahvati and Vitasta ^ from being, for generations, a common camping-ground for both peoples, who were united still, but gradually diverging. This seems, at-least, to be the most reasonable explanation of the fact that these two rivers are to each people their farthest known western and eastern limits respectively. With the exception of
the vague and uncertain Rasa, the Vedic Hindu's geographical knowledge is limited by Kandahar in the west, as is the Iranian's in the east by the Vitasta.^ North of the Vitasta
Mount Tricota (Trikakud, ' three peaks ') is venerated, and this together with a Mount Mujavat, of which the situation is probably in the north, is the extent of modern knowledge in respect of the natural boundaries of the Vedic people. One
hears, to be sure; at a later time, of 'northern Kurus,' whose
felicity is proverbial; and it is very tempting to find in this name a connection with the Iranian Kur, but the Kurus, like the Rasa
and Sarasvati, are re-located once (near Delhi), and no similar
ity of name can assure one of a true connection. If not coinci
dences, such likenesses are too vague to be valuable historically.' Another much disputed point must be spoken of in connection with this subject. In the Veda and in the Avesta there is mentioned the land of the ' seven rivers.' Now seven rivers are often spoken of in the Rig Veda, but only once does this term mean the country, while in the ' Hymn to the Rivers ' no
1 From Kandahar in Afghanistan to a point a little west of Lahore. In the former district, according to the Avesta, the dead are buried (an early Indian custom, not Iranian). 2 Geiger identifies the Vitaguhaiti or Vitanghvati with the Oxus, but this is improbable. It lies in the extreme east and forms the boundary between the true believers and the 'demon-worshippers ' (Yasht, 5, 77; Geiger, loc. cit. p. 131, note 5). The Persian name is the same with Vitasta, which is located in the Punjab. 8 On the Kurus compare Zimmer {loc. cit.)^ who thinks Kashmeer is meant, and Geiger, loc. cit. p. 39. Other geographical reminiscences may lie in Vedic and Brahmanic allusions to Bactria, Balkh (AV.) ; to the Derbiker (ar5und Merv ? RV.), and to Manu's mountain, whence he descended after the flood (Naubandhana) : Catapatha Brdhmana, I. 3. i, 6, ' Manu's descent ').



PEOPLE AND LAND. 33
less than twenty-one streams are enumerated (RV. X. 75). In order to make out the ' seven rivers ' scholars have made different combinations, that most in favor being Miiller's, the five rivers of the Punjab together with the Kabul and (Swat or) Saras
vati. But in point of fact ' seven ' quite as often means many, as it does an exact number, and this, the older use, may well be applied here. It is quite impossible to identify the seven, and it is probable that no Vedic poet ever imagined them to be a group of this precise number. It would be far easier to select a group of seven conspicuous riyers, if anywhere, on the west of the Indus. A very natural group from the Iranian side would be the Herirud, Hilmund, Arghandab, Kurum, Kabul, Indus, and Vitasta. Against this, however, can be urged that
the term ' seven rivers ' may be Bactrian, older than the Vedic
period ; and that, in particular, the Avesta distinguishes Vai
kerta, Urva, and other districts from the ' seven rivers.' It is best to remain uncertain in so doubtful a matter, bearing in mind that even Kurukshetra, the 'holy land,' is said to-day to be watered by ' seven streams,' although some say nine ; apropos of which fact Cunningham remarks, giving modern examples, that "the Hindus invariably assign seven branches to all their
rivers."^ Within the Punjab, the Vedic Aryans, now at last really ' Hindus,' having extended themselves to the ^utudri (Qatadru, Sutlej), a formidable barrier, and eventually having crossed
even this, the last tributary of the Indus, descended to the Jumna (Yamuna), over the little stream called ' the Rocky
'
(Drishadvati) and the lesser Sarasvati, southeast from Lahore
and near Delhi, in the region Kurukshetra, afterwards famed as
the seat of the great epic war, and always regarded as holy in
the highest degree. Not till the time of the Atharva Veda do the Aryans appear
as far east as Benares (Varanasi, on the 'Varanavati'?), though
^ Arch. Survey^ y.iv. p. 89 ; Thomas, loc, cit, p. 363.



34 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the Sarayu is mentioned in the Rik. But this scarcely is the tributary of the Ganges, Gogra, for the name seems to refer to a more western stream, since it is associated with the Gomati (Gomal). One may surmise that in the time of the Rig Veda the Aryans knew only by name the country east of Lucknow. It is in the Punjab and a little to the west ^nd east of it|(how
far it is impossible to state with accuracy) where lies the real
theatre of activity of the Rig Vedic people. Some scholars believe that this people had already heard of the two oceans. This point again is doubtful in the extreme. No descriptions imply a knowledge of ocean, and the word for ocean means merely a ' confluence ' of waters, or in general a great oceanic body of water like the air. As the Indus is too wide to be seen across, the name may apply in most cases to this
river. An allusion to ' eastern and western floods,' -^ which is held by some to be conclusive evidence for a knowledge of the
two seas, is taken by others to apply to the air-oceans. The
expression may apply simply to rivers, for it is said that the Vipag and Qutudri empty into the 'ocean', i.e., the Indus or the Q^utudri's continuation.^ One late verse alone speaks of the Sarasvati pouring into the ocean, and this would indicate the Arabian Sea.^ Whether the Bay of Bengal was known, even by hearsay and in the latest time of this period, remains uncertain. As a body the Aryans of the Rig Veda were certainly not acquainted with either ocean. Some straggling adventurers probably pushed down the Indus, but Zimmer
doubtless is correct in asserting that the popular emigration did not extend further south than the junction of the Indus and the Pancanada (the united five rivers).* The extreme south-eastern geographical limit of the Rig Vedic people may

be reckoned (not, however, in Oldenberg's opinion, with any great certainty) as being in Northern Behar (Magadha). The great desert, Marusthala, formed an impassable southern obstacle for the first immigrants.^ On the other hand, tlie two oceans are well known to the Atharva Veda, while the geographical (and hence chronological) difference between the Rik and the Atharvan is furthermore illustrated by the following facts : in the Rig Veda wolf and lion are the most formidable beasts ; the tiger is unknown and the elephant seldom alluded to ; while in the Atharvan the tiger has taken the lion's place and the elephant is a more familiar figure. Now the tiger has his domicile in the swampy land about Benares, to which point is come the Atharvan Aryan, but not the Rig Vedic people. Here too, in the Atharvan, the panther is first mentioned, and for the first time silver and iron are certainly referred to. In the Rig Veda the metals are bronze and gold, silver and iron being unknown.^ Not less sig
nificant are the trees. The ficus religiosa, the tree later called
the 'tree of the gods' {cieva-sadana, a(vattha), under which
are fabled to sit the divinities in heaven, is scarcely known in the Rig Veda, but is well known in the Atharvan ; while
India's grandest tree, the nyagrodha, ficus indica, is known to the Atharvan and Brahmanic period, but is utterly foreign to
the Rig Veda. Zimmer deems it no less significant that fishes are spoken of in the Atharvan and are mentioned only once in the Rig Veda, but this may indicate a geographical difference less than one of custom. In only one doubtful passage is the north-east monsoon alluded to. The storm so vividly described in the Rig Veda is the south-west monsoon which is felt in the
northern Punjab. The north-east monsoon is felt to the south

east of the Punjab, possibly another indication of geographical
extension, withal within the limits of the Rig Veda itself. The seat of culture shifts in the Brahmanic period, which follows that of the Vedic poems, and is found partly in the ' holy land ' of the west, and partly in the east (Behar, Tirhut).i The literature of this period comes from Aryans that have passed out of the Punjab. Probably, as we have said, settle
ments were left all along the line of progress. Even before the wider knowledge of the post-Alexandrine imperial age (at which time there wasi a north-western military retrogression),
and, from the Vedic point of view, as late as the end of the Brahmanic period, in the time of the Upanishads, the northwest seems still to have been familiarly known.

CHAPTER III.
THE RIG VEDA. THE UPPER GODS.
The hymns of the Rig Veda may be divided into three classes, those in which are especially lauded the older divinities, those in which appear as most prominent the sacrificial gods, and those in which a long-weakened polytheism is giving place to the light of a clearer pantheism. In each category
there are hymns of different age. and quality, for neither did the more ancient with the growth of new divinities cease to be revered, nor did pantheism inhibit the formal acknowledgment of the primitive pantheon. The cult once established persisted, and even when, at a later time, all the gods had been reduced
to nominal fractions of the All-god, their ritualistic individuality still was preserved. The chief reason for this lies in the nature of these gods and in the attitude of the worshipper. No matter how much the cult of later gods might prevail, the other gods, who represented the daily phenomena of nature, were still visible, awe-inspiring, divine. The firmest pantheist
questioned not the advisability of propitiating the sun-god, however much he might regard this god as but a part of one that was greater. Belief in India was never so philosophical
that the believer did not dread the lightning, and seek to avert
it by praying to the special god that wielded it. But active veneration in later times was extended in fact only to the strong Powers, while the more passive divinities, although they were kept as a matter of form in the ceremonial, yet had in reality only tongue-worshippers. With some few exceptions, however, it will be found impossible to say whether any one deity belonged to the first pantheon.



38 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The best one can do is to separate the mass of gods from those that become the popular gods, and endeavor to learn what was the character of each, and what were the conceptions of the poets in regard both to his nature, and to his relations with man. A different grouping of the gods (that indicated below)
will be followed, therefore, in our exposition. After what has been said in the introductory chapter con
cerning the necessity of distinguishing between good and bad poetry, it may be regarded as incumbent upon us to seek to make such a division of the hymns as shall illustrate our words.
But we shall not attempt to do this here, because the distinction between late mechanical and poetic hymns is either very evident, and it would be superfluous to burden the pages with the trash contained in the former,^ or the distinction is one
liable to reversion at the hands of those critics whose judgment
differs from ours, for there are of course some hymns that to
one may seem poetical and to another, artificial. Moreover, we admit that hymns of true feeling may be composed late
as well as early, while as to beauty of style the chances are
that the best literary production will be found among the latest
rather than among the earliest hymns. It would, indeed, be admissible, if one had any certainty in regard to the age of the different parts of the Rig Veda, simply to divide the hymns into early, middle, and late, as they are sometimes divided in philological works, but here one rests on
the weakest of all supports for historical judgment, a linguistic and metrical basis, when one is ignorant alike of what may have
been accomplished by imitation, and of the work of those later priests who remade the poems of their ancestors. Best then, because least hazardous, appears to be the method which we have followed, namely, to take up group by group
1 Such for instance as the hymn to the Agvins, RV. ii. 39. Compare verses 3-4 :
' Come (ye pair of Agvins) like two horns ; like two hoofs ; Uke two geese ; like two
wheels ; Uke two ships ; like two spans ' ; etc. This is the content of the whole hymn.



THE RIG VEDA. THE UPPER GODS. 39
the most important deities arranged in the order of their relative importance, and by studying each to arrive at a fair understanding of the pantheon as a whole. The Hindus themselves divided their gods into highest, middle, and lowest, or those of the upper sky, the atmosphere, and the earth. This division, from the point of view of one who would enter into the spirit of the seers and at the same time keep in mind the changes to
which that spirit gradually was subjected, is an excellent one. For, as will be seen, although the earlier order of regard may have been from below upwards, this order does not apply to the literary monuments. These show on the contrary a worship which steadily tends from above earthwards ; and the three periods into which may be divided all Vedic theology are first that of the special worship of sky-gods, when less attention is paid to -others ; then that of the atmospheric and
meteorological divinities ; and finally that of terrestrial powers,
each later group absorbing, so to speak, the earlier, and therewith preparing the developing Hindu intelligence for the reception of the universal god with whom closes the series. Other factors than those of an inward development undoubtedly were at work in the formation of this growth. Especially prominent is the amalgamation of the gods of the lower classes with those of the priest-hood. Climatic environment, too, conditioned theological evolution, if not spiritual advance. The
cult of the mid-sphere god, Indra, was partly the result of the changing atmospheric surroundings of the Hindus as they advanced into India. The storms and the sun were not those of old. The tempests were more terrific, the displayofUlvine power was more concentrated in the rage of the elements ; while appreciation of the goodness of. the sun became tinged with apprehension of evil, and he became a deadly power as well as
one beneficent . Then the relief of rain after drought gave to
Indra the character of a benign god as well as of a fearful one.
Nor were lacking in the social condition certain alterations



40 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
which worked together with climatic changes. The segregated mass of the original people, the braves that hung about the king, a warrior-class rapidly becoming a caste, and politically the most important caste, took the god of thunder and lightning for their god of battle. The fighting race naturally exalted to
the highest the fighting god. Then came into prominence the priestly caste, which gradually taught the warrior that mind was stronger than muscle. But this caste was one of thinkers. Their divinity was the product of reflection. Indra remained, but yielded to a higher power, and the god thought 'out by the priests became God. Yet it must not be supposed that the cogitative energy of the Brahman descended upon the people's gods and suddenly produced a religious revolution. In India
no intellectual advance is made suddenly. The older divinities show one by one the transformation that they suffered at the hands of theosophic thinkers. Before the establishment
of a general Father-god, and long before that of the pantheistic All-god, the philosophical leaven was actively at work. Itvwill
be seen operative at once in the case of the sun-god, and, indeed, there were few of the older divinities that were un
touched by it. It worked silently and at first esoterically.
One reads of the gods' ' secret names,' of secrets in theology,
which ' are not to be revealed,' till at last the disguise is with
drawn, and it is discovered that all the mystery of former generations has been leading up to the declaration now made pubHc : 'all these gods are but names of the One.'
THE SUN-GOD.
The hymn which was translated in the first chapter gives an epitome of the simpler conceptions voiced in the few whole hymns to the jun. But there is a lower and a higher view of
this god. He is the shining god par excellence, the deva, stirya^
1 Daia is ' shining' (deus), and Surya (sol, ijXios) means the same.



THE SUN-GOD. 41
the red ball in the sky. But he is also an active force, the
power that wakens, rouses, enlivens, and as such it is he that gives all good things to mortals and to gods. As the god that gives life h e (with others) -^ is the author of birth, and is prayed
to for children. From above he looks down upon earth, and as with his one or many steeds he drives over the firmament he observes all that is passing below. He has these, the physical side and the spiritual side, under two names, the glowing one,
SCirya, and the enlivener, Savitar;^ but he is also the good god who bestows benefits, and as such he was known, probably locally, by the name of Bliaga. Again, as a herdsman's god,
possibly at first also a local deity, he is Pushan (the meaning is almost the same with that of Savitar). As the ' mighty one ' he is Vishnu, who measures heaven in three strides. In general, the conception of the sun as a physical phenomenon will be found voiced chiefly in the family-books : " The sightly form rises on the- slope of the sky as the swift-going steed carries him . . . seven sister steeds carry him." " This is the prevailing utterance. Sometimes the sun is depicted under a medley of metaphors : " A bull, a flood, a red bird, he has
entered his father's place ; a variegated stone he is set in the midst of the sky ; he has advanced and guards the two ends of space." * One after the other the god appears to the poets as
a bull, a bird,^ a steed, a stone, a jewel, a flood, a torch-holder,° or as a gleaming car set in heaven. Nor is the sun indepen
dent. As in the last image of a chariot,' so, without symbolism,
the poet speaks of the sun as made to rise by Varuna and Mitra : " On their wonted path go Varuna and Mitra when in

the sky they cause to rise Surya, whom they made to avert darkness"; where, also, the sun, under another image, is the
" support of tlie sky." ^ Nay, in this simpler view, the sun is no more than the •" eye of Mitra Varuna," ^ a conception formally retained even when the sun in the same breath is spoken of as pursuing Dawn like a lover, and as being the ' soul of the universe' (I. 115. 1-2). In the older passages the later moral element is almost lacking, nor is there maintained the
same physical relation between Sun and Dawn. In the earlier hymns the Dawn is the Sun's mother, from whom he proceeds.^ It is the "Dawns produced the Sun," in still more natural language ;
'^ whereas, the idea of the lover-Sun following the
Dawn scarcely occurs in the family-books.^ Distinctly late,
also, is the identification of the sun with the all-spirit (atrnd,
I. 115. i), and the following prayer: "Remove, O sun, all weakness, illness, and bad dreams." In this hymn, X. 37. 14, Surya is the son of the sky, but he is evidently one with Savitar, who in V. 82. 4, removes bad dreams, as in X. 100. 8, he removes sickness. Men are rendered ' sinless ' by the sun
(IV. 54. 3 ; X. 37. 9) exactly as they are by the other gods, Indra, Varuna, etc. In a passage that refers to the important
triad of sun, wind and fire, X. 158. i ff., the sun is invoked to 'save from the sky,' i.e., from all evils that may come from the upper regions ; while in the same book the sun, like Indra, is represented as the slayer of demons (asuras) and dragons ; as
the slayer, also, of the poet's rivals ; as giving long life to the worshipper, and as himself drinking sweet sovta. This is one of the poems that seem to be at once late and of a forced and
artificial character (X. 170).

THE SUN-GOD. 43
Although Surya is differentiated explicitly from Savitar
(V. 8i. 4, "Savitar, thou joyest in Surya's rays"), yet do many of the hymns make no distinction between them. The Enlivener is naturally extolled in fitting phrase, to tally with his title
:
"The shining-god, the Enlivener, is ascended to enliven the
world " ; " He gives protection, wealth and children " (II. 38. i
;
IV. 53. 6-7). The later hymns seem, as one might expect, to show greater confusion between the attributes of the physical and spiritual sun. But what higher power under either name is ascribed to the sun in the later hymns is not due to a higher or more developed homage of the sun as such. On the contrary, as with many other deities, the more the praise the less the individual worship. It is as something more than the
sun that the god later receives more fulsome devotion. And, in fact, paradoxical as it seems, it is a decline in sun-worship
proper that is here registered. The altar-fire becomes more important, and is revered in the sun, whose hymns, at most, are few, and in part mechanical. Bergaigne in his great work. La Religion Vedique, has laid much stress on sexual antithesis as an element in Vedic worship. It seems to us that' this has been much exaggerated. The sun is masculine ; the dawn, feminine. But there is no
indication of a primitive antithesis of male and female in their relations. What occurs appears to be of adventitious character. For though sun and dawn are often connected, the latter is represented first as his mother and afterwards as his ' wife ' or mistress. Even in the later hymns, where the marital
relation is recognized, it is not insisted upon. But Bergaigne ^
is right in saying that in the Rig Veda the sun does not play
the part of an evil power, and it is a good illustration of the difference between Rik and Atharvan, when Ehni cites, to prove that the sun is like death, only passages from the Athar
van and the later Brahmanic literature.^

44 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
When, later, the Hindus got into a region where the sun was deadly, they said, "Yon burning sun-god is death," but in the Rig Veda they said, " Yon sun is the source of life," ^ and no other conception of the sun is to be found in the Rig Veda. There are about a dozen hymns to Surya, and as many to Savitar, in the Rig Veda.'' It is noteworthy that in the familybooks the hymns to Savitar largely prevail, while those to
Surya are chiefly late in position or content. Thus, in the family-books, where are found eight or nine of the dozen
hymns to Savitar, there are to Surya but three or four, and of these the first is really to Savitar and the Agvins ; the second
is an imitation of the first ; the third appears to be late ; and the fourth is a fragment of somewhat doubtful antiquity. The
first runs as follows : " The altar-fire has seen well-pleased the dawns' beginning and the offering to the gleaming ones ; come, O ye horsemen (Agvins), to the house of the pious man ; the
sun (Surya), the shining-god, rises with light. The shining-god Savitar has elevated his beams, swinging his banner like a good (hero) raiding for cattle. According to rule go Varuna and Mitra when they make rise in the sky the sun (Surya) whom they have created to dissipate darkness, being (gods) sure of their habitation and unswerving in intent. Seven yellow swiftsteeds bear this Surya, the seer of .all that moves. Thou comest with swiftest steeds unspinning the web, separating, O shining-god, the black robe. The rays of Surya swinging
(his banner) have laid darkness like a skin in the waters. Unconnected, unsupported, downward extending, why does not this (god) fall down.' With what nature goes he, who
knows (literally, ' who has seen ') ? As a support he touches and guards the vault of the sky" (IV. 13).
There is here, no more than in the early hymn from the first
book, translated in the first chapter, any worship of material
1 RV., IV. 54. 2. Here the sun gives life even to tlie gods.
2 Ten liundred and twenty-eiglit hymns are contained in the ' Rig Veda Collection.'



THE SUN-GOD. 45
phenomena. Surya is worshipped as Savitar, either expressly
so called, or with all the attributes of the spiritual. The hymn
that follows this ^ is a bald imitation. In V. 47 there are
more or less certain signs of lateness, e.g., in the fourth stanza
("four carry him, . . . and ten give the child to drink that he may go," etc.) there is the juggling with unexplained numbers,
which is the delight of the later priesthood. Moreover, this hymn is addressed formally to Mitra-Varuna and Agni, and not to the sun-god, who is mentioned only in metaphor ; while the final words ndtno dive, ' obeisance to heaven,' show that the sun is only indirectly addressed. One cannot regard hymns addressed to Mitra-Varuna and Surya (with other gods) as primarily intended for Surya, who in these hymns is looked upon as the subject of Mitra and Varuna, as in vii. 62 ; or as the "eye " of the two other gods, and 'like Savitar' in vii. 63. So in vii. 66. 14-16, a mere fragment of a hymn is devoted exclusively to Surya as "lord of all that stands and goes." But in these hymns there are some very interesting touches. Thus in vii. 60. i, the sun does not make sinless, but he announces to Mitra and Varuna that the mortal is sinless. There are no other hymns than these addressed to Surya, save those in the first and tenth books, of which nine stanzas of
I. 50 (see above) may be reckoned early, while I. 115, where the sun is the soul of the universe, and at the same time the
eye of Mitra-Varuna, is probably late; and I. 163 is certainly so, wherein the sun is identified with Yama, Trita, etc. ; is ' like Varuna ' ; and is himself a steed, described as having three
connections in the sky, three in the waters, three in the sea. In one of the hymns in the tenth book, also a mygtical song,
the sun is the ' bird ' of the sky, a metaphor which soon gives another figure to the pantheon in the form of Garutman, the sun-bird, of whose exploits are told strange tales in the epic, where he survives as Garuda. In other hymns Surya averts

46 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
carelessness at the sacrifice, guards tlie worshipper, and slays demons. A mechanical little hymn describes him as measuring the ' thirty stations.' Not one of these hymns has literary freshness or beauty of any kind. They all belong to the class
of stereotyped productions, which differ in origin and content
from the hymns first mentioned.''^
SAVITAR.
Turning to Savitar one finds, of course, many of the same
descriptive traits as in the praise of Surya, his more material self. But with the_Jncreased spirituality come new features.
Savitar is not alone the sun that rises ; he is also the sun thaft i
sejs ; and is extolled as such. There are other indications that most of the hymns composed for him are to accompany the sacrifice, either of the morning or of the evening. In II.
38, an evening song to Savitar, there are inner signs that the
hymn was made for rubrication, but here some fine verses occur: "The god extends his vast hand, his arms above there

and all here obeys him; to his command the waters move, and even the winds' blowing ceases on all sides." Again : "Neither Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, Rudra, nor the demons, impair his law." We call attention here to the fact ^that the Rig Veda contains a stong current of demonology^ much stronger than has been pointed out by scholars intent on proving the primitive loftiness of the Vedic religion.
In III. 62. 7-9 there are some verses to Pushan, following which is the most holy couplet of the Rig Veda, to repeat which is essentially to repeat the Veda. It is the famous Gayatri or Savitri hymnlet (10-12):
Of Savitar, the heavenly, that longed-for glory may we win, And may himself inspire our prayers.''
^ X. 37; 158; 170; 177; 189. Each has its own mark of lateness. In 37, the dream; in 158, the triad; in 170, the sun as asuralia ; in 177, the mystic tone and the bird-sun (compare Garutnian, I. 164 ; X. 149) ; in 189, the thirty stations. 2 See Whitney in Colebrookc's Essays, revised edition, ii. p. iii.



SA VITAX. 47
Whitney (Joe. cif.) says of this hymn that it is not remarkable in any way and that no good reason lias ever been given for its fame. The good reason for this fame, in our opinion, is that
the longed-for glory was interpreted later' as a revealed indication of primitive pantheism, and the verses were understood to express the desire of absorption into the sun, which, as will be seen, was one of the first divine bodies to be accepted as the
type of the All-god. This is also the intent of the stanzas added to I. 50 (above, p. 17), where Surya is "the highest light, the god among gods," mystic words, taken by later philosophers, and quite rightly, to be an expression of pantheism. The esoteric meaning of the Gayatri presumably made it popular among the enlightened. Exoterically the sun was
only the goal of the soul, or, in pure pantheisrri, of the sight.
In the following the sin-forgiving side of Savitar is developed, whereby he comes into connection with Varuna :
God Savitar deserveth now a song from us
;
To-day, with guiding word, let men direct him here. He who distributes gifts unto the sons of men, Shall here on us bestow whatever thing is best
;
For thou, O Savitar, dost first upon the gods Who sacrifice deserve, lay immortality. The highest gift, and then to mortals dost extend As their apportionment a long enduring life. Whatever thoughtless thing against the race of gods We do in foolishness and human insolence. Do thou from that, O Savitar, mid gods and men Make us here sinless, etc.
But if this song smacks of the sacrifice, still more so does
V. 81, where Savitar is the 'priest's priest,' the 'arranger of sacrifice,' and is one with Pushan. He is here the swift horse (see above) and rnore famous as the divider of time than any
thing else. In fact this was the first ritualistic glory of Savitar,
that he divides the time for sacrifice. But he receives more in

48 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the light of being the type of other luminous divinities. In the next hymn, another late effort (v. 82 ; see the dream in vs. 4), there may be an imitation of the Gayatri. Savitg.r is here the All-god and* true lord, and frees from sin. There is
nothing new or striking in the hymns vi. 71 ; vii. 38 and 45. The same golden hands, and references to the sacrifice occur here. Allusions to the Dragon of the Deep, who is called
upon with Savitar (vii. 38. 5), and the identification of Savitar
with Bhaga (ib. 6) are the most important items to be gleaned
from these rather stupid hymns. In other hymns not in the
family-books (ii.-viii.), there is a fragment, X. 139. 1-3, and
another, I. 22. 5-8. In the latter, Agni's (Fire's) title, 'son
of waters,' is given to Savitar, who is virtually identified with
Agni in the last part of the Rig Veda ; and in the former
hymn there is an interesting discrimination made between Savitar and Pushan, who obeys him. The last hymn in the
collection to Savitar, X. 149, although late and plainly intended
for the sacrifice (vs. 5), is interesting as showing how the philosophical speculation worked about Savitar as a centre. ' He
alone, he the son of the waters, knows the origin of water,
whence arose the world.' This is one of the early speculations which recur so frequently in the Brahmanic period, wherein the origin of ' all this ' (the universe) is referred to water. A
hymn to Savitar in the first book contains as excellent a song as is given to the sun under this name. It is neither a morn
ing nor an evening song in its original state, but mentions all the god's functions, without the later moral traits so prominent
elsewhere, arid with the old threefold division instead of thricethree heavens.
TO SAVITAR (I. 35).
I call on Agni first (the god of fire) for weal
;
I call on Mitra-Varuna to aid me here
;
I call upon the Night, who quiets all that moves;
On Savitar, the shining god, I call for help.



SA VITAR. 49
After this introductory invocation begins the real song in a different metre.

Who puts to rest th' immortal and the mortal, On golden car existent things beholding, The god that rouses, Savitar, the shining

1 Two 'laps' below, besides that above, the word meaning 'middle' but also ' under-place.' The explanation of this much-disputed passage will be found by comparing i. 154. 5 and vii. 99. i. The sun's three places are where he appears on both horizons and in the zenith. The last is the abode of the dead where Yama reigns. Compare iv. 53. The bracketed verses are probably a late puzzle attached to the word ' lap ' of the preceding verse. 2 Doubtful. 3 The Spirit, later of evil spirits, demons (as above, the asuraha).

PUSHAN AND BHAGA AS SUN-GODS.
With Pushan, the 'bestower of prosperity,' appears an ancient side of sun-worship. While under his other names the sun has
lost, to a great extent, the attributes of a bucolic solar deity, in
the case of Pushan he appears still as a god whose characteris
tics are bucolic, war-like, and priestly, that is to say, even as
he is venerated by the three masses of the folk. It will not do, of course, to distinguish too sharply between the first two
divisions, but one can very well compare Pushan in these roles with Helios guiding his herds, and Apollo swaying armed hosts. It is customary to regard Pushan as too bucolic a deity, but this is only one side of him. He apparently is the sun, as
herdsmen look upon him, and in this figure is the object of ridicule with the warrior-class who, especially in one family or tribe, take a more exalted view of him. Consequently, as in the case of Varuna, one need not read into the hymns more
than they offer to see that, not to speak of the priestly view, there are at least two Pushans, in the Rig Veda itself.^ As the god 'with braided hair,' and as the 'guardian of
cattle,' Piishan offers, perhaps, in these particulars, the original
of Rudra's characteristics, who, in the "Vedic period, and later as Rudra-Qiva, is also a ' guardian of cattle ' and has the ' braided hair.'
Bergaigne identifies Pushan with Soma, with whom the poets were apt to identify many other deities, but there seems to be
little similarity originally.^ It is only in the wider circles of

PUSHAN AND BHAGA AS SUN-GODS. 51
each god's activity that the two approach each other. Both gods, it is true, wed Surya (the female sun-power), and Soma,
like Pushan, finds lost cattle. But it must be recognized once
for all that identical attributes are not enough to identify Vedic gods. Who gives wealth ? Indra, Soma, Agni, Heaven and Earth, Win'd, Sun, the Maruts, etc. Who forgives sins ? Agni, Varuna, Indra, the Sun, etc. Who helps in war? Agni, Pushan, Indra, Soma, etc. Who sends rain ? Indra, Parjanya, Soma, the Maruts, Pushan, etc. Who weds Dawn ? The
Agvins, the Sun, etc. The attributes must be functional or
the identification is left incomplete.
The great disparity in descriptions of Pushan may be illus
trated by setting vi. 48. 19 beside x. 92. 13. The former passage merely declares that Pushan is a war-leader " over mortals, and like the gods in glory"; the latter, that he is " distinguished by all divine attributes " ; that is to say, what has happened in the case of Savitar has happened here also. The individuality of Pushan dies out, but the vaguer he becomes the more grandiloquently is he praised and associated with other powers ; while for lack of definite laudation general glory is ascribed to him. The true' position of Pushan
in the eyes of the warrior is given unintentionally by one who says,^ " I do not scorn thee, O Pushan," i.e., as do most people, on account of thy ridiculous attributes. For Pushan does not drink soma like Indra, but eats mush. So another devout believer says : " Pushan is not described by them that call him an eater of mush." ^ The fact that he was so called speaks louder than the pious protest. Again, Pushan is simply bucolic. He uses the goad, which, however, according to Bergaigne, is the thunderbolt ! So, too, the cows that Pushan is described as guiding have been interpreted as clouds or 'dawns.' But they may be taken without 'interpretation' as
1 i. 1 38. 4.

S2 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
real cows.* Pushan drives the cows, he is armed with a goad, and eats mush ; bucolic throughout, yet a sun-god. It is on
these lines that his finding-qualities are to be interpreted. He finds lost cattle,^ a proper business for such a god ; but Bergaigne will see in this a transfer from Pushan's finding of rain and of soma? Pushan, too, directs the furrow.^ Together with Vishnu and Bhaga this god is invoked at
sacrifices, (a fact that says little against or for his original sunship),^ and he is intimately connected with Indra. His sister is his mistress, and his mother is his wife (Dawn and Night ?) according to the meagre accounts given in vi. 55. 4-5." As a
god of increase he is invoked in the marriage-rite, X. 85. 37. As Savitar and all sun-gods are at once luminous and dark, so Pushan has a clear and again a revered (terrible) appear
ance ; he is like day and night, like Dyaus (the sky) ; at one
time bright, at another, plunged in darkness, vi. 58. i. Quite like Savitar he is the shining god who " looks upon all beings
and sees them all together " ; he is the " lord of the path," the
god of travellers ; he is invoked to drive away evil spirits,
thieves, footpads, and all workers of evil ; he makes paths for the winning of wealth ; he herds the stars and directs all with so}na. He carries a golden axe or sword, and is borne through air and water on golden ships ; and it is he that lets down the sun's golden wheel. These simpler attributes appear for the most part in the early hymns. In what seem to be later hymns, he is the mighty one who " carries the thoughts of all " ; he is
1 In i. 23. 13-15 Pushan is said to bring king (soma), " wliom lie found like a lost herd of cattle." The fragment is late if, as is probable, the ' six' of vs. 15 are the six seasons. Compare vi. 54. 5, " may Pushan go after our kine." 2 Compare vi. 54. 3 He is the' ' son of freeing,' from darkness ? vi. 55. i. 4 iv. 57. 7.
5 vi. 17. 11; 48, II ff.; iv. 30. 24 S. He is called like a war-god with the

PUSHAN AND BHAGA AS SUN-GODS. 53
like soma (the drink), and attends to tlie filter ; he is " lord of
the pure " ; the " one born of old," and is especially called upon to help the poets' hymns.' It is here, in the last part of the Rig Veda, that he appears as i/fv^oiro/xTro's, who "goes and returns," escorting the souls of the dead to heaven. He is
the sun's messenger, and is differentiated from Savitar in X.
139. \? Apparently he was a god affected most by the
Bharadvaja family (to which is ascribed the sixth book of the Rig Veda) where his worship was extended more broadly. He seems to have become the special war-god of this family, and is consequently invoked with Indra and the Maruts (though this may have been merely in his role as sun). The goats, his steeds, are also an attribute of the Scandinavian
war-god Thor (Kaegi, Rig Veda, note 2 1 o), so that his bucolic
character rests more in his goad, food, and plough. Bhaga is recognized as an Aditya (luminous deity) and was
perhaps a sun-god of some class, possibly of all, as the name
in Slavic is still kept in the meaning ' god,' literally ' giver.' In the Rig Veda the word means, also, simply god, as in bhagabhakta, ' given by gods ' ; but as a name it is well known,
and when thus called Bhaga is still the giver, ' the bestower
'
{vidharta). As bhaga is also an epithet of Savi'tar, the name
may not stand for an originally distinct personality. Bhaga has but one hymn.'' There is in fact no reason why Bhaga should be regarded as a sun-god, except for the formal identifi
1 Contrast I. 42, and X. 26 (with i. 13S. i). In the first hymn Pushan leads the way and drives away danger, wolves, thieves, and helps to booty and pasturage. In the last he is a war-god, who helps in battle, a 'far-ruler,' embracing the thoughts of all (as in III. 62. 9). 2 For the traits just cited compare iv. 57. 7 ; vi. 17. 11 ; 48. 15 ; 53 ; 55 ; 56. 1-3 ; 57- 3-4; 58- 2-4; II- 40; X. 17. 3 if.; 26. 3-8; I. 23. 14; all of I. 42, and 138; viii. 4. 15-18 ; III. 57.-2. In X. 17. 4, Savitar, too, guides the souls of the dead. s That is to say, one hymn is addressed to Bhaga with various other gods, vii. 41. Here he seems to be personified good-luck (" of whom even the king says, ' I would have thee,'" vs. 2). In the Brahmanas 'Bhaga is blind,' which applies better to Fortune than to the Sun.

Let one observe how unsupported is the assumption of the ritualists as applied to this hymn, that it must have been " composed for rubrication." 2 After Muir, V. p. 178. The clouds and cattleare both called ^aj, 'wanderers,' which helped in the poetic identification of the two.



PUSHAN AND BHAGA AS SUN-GODS. H
This Stanza has been prefixed to the hymn by virtue of the catch-word ' early ' (in the morning), with which really begins this prosaic poem (in different metre)
:
The early-conquering mighty Bhaga call we, The son of Boundlessness, the gift-bestower,i Whom weak and strong, and e'en the king, regarding, Cry bAdgam Shakshi, 'give to me the giver.'
^
O Bhaga, leader Bhaga, true bestower, O Bhaga, help this prayer, to us give (riches), O Bhaga, make us grow in kine and horses, O Bhaga, eke in men, men-wealthy be we

And now may we be rich, be bhaga-\io\A.&x&? Both at the (day's) approach, and eke at midday. And at the sun's departure, generous giver. The favor of the gods may we abide in.

May dawns approach the sacrifice, the holy Place, like to Dadhikra,^ like horses active, Which bring a chariot near ; so, leading Bhaga, Who finds good things, may they approach, and bring him.
As this is the only hymn addressed to Bhaga, and as it
proves itself to have been made for altar service (in style as
well as in special mention of the ceremony), it is evident that Bhaga, although called Aditi's son, is but a god of wealth and (like Anga, the Apportioner) very remotely connected with

physical functions. But the hymn appears to be so late that it cannot throw inuch light on the original conception of the deity. We rather incline to doubt whether Bhaga was ever, strictly speaking, a sun-god, and think that he was made so merely because the sun (Savitar) was called bhaga. A (Zeus) Bagaios was worshipped by the Phrygians, while in the Avesta and as a Slavic god Bhaga has no especial connettion with the sun. It must be acknowledged, however, that every form of
the sun-god is especially lauded for generosity.
VISHNU.
In the person of Vishnu the sun is extolled under another name, which in the period of the Rig Veda was still in the dawn of its glory. The hymns to Vishnu are few ; his fame rests chiefly on the three strides with which he crosses heaven,
on his making fast the earth, and on his munificence.'' - He,
too, leads in battle and is reveled under the title Qipivishta,^
of unknown significance, but meaning literally 'bald.' Like
Savitar he has three spaces, two called earthly, and one, the
highest, known only to himself. His greatness is inconceivable, and he is especially praised with Indra, the two being
looked upon as masters of the world. ^ His highest place is the realm of the departed spirits.* The hymns to him appear
to be late (thus I. 155. 6, where, as the year, he has four seasons of ninety days each). Like Pushan (his neighbor in many lauds) he is associated in a late hymn with the Maruts
(V. 87). His later popularity lies in the importance of his
' highest place ' (or step) being the home of the departed
spirits, where he himself dwells, inscrutable. This led to the
spirit's union with the sun, which, as we have said, is one of

the first phases of the pantheistic doctrine. In the familybooks Vishnu gets but two hymns, both in the same collection, and shares one more with Indra (vii. 99-100 ; vi. 69). In
some of the family-collections, notably in that of the Vi^va
mitras, he is, if not unknown, almost ignored. As Indra's friend he is most popular with the Kanva family, but even here he has no special hymn.
None born, God Vishnu, and none born hereafter E'er reaches to the limit of thy greatness
;
'Twas thou establish'st yon high vault of heaven, Thou madest fast the earth's extremest mountain, (vii. 99. 2.)
Three steps he made, the herdsman sure, Vishnu, and stepped across (the world). (I. 22. 18.)
The mighty deeds vi'ill I proclaim of Vishnu, Who measured out the earth's extremest spaces. And fastened firm the highest habitation. Thrice stepping out with step all-powerful.
O would that I might reach his path beloved, Where joy the men who hold the gods in honor. (I. 154. i, 5.)
Under all these names and images the sun is worshipped. And it is necessary to review them all to see how deeply the worship is ingrained. The sun is one of the most venerable as he is the most enduring of India's nature-gods.^ In no early passage is the sun a malignant god. He comes " as kine
tcTthe vTilage, as a hero to his steed, as a calf to the cow, as a
husband to his wife." ^ He is the 'giver,' the 'generous one,'
and as such he is Mitra, 'the friend,' who with Varuna, the encompassing heaven, is, indeed, in the Rig Veda, a personality
subordinated to his greater comrade ; yet is this, perhaps, the sun's oldest name of those that are not descriptive of purely
physical characteristics. For Mithra in Persian keeps the

proof that this title was given to the Indo-Iranic god before the separation of the two peoples. It is therefore (perliaps with Bhaga?) one of the most ancient personal designations of
the sun, — one, perhaps, developed from a mere name into
a separate deity.
HEAVEN AND EARTH.
Not only as identical with the chief god of the Greeks, but also from a native Indie point of view, it might have been expected that Dyaus (Zeus), the 'shining sky,' would play an important role in the Hindu pantheon. But such is not the case. There is not a single hymn addressed independently to Dyaus, nor is there any hint of especial preeminence of Dyaus in the half-dozen hymns that are sung to Heaven and Earth
together. The word dyaus is used hundreds of times, but gen
erally in the meaning sky (without personification). There is, to be sure, a formal acknowledgment of the fatherhood of
Dyaus (among gods he is father particularly of Dawn, the Agvins, and Indra), as there is of the motherhood of Earth,
but there is no further exaltation. No exaggeration — the
sign of Hindu enthusiasm —^is displayed in the laudation, and the epithet ' father ' is given to half a dozen Vedic gods, as in
Rome Ma(r)spiter stands beside Jup(p)iter. Certain functions are ascribed to Heaven and Earth, but they are of secondary
origin. Thus they bring to the gods the sacrifice,^ as does Agni, and one whole hymn may thus be epitomized : ' By the ordinance of Varuna made firm, O Heaven and Earth, give us blessings. Blest with children and wealth is he that adores you twain. Give us sweet food, glory and strength of heroes, ye who are our father and mother.' ''
The praise is vague and the benevolence is the usual ' bestowal of blessings ' expected of all the gods in return for
1 II. 41. 20. 2 vi. 70.



HEAVEN AND EARTH. 59
praise. Other hymns add to this something, from which one
sees that these deities are not regarded as self-created; for the seers of old, or, according to one poet, some wonderful divine artisan, " most wondrous worker of the wonder-working gods," created them. Their chief office is to exercise benign pro
tection and bestow wealth. Once they are invited to come to the sacrifice " with the gods," but this, of course, is not meant
to exclude them from the list of gods."^
The antithesis of male and female, to Bergaigne's insistence on which reference was made above (p. 43), even here in this most obvious of forms, common to so many religions, shows
itself so faintly that it fails utterly to support that basis of sexual dualism on which the French scholar lays so much stress. Dyaus does, indeed, occasionally take the place of Indra, and as a bellowing bull impregnate earth, but this is wholly incidental and not found at all in the hymns directly lauding Heaven and Earth. Moreover, instead of "father and mother " Heaven and Earth often are spoken of as " the two mothers," the significance of which cannot be nullified by the explanation that to the Hindu 'two mothers' meant two parents,
and of two parents one must be male, — Bergaigne's explanation. For not only is Dyaus one of the 'two mothers,' but when independently used the word Dyaus is male or female indifferently. Thus in X. 93. i : " O Heaven and Earth be wide outstretched for us, (be) like two young women." The position of Heaven and Earth in relation to other divinities
varies with the fancy of the poet that extols them. They are
either created, or they create gods, as well as create men. In accordance with the physical reach of these deities they are
exhorted to give strength whereby the worshipper shall " overreach all peoples "; and, as parents, to be the " nearest of the
gods," to be "like father and mother in kindness." (I, 159 ;
160. 2, 5.)
1 I. 160. 4; iv. 56. 1-3 ; vii. 53. j..



60 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
One more attribute remains to be noticed, whicii connects Dyaus morally as well as physically with Savitar and Varuna.
The verse in which this attribute is spoken of is also not with
out interest from a sociological point of view : " Whatsoever sin we have committed against the gods, or against a friend,
or against the chief of the clan (family) ^ may this hymn to Heaven and Earth avert it." It was shown above that Savitar removes sin. Here, as in later times, it is the hymn that
does this. The mystery of these gods' origin puzzles the seer : " Which was first and which came later, how were they begotten, who knows, O ye wise seers ? Whatever exists, that they carry." ^ But all that they do they do under the command of
Mitra.^ The most significant fact in connection with the hymns to
Heaven and Earth is that most of them are expressly for
sacrificial intent. " With sacrifices I praise Heaven and
Earth" (I. 159. i); "For the sake of the sacrifice are ye come
down (to us)" (iv. 56. 7). In vi. 70 they are addressed in
sacrificial metaphors ; in vii. 53. i the poet says : " I invoke
Heaven and Earth with sacrifices," etc. The passivity of the two gods makes them yield in importance to their son, the active Savitar, who goes between the two parents. None of these hymns bears the impress of active religious feeling or has
poetic value. They all seem to be reflective, studied, more or
less mechanical, and to belong to a period of theological philosophy. To Earth alone without Heaven are addressed one uninspired hymn and a fragment of the same character : " O Earth be kindly to us, full of dwellings and painless, and give us protection."* In the burial service the dead are exhorted to "go into kindly mother earth" who will be "wool-soft, like a maiden." * The one hymn to Earth should perhaps be placed
1 I. 185. 8 (Jasfait). The expiatory power of the hymn occurs again in I. 159. ^ I- 1S5. 1. B iv. 56. 7. 4 I. 22. 13. 5 X. 18. 10 (or: "like a wool-soft maiden").



VARUNA. 61
parallel with similar meditative and perfunctory laudations in the Homeric hymns :
To Earth (v. 84).
In truth, O broad extended earthy Thou bear'st the render of the hills,l Thou who, O mighty mountainous one, Quickenest created things with might. Thee praise, O thou that wander'st far, The hymns which light accompany, Thee who, O shining one, dost send Lilce eager steeds the gushing rain. Thou mighty art, who boldest up With strength on earth the forest trees. When rain the rains that from thy clouds And Dyaus' far-gleaming lightning come.^
On the bearing of these facts, especially in regard to the secondary greatness of Dyaus, we shall touch below. He is a god exalted more by modern writers than by the Hindus !
VARUNA.
Varuna has been referred to already in connection with the sun-god and with Heaven and Earth. It is by Varuna's power that they stand firm. He has established the sun ' like a tree,'
i.e., like a support, and ' made a path for it.' ^ He has a thou
sand reme_dies for ills ; to his realm not even the birds can ascend, nor wind or swift waters attain. It is in accordance with the changeless order ' of Varuna that the stars and the moon go their regular course ; he gives long life and releases from harm, from wrong, and from sin.^
1 The lightning. In I. 31. 4, 10 "(Father) Fire makes Dyaus bellow" like "a bull " (v. 36. 5). Dyaus " roars '' in vi. 72. 3. Nowhere else is he a thunderer. 2 I. 24. 7-8. The change in metaphor is not unusual. 8 This word means either order or orders (law) ; literally the ' way ' or ' course.' 4 I. 24 (epitomized).



62 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Varuna is the most exalted of those gods whose origin is physical. His realm is all above us ; the sun and stars are his eyes ; he sits above upon his golden throne and sees all that
passes below, even the thoughts of men. He is, above all, the
moral controller of the universe.
To Varuna (i. 25).
Howe'er we, who thy people are, O Varuna, thou shining god. Thy order injure, day by day. Yet give us over nor to death. Nor to the blow of angry (foe), , . Nor to the wrath of (foe) incensed.i
Thy mind for mercy we release
As charioteer, a fast-bound steed By means of song, O Varuna. ,
('T is Varuna) who knows the track Of birds that fly within the air. And knows the ships upon the flood; '^ Knows, too, the (god) of order firm. The twelve months with their progeny, And e'en which month is later born ;
'
Knows, too, the pathway of the wind. The wide, the high, the mighty (wind). And knows who sit above (the wind).
(God) of firm order, Varuna His place hath ta'en within (his) home For lordship, he, the very strong.* Thence all the things that are concealed He looks upon, considering Whate'er is done and to be done. May he, the Son of Boundlessness, The very strong, through every day Make good our paths, prolong our life.
1 Perhaps better with Ludwig " of (thee) in anger, of (thee) incensed." 2 Or: " Being (himself) in the (heavenly) flood he knows the ships." (Ludwig.) B An intercalated month is meant (not the primitive * twelve days '). 4 Or ' very wise,' of mental strength.



VARUNA. 63
Bearing a garment all of gold, In jewels clothed, is Varuna, And round about him sit his spies
;
A god whom injurers injure not, Nor cheaters cheat among the folk. Nor any plotters plot against
;
"Who for himself 'mid (other) men Glory unequalled gained, and gains (Such glory) also 'mid ourselves.
Far go my thoughts (to him), as go The eager cows that meadows seek, Desiring (him), the wide-eyed (god). Together let us talk again, Since now the offering sweet I bring. By thee beloved, and like a priest Thou eat'st. I see the wide-eyed (god) I I see his chariot on the earth. My song with joy hath he received.
Hear this my call, O Varuna, Be merciful to me today, For thee, desiring help, I yearn.
Thou, wise one, art of everything. The sky and earth alike, the Jcing ; As such upon thy way give ear. And loose from us the (threefold) bond
;
The upper bond, the middle, break, . The lower, too, that we may live.
In the portrait of such a god as this one comes very near to monotheism. The conception of an almost solitary deity, recognized as watcher of wrong, guardian of right, and primitive creator, approaches more closely to unitarianism than does the idea of any physical power in the Rig Veda. To the poet of the Rig Veda Varuna is the enveloping heaven ; ' that is, in distinction from Dyaus, from whom he
1 viii. 4f. 7 ; vii. 8z. 6 (Bergaigne) ; X. 132. 4.



64 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
differs ioto caelo, so to speak, the invisible world, which em
braces the visible sky. His home is there where lives the Unborn, whose place is unique, above the highest heaven.'
But it is exactly this loftiness of character thaFshould make
one shy of interpreting Varuna as being originally the god that is presented here. Can this god, 'most august of Vedic
deities,' as Bergaigne and others have called him, have be
longed as such to the earliest stratum of Aryan belief ? There are some twelve hymns in the Rig Veda in Varuna's honor. Of these, one in the tenth book celebrates Indra as opposed to Varuna, and generally it is considered late, in
virtue of its content. Of the hymns in the eighth book the
second appears to be a later imitation of the first, and the first
appears, from several indications, to be of comparatively recent
o/igin.^ In the seventh book (vii. 86-89) ^^^ short final hymn
contains a distinctly late trait in invoking Varuna to cure dropsy ; the one preceding this is in majorem gloriam of the poet Vasistha, fitly following the one that appears to be as new, where not only the mysticism but the juggling with " thrice-sevsn," shows the character of the hymn to be
recent.^ In the first hymn of this book the late doctrine of inherited sin stands prominently forth (vii. 86. 5) as an indication of the time in which it was composed. The fourth and sixth books have no separate hymns to Varuna. In the fifth book the position of the one hymn to Varuna is one
favorable to spurious additions, but the hymn is not otherwise
obnoxious to the criticism of lateness. Of the two hymns in the second book, the first is addressed only indirectly to Varuna, nor is he here very prominent ; the second (ii. 28) is the only song which stands on a par with the hymn already

VARUNA. 65
translated. There remain the hymns cited above from the first, not a family-book. It is, moreover, noteworthy that in
ii. 28, apart from the ascription of general greatness, almost
all that is said of Varuna is that he is a priest, that he causes rivers to flow, and loosens the bond of sin.^ The finest hymn
to Varuna, from a literary point of view, is the one translated
above, and it is mainly on the basis of this hymn that the lofty
character of Varuna has been interpreted by occidental writers.
To our mind this hymn belongs to the close of the first epoch of the three which the hymns represent. That it cannot be very early is evident from the mention of the intercalated month, not to speak of the image of Varuna eating the sweet oblation ' like a priest.' Its elevated language is in sharp contrast- to that of almost all' the other Varuna hymns. As these are all the hymns where Varuna is praised alone by himself, it becomes of chief importance to study him here, and
not where, as in iii. 62, iv. 41, vi. 51, 67, 68, and elsewhere, he is lauded as part of a combination of gods (Mitra or Indra united with Varuna). In the last book of the Rig Veda there is no hymn to Varum, ^ a time when pantheistic monotheism was changing into pantheism, so that, in the last stage of the Rig Veda, Varuna is descended from the height. Thereafter he is god and husband of waters, and punisher of secret sin (as in ii. 28). Important in contrast to the hymn translated
above is v. 85.
To Varuna.
" I will sing forth unto the universal king a high deep prayer, dear to renowned Varuna, who, as a butcher a hide, has struck earth apart (from the sky) for the sun. Varuna has
1 Varuna's forgiving of sins may be explained as a washing out of sin, just as fire burns it out, and so loosens therewith the imagined bond, V. 2. 7. Thus, quite apart
from Varuna in a hymn addressed to the ' Waters,' is found the prayer, " O waters, carry off whatever sin is in me . . . and untruth," I. 23. 22. 2 But as in iv. 42, so in x. 124 he shares glory with Indra.



66 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
extended air in trees, strength in horses, milk in cows, and has laid wisdom in hearts ; fire in water ; the sun in the sky ; soma
in the stone. Varuna has inverted his water-barrel and let the
two worlds with the space between flow (with rain). With this
(heavenly water-barrel) he, the king of every created thing, wets the whole world, as a rain does a meadow. He wets the world, both earth and heaven, when he, Varuna, chooses to
milk out (rain) — and then do the mountains clothe themselves with cloud, and even the strongest men grow weak. Yet another great and marvellous power of the renowned spirit (Asura) will I proclaim, this, that standing, in mid-air he has
measured earth with the sun, as if with a measuring rod. (It is due to) the marvellous power of the wisest god, which none ever resisted, that into the' one confluence run the rivers, and pour into it, and fill it not. O Varuna, loosen whatever sin we have committed to bosom-friend, comrade, or brother ; to our own house, or to the stranger ; what (we) have sinned like gamblers at play, real (sin), or what we have not known. Make loose, as it were, all these things, O god Varuna, and may we be dear to thee hereafter."
In this hymn Varuna is a water-god, who stands in mid-air
and directs the rain ; who, after the rain, reinstates the sun ; who releases from sin (as water does from dirt ?). "According to this conception it would seem that Varuna were the 'coverer' rather than the ' encompasser.' It might seem probable even that Varuna first stood to Dyaus as cloud and
rain and night to shining day, and that his counterpart,
Oupavo's, stood in the same relation to Zevs ; that Oupavos were connected with oipe'o) and Varuna with van, river, vari, water.-'
1 Later, Varuna's water-office is his only physical side. Compare Ait. Ar. ii. i. 7. 7,
' water and Varuna, children of mind.' Compare with vdri, oipd = vara, and varl, an old word for rivers, vars {= var + y),'rain.' The etymology is very doubtful on account of the number of var-roots. Perhaps dew (eptra) and rain first as
' coverer.' Even var = vas ' shine,' has been suggested (ZDMG. xxii. 603).



VARUNA. 67
It is possible, but it is not provable. But no interpretation of Varuna that ignores his rainy side can be correct. And this is fully recognized by Hillebraiidt. On account of his " thousand
spies," i.e., eyes, he has been looked upon by some as exclusively a night-god. But this is too one-sided an interpretation,
and passes over the all-important fact that it is only in con
junction with the sun (Mitra), where there is a strong antithesis, that the night-side of the god is exclusively displayed. Wholly a day-god he cannot be, because he rules night and rain. He
is par excellence the Asura, and, like Ahura Mazdao, has the sun for an eye, i.e., he is heaven. But there is no Varuna in
Iranian worship and Ahura is a sectarian specialization. Without this name may one ascribe to India what is found in Iran?'' It has been suggested by Bergaigne that Varuna and Vritra, the rain-holding demon, were developments from the same idea, one revered as a god, the other, a demon ; and that the word means ' restrainer,' rather than ' encompasser.' From all this it will be evident that to claim an original monotheism as still surviving in the person of Varuna, is impossible ; and this is the one point we would make. -Every one must admire the fine hymn in which he is -praised, but what there is in it does not make it seem very old, and the intercalated month is decisive evidence, for here alone in the Rig Veda is mentioned this month, which implies the five-year cyclus, but this belongs to the Brahmanic period (Weber,
Vedische Beitrdge, p. 38). Every explanation of the original nature of Varuna must take into consideration that he is a
rain-god, a day-god, and a night-god injurn, and that where he Ts^aised in the most elevated language the rain-side disap
pears, although it was fundamental, as may be seen by comparing many passages, where Varuna is exhorted to give rain, where his title is ' lord of streams,' his position that of ' lord

Varna with four gates " !



68 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
of waters.' The decrease of Varuna worship in favor of Indra results partly from the more peaceful god of rain appearing less admirable than the monsoon-god, who overpowers with storm
and lightning, as well as ' wets the earth.' The most valuable contribution to the study of Varuna is Hillebrandt's 'Varuna and Mitra.' This author has succeeded in completely overthrowing the old error that Varuna is exclu
sively a night-god.^ Quite as definitively he proves that Varuna
is not exclusively a day-god. Bergaigne, on the other hand, claims an especially tenebrous character for Varuna.^ Much has been written on luminous deities by scholars that fail to recognize the fact that the
Hindus regard the night both as light and as dark. But to
the Vedic poet the night, star-illumined, was bright. Even Hillebrandt speaks of "the bright heaven " of day as "opposed to the dark night-heaven in which Varuna also shows himself."^
In the Rig Veda, as it stands, with all the different views of Varuna side by side, Varuna is a universal encompasser, moral as well as physical. K% such his physical side is almost gone. But the conception of him as a moral watcher and sole lord of the universe is in so sharp contrast to the figure of the rain
god, who, like Parjanya, stands in mid-air and upsets a waterbarrel, that one must discriminate even between the Vedic views in regard to him.^ It is Varuna who lets rivers flow ; with Indra he is besought
not to let his weapons fall on the sinner ; wind is his breath.*
1 In India : What Can it Teach us, pp. 197, 200, Miiller tacitly recognizes in the pliysical Varuna only the * starry ' night-side. 2 Loc. cit. III. 119. Bergaigne admits Varuna as god of waters, but sees in him identity with Vritra <i 'restrainer of waters.' He thinks the, 'luminous side' of Varuna to be antique also (III. 117-119). Varuna's cord, according to Bergaigne, comes from * tying up ' the waters ; ' night's fetters,' according to Hillebrandt. 3 Loc. cit. p. 13. 4 One of the chief objections to Bergaigne's conception of Varuna as waterrestrainer is that it does not explain the antique union with Mitra. 6 II. 28. 4, 7; vii. 82. I, 2; 87. .;.



VARUNA. 69
On the other hand he is practically identified with the sun.i
How ill this last agrees with the image of a god who ' lives by
the spring of rivers,' ' covers earth as with a garment,' and 'rises like a secret sea (in fog) to heaven' l'^ Even when invoked with the sun, Mitra, Varuna still gives rain : " To whomsoever ye two are kindly disposed comes sweet rain from heaven ; we beseech you for rain . . . you, the thunderers who go through
earth and heaven " (v. 63), — a strange prayer to be addressed
to a monotheistic god of light ! " Ye make the lightning flash, ye send the rain ; ye hide the sky in cloud and rain " {ib}). In the hymn preceding we read : " Ye make firm heaven and earth, ye give growth to plants, milk to cows ; O ye that give rain, pour down rain ! " In the same group another short hymn declares: "They are universal kings, who have ghee
(rain) in their laps ; they are lords of the rain " (v. 68). In the next hymn : " Your clouds (cows) give nourishment, your streams are sweet." Thus the twain keep the order of the
seasons (i. 2. 7-8) and protect men by the regular return of the rainy season. Their weapons are always lightning (above, i. 152. 2, and elsewhere). A short invocation in a family-book gives this prayer : " O Mitra -Varuna, wet our meadows with ghee; wet all places with the sweet drink" (iii. 62. 16).
The interpretation given above of the office of Varuna as regards the sun's path, is supported by a verse where is made an allusion to the time " when they release the sun's horses," i.e., when after two or three months of rain the sun shines again (v. 62. i). In another verse one reads: "Ye. direct the waters, sustenance of earth and heaven, richly let come
your rains" (viii. 25. 6). Now there is nothing startling in this view. In opposition
to the unsatisfactory attempts of modern scholars, it is the

70 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
traditional interpretation of Mitra and Varuna that Mitra is
the god of day {i.e., the sun), and Varuna the god of night {i.e.,
covering),^ while native belief regularly attributes to him the lordship of water.^ The ' thousand_eyes ' of Varuna are the
result of this view. The other light-side of Varuna as special
lord of day (excluding the all-heaven idea with the sun as his
' eye ') is elsewhere scarcely referred to, save in late hymns and viii. 41.? In conjunction with the storm-god, Indra, the wrath-side of Varuna is further developed. The prayer for
release is from ' long darkness,' i.e., from death ; in other
words, may the light of life be restored (ii. 27. 14-15 ; ii. 28. 7). Grassmann, who believes that in Varuna there is an early monotheistic deity, enumerates all his offices and omits the giving of rain from the list ; ^ while Ludwig derives his name from var (=velle) and defines him as the lofty god who
wills ! Varuna's highest development ushers in the middle period
of the Rig Veda ; before the rise of the later All-father, and
even before the great elevation of Indra. But when Siirya and Dawn were chief, then Varuna was chiefest. There is no monotheism in the worship of a god who is regularly associated as one of a pair with another god. Nor is there in Varuna any religious grandeur which, so far as it exceeds that of other divinities, is not evolved from his old physical side.
One cannot personify heaven and write a descriptive poem about him without becoming elevated in style, as compared
with, the tone of one that praises a rain-cloud or even the more confined personality of the sun. There is a stylistic but not a metaphysical descent from this earlier period in the ' lords of the atmosphere,' for, as we shall show, the elevation of Indra

VARUNA. 71
-and Agni denotes a philosophical conception yet more advanced
than the almost monotheistic greatness attained by Varuna. But one must find the background to this earlier period ; and in it Varuna is not monotheistic. He is the covering sky
united with the sun, or he whose covering is rain and dew. Indra treats Varuna as Savitar treats Mitra, supplants him ; and for the same reason, because each represents the same priestly philosophy.
In the one extant hymn to Mitra (who is Indo-Iranian) it is Mitra that 'watches men,' and ' bears earth and heaven.' He
is here (iii. 59) the kindly sun, his name (Mitra, 'friend') being frequently punned upon. The point of view taken by Earth deserves comment. He says •} "It has sometimes been maintained that the Varuna of the hymns is a god in a state of decadence. In this view we can by no means concur ; ... an appeal to these few hymns is enough to prove that in the consciousness of their authors
the divinity of Varuna stood still intact." If, instead of 'still
intact,' the author had said, ' on the increase, till undermined
by still later philosophical speculation,' the true position, in
our opinion, would have been given. But a distinction must be made between decadence of greatness and decadence of popularity. It has happened in the case of some of the Vedic inherited gods that exactly in proportion as their popularity
decreased their greatness increased ; that is to say, as they became more vague and less individual to the folk they were
expanded into wider circles of relationship by the theosophist,
and absorbed other gods' majesty. Varuna is no longer a popular god in the Rig Veda. He is already a god of speculation, only the speculation did not go far enough to suit the
later seers of Indra-Savitar-hood. Most certainly his worship, when compared in popularity with that of Agni and Indra, is unequal. But this is because he is too remote to be popular.
1 Religions of India, p. 1 7.



72 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
What made the popular gods was a union of near physical force to please the vulgar, with philosophical mysticism to please the priest, and Indra and Agni fulfilled the conditions,
while awful, but distant, Varuna did not. In stating that the great hymn to Varuna is not typical of
the earliest stage of religious belief among the Vedic Aryans, we should add one word in explanation. Varuna's traits, as shown in other parts of the Rig Veda, are so persistent that they must be characteristic of his original function. It does
not follow, however, that any one hymn in which he is lauded is necessarily older than the hymn cited from the first book. The earliest stage of religious development precedes the^ entrance into the Punjab. It may even be admitted that at the time when the Vedic Aryans became Hindus, that is, when they settled about the Indus, Varuna was the great god we see him in the great hymn to his honor. But while the relation
of the Adityas to the spirits of Ahura in Zoroaster's system
points to this, yet it is absurd to assume this epoch as the start
ing point of Vedic belief. Back of this period lies one in which Varuna was by no means a monotheistic deity, nor even
the greatest divinity among the gods. The fact, noticed by Hillebrandt, that the Vasishtha family are the chief praisers of Varuna, may also indicate that his special elevation was due
to the theological conceptions of one clan, rather than of the whole people, since in the other family books he is worshipped more as one of a pair, Varuna and Mitra, heaven and sun.
ADITI.
The mother of Varuna and the luminous gods is the 'mother of kings,' Boundlessness {aditi^^ a product of priestly theosophy. Aditi makes, perhaps, the first approach to formal pan
1 The Rik knows, also, a Diti, but merely as antithesis to Aditi — the ' confined and unconfined.' Aditi is prayed to (for protection and to remove sin) in sporadic verses of several hymns addressed to other gods, but she has no hymn.



DAWN. 73
theism in India, for all gods, men, and things are identified with her (i. 89. 10). Seven children of Aditi are mentioned,
to whom is added an eighth (in one hymn).' The chief of
these, who \s par excelkHce the Aditya (son of Aditi), is Varuna.
Most of the others are divinities of the sun (x. 72). With
Varuna stands Mitra, and besides this pair are found 'the
true friend' Aryaman, Savitar, Bhaga, and, later, Indra, as
sun (?). Daksha and Anga are also reckoned as Adityas, and
Surya is enumerated among them as a divinity distinct from Savitar. But the word aditi, 'unbound,' is often a mere epithet,
of Fire, Sky, etc. Moreover, in one passage, at least, aditi
simply means 'freedom' (i. 24. 1), less boundlessness than
' un-bondage ' ; so, probably, in i. 185. 3, ' the gift of freedom.'
An5a seems to have much the same meaning with Bhaga, viz., the sharer, giver. Daksha may, perhaps, be the 'clever,' 'strong' one (Se^ios), abstract Strength; as another name of
the sun (.?). Aditi herself (according to Miiller, Infinity; accord
ing to Hillebrandt, Eternity) is an abstraction that is born later than her chief sons. Sun and Varuna.^ Zarathustra (Zoroaster, not earlier than the close of the first Vedic period) took the seven Adityas and reformed them into one monotheistic (dual
istic) Spirit (Ahura), with a circle of six moral attendants, thereby dynamically destroying every physical conception of them.
DAWN.
We have devoted considerable space to Varuna because of the theological importance with which is invested his personal
ity. If one admit that a monotheistic Varuna is the z^r-Varuna, if one see in him a sign that the Hindus originally worshipped
one universally great superior god, whose image effaced that

74 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
of all the others/ then the attempt to trace any orderly development in Hindu theology may as well be renounced ; and one must imagine that this peculiar people, starting with monothe
ism descended to polytheism, and then leapt again into the conception of that Father-god whose form, in the end of the Rig Vedic period, out-varunas Varuna as encompasser and lord of all. If, on the other hand, one see in Varuna a god who,
from the ' covering,' heaven and cloud and rain, from earliest time has been associated with the sun as a pair, and recognize in Varuna's loftier form the product of that gradual elevation to which were liable all the gods at the hands of the Hindu
priests ; if one see in him at this stage the highest god which a theology, based on the worship of natural phenomena, was able to evolve ; then, for the reception of those gods who overthrew him from his supremacy, because of their greater freedom from physical restraints, there is opened a logical and
historical path — until that god comes who in turn follows these half-embodied ones, and stands as the first immaterial
author of the universe — and so one may walk straight from the physical beginning of the Rig Vedic religion to its spiritual Brahmanic end. We turn now to one or two phenomena-deities that were never much tampered with by priestly speculation ; their forms being still as bright and clear as when the first Vedic wor
shipper, waiting to salute the rising sun, beheld in all her beauty, and thus praised
The Dawn.2
As comes a bride hath she approached us, gleaming ;
All things that live she rouses now to action.
A
fire is born that shines for human beings ; Light hath she made, and driven away the darkness.
1 That is to say, if one believe that the ' primitive Aryans ' were innoculated with Zoroaster's teaching. This is the sort of Varuna that Roth believes to have existed
among the aboriginal Aryan tribes (above, p. 13, note 2). 2 vii. 77.



DA WN. 75
Wide-reaching hath she risen, to all approaching,
And shone forth clothed in garments white and glistening,
Of gold her color, fair to see her look is. Mother of kine,l leader of days she gleameth.
Bearing the gods' eye, she, the gracious maiden,

Leading along the white and sightly charger 2 Aurora, now is seen, revealed in glory, With shining guerdons unto all appearing.
O near and dear one, light far off our foes, and Make safe to us our kines' wide pasture-places. Keep from us hatred ; what is good, that bring us, And send the singer wealth, O generous maiden.
With thy best beams for us do thou beam widely, Aurora, goddess bright, our life extending
;
And food bestow, O thou all goods possessing. Wealth, too, bestowing, kine and steeds and war-cars
Thou whom Vasistha's ^ sons extol with praise's. Fair-born Aurora, daughter of Dyaus, the bright one. On us bestow thou riches high and mighty,
— O all ye gods with weal forever guard us.
In the laudation of Varuna the fancy of the poet exhausts itself in lofty imagery, and reaches the topmost height of Vedic
religious lyric. In the praise of Dawn it descends not lower than to interweave beauty with dignity of utterance. Nothing in religious poetry more graceful or delicate than the Vedic
Dawn-hymns has ever been wrftten. In the daily vision of Dawn following her sister Night the poet sees his fairest god
dess, and in his worship of her there is love and admiration, such as is evoked by the sight of no other deity. " She comes like a fair young maiden, awakening all to labor, with an hundred chariots comes she, and brings the shining light ; gleam forth, O Dawn, and give us thy blessing this day ; for in thee
is the life of every living creature. Even as thou hast rewarded
the singers of old, so now reward our song" (i. 48).
1 Clouds. 2 The sun. s The priest to whom, and to whose family, is ascribed the seventh book.



76 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The kine of Dawn are the bright clouds that, like red cattle,
wander in droves upon the horizon. Sometimes the rays of
light, which stretch across the heaven, are intended by this
image, for the cattle-herding poets employed their flocks as
figures for various ends.
The inevitable selfish pessimism of unripe reflection is also woven into the later Dawn-hymns : " How long will it be ere this Dawn, too, shall join the Dawns departed? Vanished are now the men that saw the Dawns of old ; we here see her now ;
there will follow others who will see her hereafter ; but, O
Dawn, beam here thy fairest ; rich in blessings, true art thou
to_ friend and right. Bring hither (to the morning sacrifice)
the gods " (i. 113). Since the metre (here ignored) of the following hymn is not
all of one model, it is probable that after the fourth verse a new hymn began, which was distinct from the first ; but the argurhent'from metre is unconvincing, and in any event both songs are worth citing, since they show how varied were the images and fancies of the poets: "The Dawns are like heroes with golden weapons ; like red kine of the morning on the field of heaven ; shining they weave their webs of light, like women
active at work ; food they bring to the pious worshipper. Like a dancing girl is the Dawn adorned, and opens freely her bosom ; as a cow gives milk, as a cow comes forth from its stall, so opens she her breast, so comes she out of the darkness
(verses 1-4) . . . She is the ever new, born again and again, adorned always with the same color. As a player conceals the dice, so keeps she concealed the days of a man ; daughter of Heaven she wakes and drives away her sister (Night). Like kine, like the waves of a flood, with sunbeams she appears.
O rich Dawn, bring us wealth ; harness thy red horses, and bring to us success " (i. 92). The homage to Dawn is natur- , ally divided at times with that to the sun : " Fair shines the
light of morning ; the sun awakens us to toil ; along the path



DA WN. 77
of order goes Dawn arrayed in light. She extendeth herself in
the east, and gleameth till she fills the sky and earth " ; and again : " Dawn is the great work of Varuna and Mitra
;
through the sun is she awakened" (i. 124; iii. 61. 6-7). In
the ritualistic period Dawn is still mechanically lauded, and her
beams "rise in the east like pillars of sacrifice" (iv. 51. 2);
but otherwise the imagery of the selections given above is that which is usually employed. The 'three dawns' occasionally
referred to are, as we have shown elsewhere,^ the three. dawnlights, white, red, and yellow, as they are seen by both the Vedic poet and the Florentine.
Dawn becomes common and trite after awhile, as do all the gods, and is invoked more to give than to please. ' Wake us,'
cries a later poet, ' Wake us to wealth, O Dawn ; give to us,
give to us ; wake up, lest the sun burn thee with his light ' a passage (v. 79) which has caused much learned nonsense to be written on the inimical relations of Sun and Dawn as
portrayed here. The dull idea is that Dawn is lazy, and had better get up before Surya catches her asleep. The poet is not in the least worried because his image does not express a suitable relationship between the dawn and the sun, nor need
others be disturbed at it. The hymn is late, and only important in showing the new carelessness as regards the old gods.^ Some other traits appear in vii. 75. i £f., where Dawn is 'queen
of the world,' and banishes -the di-uhs, or evil spirit. She here is daughter of Heaven, and wife of the sun (4, 5); ib. 76. i, she is the eye. of the world; and ib. 81. 4, she is invoked as
' mother.' There is, at times, so close a resemblance between Dawnhymns and Sun-hymns that the imagery employed in one is
1 JAOS., XV. 270. ^ Much theosophy, and even history (!), has been read into ii. 15, and iv. 30, where poets speak of Indra slaying Dawn; but there is nothing remarliable in these passages. Poetry is not creed. The monsoon (here Indra) does away with dawns for a time, and that is what the poet says in his own way.



78 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
used in the other. Thus the hymn vi. 64 begins : " The beams of Dawn have arisen, shining as shine the waters' gleaming waves. She makes good paths, . . . she banishes darkness as a warrior drives away a foe (so of the sun, iv,
13. 2 ; X. 37. 4; 170. 2). Beautiful are thy paths upon the
mountains, and across the waters thou shinest, self-gleaming " (also of the sun). With the last expression may be compared
that in' vi. 65. 5 : " Dawn, whose seat is upon the hills." Dawji is intimately connected not only with Agni but with
the Twin Horsemen, the Agvins (equites) — if not so intimately
connected as is Helen with the Dioskouroi, who, pace Pischel, are the Agvins of Hellas. This relationship is more empha
sized in the hymns to the latter gods, but occasionally occurs in Dawn-hymns, of which another is here translated in full.
To Dawn (iv. 52).
The Daughter of Heaven, this beauteous maid, Resplendent leaves her sister (Night), < And now before (our sight) appears.
Red glows she like a shining mare,
Mother of kine, who timely comes The Horsemen's friend Aurora is.
Both friend art thou of the Horsemen twain, And mother art thou of the kine. And thou, Aurora, rulest wealth.
We wake thee with our praise as one
Who foes removes ; such thought is ours, O thou that art possess! of joy.
Thy radiant beams beneficent Like herds of cattle now appear ; Aurora fills the wide expanse.
With light hast thou the dark removed, Filling (the world), O brilliant one. Aurora, help us as thou us'st.
With rays thou stretchest through the heaven And through the fair wide space between, O Dawn, with thy refulgent light.



£>A WN. 79
It was seen that Savitar (Pushan) is the rising and setting sun. So, antithetic to Dawn, stands the Abendroth with her
sister. Night. This last, generally, as in the hymn just trans
"
lated, is lauded only in connection with Dawn, and for herself alone gets but one hymn, and that is not in a family-book.
She is to be regarded, therefore, less as a goddess of the pan
theon than as a quasi-goddess, the result of a poet's meditative
imagination, rather than one of the folk's primitive objects of adoration ; somewhat as the English poets personify " Ye clouds, that far above me float and pause, ye ocean-waves ... ye woods, that listen to the night-bird's singing, O ye loud waves, and O ye forests high, and O ye clouds that far above me
soared; thou rising sun, thou blue rejoicing sky!" — and as in Greek poetry, that which before has been conceived of vaguely as divine suddenly is invested with a divine personality. The later poet exalts these aspects of nature, and endows those that were before only half recognized with a
little special praise. So, whereas Night was divine at first merely as the sister of divine Dawn, in the tenth book one
poet thus gives her praise ;
Hymn to Night (x. 127).
Night, shining goddess, comes, who now Looks out afar with many eyes, And putteth all her beauties on.
Immortal shining goddess, she The depths and heights alike hath filled, And drives with light the dark away.
To me she comes, adorned well, A darkness black now sightly made
;
Pay then thy debt, O Dawn, and go.i
1 Transferred by Roth from the penultimate position where it stands in the original. Dawn here pays Night for the latter's matutinal withdrawing by withdrawing herself. Strictly speaking, the Dawn is, of course, the sunset Ught conceived of as identical with that preceding the sunrise {itsns, i}c6s, 'east' as 'glow').



80 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The bright one coming put aside Her sister Dawn (the sunset light), And lo ! the darkness hastes away.
So (kind art thou) to us ; at whose Appearing we retire to rest, As birds fly homeward to the tree.
To rest are come the throngs of men ; To rest, the beasts ; to rest, the birds ; And e'en the greedy eagles rest.
Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf, Keep off the thief, O billowy Night, Be thou to us a saviour now.
To thee, O Night, as 'twere an herd, To a conqueror (brought), bring I an hymn Daughter of Heaven, accept (the gift).i
THE ACVINS.
The Agvins who are, as was said above, the ' Horsemen,' parallel to the Greek Dioskouroi, are twins, sons of Dyaus, husbands, perhaps brothers of the Dawn. They have been
variously ' interpreted,' yet in point of fact one knows no more now what was the original conception of the twain than was known before Occidental scholars began to study them.^ Even the ancients made mere guesses : the A^vins came before the Dawn, and are so-called because they ride on horses (a(va, eguos); they represent either Heaven and Earth, or Day and
1 Late as seems this hymn to be, it is interesting in revealing the fact that wolves (not tigers or panthers) are the poet's most dreaded foes of night. It must, therefore have been composed in the northlands, where wolves are the herdsman's worst enemies. 2 Myriantheus, Die A^vins ; Muir, OST. v. p. 234 ; Bergaigne, Religion Vedigue, ii. p. 43T ; MUller, Lectures, 2d series, p. 508 ; Weber, Md. St. v. p. 234. Sayana on i. 180. 2, interprets the * sister of the A5vins ' as Dawn.



THE ACVINS. 81
Night, or Sun and Moon, or two earthly kings — such is the unsatisfactory information given by the Hindus themselves/ Much the same language with that in the Dawn-hymns is naturally employed in praising the Twin Brothers. They, like
the Dioskouroi, are said to have been incorporated gradually into the pantheon, on an equality with the other gods,^ not because they were at first human beings, but because they, like Night, were adjuncts of Dawn, and got their divinity through her as leader.' In the last book of the Rig Veda they are the sons of Saranyu and Vivasvant, but it is not certain whether Saranyu means dawn or not ; in the first book they are born of the flood (in the sky).^ They are sons of Dyaus,
but this, too, only in the last and first books, while in the
latter they are separated once, so that only one is called the Son of the Sky.° They follow Dawn 'like men' (viii. 5. 2) and are in B'rahmanic literature the 'youngest of the gods.' ^ The twin gods are the physicians of heaven, while to men they bring all medicines and help in times of danger. They were apparently at first only 'wonder-workers,' for the original legends seem to have been few. Yet the striking similarity
in these aspects with the brothers of Helen must offset the fact that so much in connection with them seems to have been added in books one and ten. They restore the blind and decrepit, impart strength and speed, and give the power and seed of life ; even causing waters to flow, fire to burn, and trees to grow. As such they assist lovers and aid in producing
offspring. The A9vins are brilliantly described. Their bird-drawn chariot and all its appurtenances are of gold ; they are swift
1 Muir, loc. cii. Weber regards them as the (stars) Gemini. 2 Weber, however, thinks that Dawn and A9vins are equally old divinities, the oldest Hindu divinities in his estimation. 3 In the Epic (see below) they are called the lowest caste of gods (Qudras).

as thought, agile, young, and beautiful. Thrice they come to
the sacrifice, morning, noon, and eve ; at the yoking of their car, the dawn is born. When the 'banner before dawn' appears, the invocation to the Agvins begins; they 'accompany dawn.' Some variation of fancy is naturally to be looked for. Thus, though, as said above. Dawn is born at the A5vins yoking, yet Dawn is herself invoked to wake the A^vins ; while again the sun starts their chariot before Dawn ; and as sons of Zeus they are invoked " when darkness still stands among the shining clouds (cows)." ^ Husbands or brothers or children of Dawn, the Horsemen
are also Surya's husbands, and she is the sun's daughter
(Dawn ?) or the sun as female. But this myth is not without contradictions, for Surya elsewhere weds Soma, and the Agvins are the bridegroom's friends ; whom PCishan chose on this occasion as his parents ; he who (unless one with Soma) was the prior bridegroom of the same much-married damsel.^ The current explanation of the Agvins is that they represent two periods between darkness and dawn, the darker period being nearer night, the other nearer day. But they probably,
as inseparable twins, are the twinlights or twilight, before
dawn, half dark and half bright. In this light it may well be said of them that one alone is the son of bright Dyaus, that both wed Dawn, or are her brothers. They always come together. Their duality represents, then, not successive stages but one stage in day's approach, when light is dark and dark
is light. In comparing the Agvins to other pairs'^ this dual nature is frequently referred to ; but no less is there a triality in connection with them which often in describing them has been ignored. This is that threefold light which opens day
;
and, as in many cases they join with Dawn, so their color is

inseparable. Strictly speaking, the break of red is the dawn and the white and yellow lights precede this.^ Thus in v.
73. S : " Red birds flew round you as Surya stepped upon your chariot"; so that it is quite impossible, in accordance with the poets themselves, to limit the A^vins to the twilight. They are a variegated growth from a black and white seed. The chief function of the Agvins, as originally conceived, was the finding and restoring of vanished light. Hence they are
invoked as finders and aid-gods in general (the myths are given in Myriantheus). Some very amusing and some silly legends have been collected and told by the Vedic poets in regard to the preserva
tion and resuscitating power of the A9vins — how an old man was rejuvenated by them (this is also done by the three Ribhus, master-workmen of the gods) ; how brides are provided by them ; how they rescued Bhujyu and others from the dangers of the deep (as in the classical legends) ; how they replaced a woman's leg with an iron one ; restored a saint's eye-sight
;
drew a seer out of a well, etc., etc» Many scholars follow Bergaigne in imagining all these miracles to be anthropomorphized forms of solar phenomena, the healing of the blind representing the bringing out of the sun from darkness, etc. To us such interpretation often seems fatuous. No less unconvincing is the claim that one of the Agvins represents the fire of heaven and the other the fire of the altar. The Twins are called nasatyd, the ' savers ' (or 'not untrue ones'); ^ explained by some as meaning 'gods with good noses.' ^
1 In Cat. Br. v. 5. 4. j, to the Agvins a red-white goat is sacrificed, because ' Agvins are red-white.' - Perhaps best with Brunnhofer, 'the savers' from nas as in nasjan (AG. p. 99). 3 La Religion Vedique, ii. p. 434. That ndsaiya means ' with good noses ' is an epic notion, nasatyadasrau stinasSii, Mbha. i. 3. 5S, and for this reason, if for no otlier (though idea is older), the etymology is probably false! The epithet is also Iranian. Twinned and especially paired gods are characteristic of the Rig Veda. Thus Yama and YamI are twins ; and of pairs Indra-Agni, Indra-Vayu, besides the older Mitra-Varuna, Heaven-Earth, are common.

Hymn to the Horsemen.
Whether ye rest on far-extended earth, or on the sea in house upon it made, come hither thence, O ye that ride the steeds. If ever for man ye mix the sacrifice, then notice now the Kanva [poet who sings]. I call upon the gods [Indra, Vishnu] ' and the swift-going Horsemen.^ These Horsemen I call now that they work wonders, to seize the works (of sacrifice), whose friendship is preeminently ours, and relationship among all the gods ; in reference to whom arise sacrifices ... If, to-day, O Horsemen, West or East ye stand, ye of good steeds, whether at Druhyu's, Anu's, Turvaya's, or Yadu's, I call ye ; come to me. If ye fly in the air, O givers of great joy; or if through the two worlds; or if, according to your pleasure, ye
mount the car, — thence come hither, O Horsemen,
From the hymn preceding this, the following verses:^
Whatever manliness is in the aether, in the sky, and among the five peoples, grant us that, O Horsemen . this hot soma-&nxik of yours with laudation is poured out ; this soma sweet through which ye discovered Vritra . . . Ascend the swift-rolling chariot, O Horsemen ; hither let these my praises bring ye, like a cloud . . . Come as guardians of homes
;
guardians of our bodies. Come to the house for (to give) children and offspring. Whether ye ride on the same car with Indra, or be in the same house with the Wind; whether united with the Sons of Boundlessness or the Ribhus, or stand on Vishnu's wide steps (come to us). This is the best help of the horsemen, if to-day I should entice them to get booty, or call them as my strength to conquer in battle. . Whatever medicine (ye have) far or near, with this now, O wise ones, grant protection. . . . Awake, O Dawn, the Horsemen, goddess, kind and great. . . . When, O Dawn, thou goest in light and shinest with the Sun, then hither comes the Horsemen's chariot, to the house men have to protect. When the swollen somastalks are milked like cows with udders, and when the choric songs are sung, then they that adore the Horsemen are preeminent. . . .
Here the Agvins are associated with Indra, and even find
the evil demon ; but, probably, at this stage Indra is more than god of storms.
1 Perhaps to be omitted. 2 Pischel, Ved. St. i. p. 4S. As swift-going gods they are called ' Indra-like.' 3 viii. 9 and 10.



THE ACVINS. SS
Some of the expanded myths and legends of the Agvins
may be found in i. ii8, 119, 158; x. 40. Here follows one with legends in moderate number (vii. 71):
Before the Dawn her sister, Night, withdraweth j The black one leaves the ruddy one a pathway. Ye that have kine and horses, you invoke we
;
By day, at night, keep far from us your arrow.
Come hither, now, and meet the pious mortal. And on your car, O Horsemen, bring him good things
;
Keep off from us the dry destroying sickness, By day, at night, O sweetest pair, protect us.
Your chariot may the joy-desiring chargers. The virile stallions, bring at Dawn's first coming; That car whose reins are rays, and wealth upon it
;
Come with the steeds that keep the season's order.
Upon the car, three-seated, full of riches. The helping car, that has a path all golden, On this approach, O lords of heroes, true ones, Let this food-bringing car of yours approach us.
Ye freed from his old age the man Cyavana ; Ye brought and gave the charger swift to Pedu ; Ye two from darkness' anguish rescued Atri; Ye set Jahusha down, released from fetters.^
This prayer, O Horsemen, and this song is uttered
;
Accept the skilful poem, manly heroes. These prayers, to you belonging, have ascended,
O
all ye gods protect us aye with blessings I ^
The sweets which the Agvins bring are either on their
chariot, or, as is often related, in a bag ; or they burst forth from the hoof of their steed. Pegasus' spring in Helicon has been compared with this. Their vehicles are variously pictured

86 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
as birds, horses, ships, etc. It is to be noticed that in no one
of their attributes are the Agvins unique. Otlier gods bring
sweets, help, protect, give oifspring, give healing medicines,
and, in short, do all that the Agvins do. But, as Bergaigne
points out, they do all this pacifically, while Indra, who performs some of their wonders, does so by storm. He protects by not injuring, and helps by destroying foes. Yet is this
again true only in general, and the lines between warlike,
peaceful, and ' sovereign ' gods are often crossed.



CHAPTER IV.
THE RIG VEDA (CONTINUED).— THE MIDDLE GODS.
Only one of the great atm ospheric d eitjes, the gods that preeminently govern the middle sphere between sky and earth, can claim an Aryan lineage. One of the minor gods of the same sphere, the ancient rain-god, also has this antique dig
nity, but in his case the dignity already is impaired by the
strength of a new and greater rival. In the case of thejwind
god, on the other hand, there is preserved a deity who was one of the primitive pantheon, belonging, perhaps, not only to the Iranians, but to the Teutons, for Vata, Wind, may be the Scandinavian Woden. The later mythologists on Indian soil make a distinction between Vata, wind, and Vayu (from the same
root ; as in German weheri), and in this distinction one
discovers that the old Vata, who must have been once the wind-god, is now reduced to physical (though sentient) wind, while the newer name represents the higher side of wind as a power lying back of phenomena ; and it is this latter con
ception alone that is utilized in the formation of the Vedic
triad of wind, fire, and sun. In short, in the use and appli
cation of the two names, there is an exact parallel to the double terminology employed to designate the sun as Surya and Savitar. Just as Surya is the older ijAtos and sol (acknowledged as a god, yet palpably the physical red body in
the sky) contrasted with the interpretation which, by a newer
name (Savitar), seeks to differentiate the (sentient) physical
from the spiritual, so is Vata, Woden, replaced and lowered
by the loftier conception of Vayu. But, again, just as, when the conception of Savitar is formed, the spiritualizing ten
dency reverts to Surya, and makes of him, too, a figure



88 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
reclothed in the more modern garb of speech, which is invented for Savitar alone ; so the retroactive theosophic fancy, after creating Vayu as a divine power underlying phenomenal Vata, reinvests Vata also with the garments of Vayu. Thus,
finally, the two, who are the result of intellectual differentiation, are again united from a new point of view, and'Surya
or Savitar, Vayu or Vata, are indifferently used to express
respectively the whole completed interpretation of the divinity,
which is now visible and invisible, sun and sun-god, wind and
wind-god. In these pairs there is, as it were, a perspective
of Hindu theosophy, and one can trace the god, as a spiritual entity including the physical, back to the physical prototype that once was worshipped as such alone. In the Rig Veda there are three complete hymns to Wind, none of these being in the family books. In x. i86, the poet calls on Wind to bring health to the worshipper, and to prolong his life. He addresses Wind as ' father and brother and friend,' asking the power that blows to bring him ambrosia, of which Wind has a store. These are rather pretty verses
without special theological intent, addressed more to Wind as such than to a spiritual power. The other hymn from the same book is directed to Vata also, not to Vayu, and though
it is loftier in tone and even speaks of Vata as the soul of the gods, yet is it evident that no consistent mythology has worked upon the purely poetic phraseology, which is occupied merely with describing the rushing of a mighty wind (x. i68). Nevertheless, Vata is worshipped, as is Vayu, with oblations.
Hymn to Wind (Vata).
Now Vata's chariot's greatness ! Breaking goes it, And thundering is its noise ; to heaven it touches, Goes o'er the earth, cloud i making, dust up-rearing;
1 Compare i. 134. 3.



THE MIDDLE GODS. 89
Then rush together all the forms of Vata
;
To him they come as women to a meeting. With them conjoint, on the same chariot going, Is born the god, the king of all creation. Ne'er sleepeth he when, on his pathway wandering,
.
He goes through air. The friend is hi of waters
;
First-born and holy, — where was he created, And whence arose he ? Spirit of gods is Vata, Source of creation, goeth where he listeth ; Whose sound is heard, but not his form. This Vata Let us with our oblations duly honor.
In times later than the Rig Veda, Vayu interchanges with Indra as representative of the middle sphere ; and in the Rig Veda all the hymns of the family books associate him with
Indra (vii. 90-92 ; iv. 47-48). In the first book he is associated thus in the second hymn; while, ib. 134, he has the only remaining complete hymn, though fragments of songs occasionally are found. All of these hymns except the first two
simply invite Vayu to come with Indra to the sacrifice. It is Vayu who with Indra obtains the first drink of soma (i. 134. 6).
He is spoken of as the artificer's, Tvashtar's, son-in-law, but
the allusion is unexplained (viii. 26. 22); he in turn begets
the storm-gods (i. 134. 4). With Vayu is joined Indra, one of the popular gods. These divinities, which are partly of the middle and partly of the lower sphere, may be called the popular gods, yet were the title 'new gods' neither wholly amiss nor quite correct. For, though the popular deities in general, when compared with many for whom a greater antiquity may be claimed, such as the Sun, Varuna, Dyaus, etc., are of more recent growth in
dignity, yet there remains a considerable number of divinities, the hymns in whose honor, dating from the latest period, seem to show that the power they celebrate had been but lately admitted into the category of those gods that deserved special worship. Consequently new gods would be a misleading term,

as it should be applied to the plainer products of theological, speculation and abstraction rather than to Indra and his peers, not to speak of those newest pantheistic gods, as yet unknown. The designation popular must be understood, then, to apply to the gods most frequently, most enthusiastically revered (for in a stricter sense the sun was also a popular god); and reference
is had in using this word to the greater power and influence of these gods, which is indicated by the fact that the hymns to Agni and Indra precede all others in the family books,
while the Soma-hymns are collected for the most part into one whole book by themselves.
But there is another factor that necessitates a division between the divinities of sun and heaven and the atmospheric and earthly gods which are honored so greatly ; and this
factor is explanatory of the popularity of these gods. In the
case of the older divinities it is the spiritualization of a sole
material appearance that is revered; in the case of the popular gods, the material phenomenon is reduced to a minimum, the
spirituality behind the phenomenon is exalted, and that spiritu
ality stands not in and for itself, but as a part of a union of
spiritualities. Applying this test to the earlier gods the union
will be found to be lacking. The sun's spiritual power is united with Indra's, but the sun is as much a physical phenomenon as a spirituality, and always remains so. On the other hand, the equation of Varunic power with Indraic never amalgamated the two ; and these are the best instances that can be chosen
of the older gods. For in the case of others it is self-evident. Dyaus and Dawn are but material phenomena, slightly spiritualized, but not joined with the spirit-power of others. Many have been the vain attempts to go behind the returns of Vedic hymnology and reduce Indra, Agni, and Soma to terms of a purely naturalistic religion. It cannot be done.
Indra is neither sun, lightning, nor storm ; Agni is neither
hearth-fire nor celestial fire ; Soma is neither planet nor moon.



> INDRA. 91
Each is the transient manifestation of a spirituality lying behind and extending beyond this manifestation. Here alone is the latch-key of the newer, more popular religion. Not merely because Indra was a 'warrior god,' but because Indra and Fire were one ; because of the mystery, not because of the appearance, was he made great at the hands of the priests. It
is true, as has been said above, that the idol of the warriors was magnified because he was such ; but the true cause of the greatness ascribed to him in the hymns lay in the secret of his
nature, as it was lauded by the priest, not in his form, as it was seen by the multitude. Neither came first, both worked together ; but had it not been for the esoteric wisdom held by the priests in connection with his nature, Indra would have gone the way of other meteorological gods ; whereas he became
chiefest of the gods, and, as lord of strength, for a time came nearest to the supreme power.
INDRA.
Indra has been identified with ' storm,' with the ' sky,' with the i
'year'; also with 'sun' and with 'fire' in general.' But if he be taken as he is found in the hymns, it will be noticed at once that- he is too stormy to be the sun ; too luminous to be the storm ; too near to the phenomena of the monsoon to be the year or the sky ; too rainy to be fire ; too alien from every one |
thing to be any one thing. He is too celestial to be wholly
atmospheric ; too atmospheric to be celestial ; too earthly to be either. A most tempting solution is that offered by
Bergaigne, who sees in Indra sun or lightning. Yet does this
explanation not explain all, and it is more satisfactory than
others only because it is • broader ; while it is not yet broad enough. Indra, in Bergaigne's opinion, stands, however, nearer
1 For the different views, see Perry, JAOS. xi. p. 119; Muir, OST. .. p. 77.



92 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
to fire than to sun.' But the savant does not rest content with his own explanation : " Indira est peut-6tre, de tous les dieux
v^diques, celui qui resiste le plus longtemps \ un genre d'analyse qui, appliqud "k la plupart des autres, les rdsout plus
ou moins vite en des personnifications des dldments, soit des
phenomenes naturels, soit du culte " {ibid. p. 167). Dyaus' son, Indra, who rides upon the storm and hurls the lightnings with his hands ; who ' crashes down from heaven
'
and ' destroys the strongholds ' of heaven and earth ; whose greatness 'fills heaven and earth'; whose 'steeds are of red and gold'; who 'speaks in thunder,' and 'is born of waters and cloud'; behind whom ride the storm-gods ; with whom Agni (fire) is inseparably connected ; who ' frees the waters of heaven from the demon,' and 'gives rain-blessings ard wealth'
to man — such a god, granted the necessity of a naturalistic
interpretation, may well be thought to have been lightning itself originally, which the hymns now represent the god as
carrying. But in identifying Indra with the sun there is more
difficulty. In none of the early hymns is this .suggested, and the texts on which Bergaigne relies besides being late are not alwkys conclusive. " Indra clothes himself with the glory of
the sun"; he "sees with the eye of the sun" — such texts prove little when one remembers that the sun is the eye of all the gods, and that to clothe ones'self with solar glory is far from
being one with the sun. In one other, albeit a late verse, the expression 'Indra, a sun,' is used ; and, relying on such texts, Bergaigne claims that Indra is the sun. But it is evident that this is but one of many passages where Indra by implication is compared to the sun ; and comparisons do not indicate allotropy. So, in ii., 11. 20, which Bergaigne gives as a parallel, the words say expressly " Indra [did so and so] like a sun." ^ To rest a building so important on a basis so frail is

INDRA. 93
fortunately rare with Bergaigne. It happens here because he is arguing from the assumption that Indra primitively was a general luminary. Hence, instead of building up Indra from
early texts, he claims a few late phrases as precious confirmation of his theory.^ What was Indra may be seen by comparing a few citations such as might easily be amplified from every book in the Rig Veda. According to the varying fancies of the poets, Indra is armed with stones, clubs, arrows, or the thunderbolt (made for him by the artificer, Tvashtar), of brass or of gold, with many
edges and points. Upon a golden chariot he rides to battle, driving two or many red or yellow steeds ; he is like the sun in brilliancy, and like the dawn in beauty ; he is multiform,
,
and cannot really be described ; his divine name is secret; inappearance he is vigorous, huge ; he is wise and true and kind
;
all treasures are his, and he is a wealth-holder, vast as four
seas ; neither his greatness nor his generosity can be compre
hended ; mightiest of gods is he, filling the universe ; the heavens rest upon his head ; earth cannot hold him ; earth and heaven tremble at his breath ; he is king of all ; the mountains are to him as valleys ; he goes forth a bull, raging, and rushes through the air, whirling up the dust ^ he breaks open the
rain-containing clouds, and lets the rain pour down ; as the.
Agvins restore the light, so he restores the rain ; he is (like)
fire born in three places ; as the giver of rain which feeds, he
creates the plants ; he restores or begets Sun and Dawn (after the storm has passed) ; ^ he creates (in the same way) all things, even heaven and earth; he is associated with Vishnu and Pushan
(the sun-gods), with the A^vins, with the Maruts (storm-gods) as his especial followers, and with the artisan Ribhus. With Varuna he is an Aditya, but he is also associated with another
1 Other citations given by Bergaigne in connection witli this point are all of the
simile class. Only as All-god is Indra the sun. 2 i. 51. 4 : " After slaying Vritra, thou did'st make the sun climb in the sky."



94 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
group of gods, the Vasus (x. 66. 3), as Vasupati, or 'lord of
the Vasus.' He goes with many forms (vi. 47. 18).' The luminous character ^ of Indra, which has caused him to be identified with light-gods, can be understood only when one remembers that in India the rainy season is ushered in by such
displays of lightning that the heavens are often illuminated in
every direction at once ; and not with a succession of flashes, but with contemporaneous ubiquitous sheets of light, so that it
appears as if on all sides of the sky there was one lining of united dazzling flame. When it is said that Indra ' placed light
in light,' one is not to understand, with Bergaigne, that Indra
is identical with the sun, but that in day (light) Indra puts
lightning (x. 54. 6 ; Bergaigne ii. p. 187). Since Indra's lightning^ is a form of fire, there is found in
this union the first mystic dualism of two distinct gods as one. This comes out more in Agni-worship than in Indra-worship, and will be treated below. The snake or dragon killed by Indra is Vritra, the restrainer, who catches and keeps in the
clouds the rain that is falling to earth. He often is called simply the snake, and as the Budhnya Snake, or snake of the cloud-depths, is possibly the Python (= Budh-nya).* - There is
here a touch of primitive belief in an old enemy of man — the serpent ! But the Budhnya Snake has been developed in opposite ways, and has contradictory functions.^
Indra, however, is no more the lightning than he is the sun. One poet says that he is like the sun ;
^ another, that he is like the lightning (viii. 93. 9), which he carries in his arms
1 Adity^, only vii. 85. 4 ; Val. 4. 7. For other references, see Perry {foe. cit.). 2 Bergaigne, ii. 160. 1S7. s Indra finds and begets Agni, iii. 31. 15. * Unless the Python be, rather, the Demon of Putrefaction, as in Iranian belief.
5 Demons of every sort oppose Indra ; Vala, Vritra, the ' holding ' snake {dhi = €;^is), ^ushna ('drought '), etc.
c So he finds and directs the sun and causes it to shine, as explained above (viii. 3. 6; iii. 44. 4 ; i. 56. 4 ; iii. 30. 12). He is praised with Vishnu (vi. 69) in one hymn, as distinct from him.



INDRA. 95
(viii. 12. 7) ; another, that he is like the Hght of dawn (x. 89. 12). So various are the activities, so many the phenomena,
that with him first the seer is obliged to look back of all these phenomena and find in them one person ; and thus he is the most anthropomorphized of the Vedic gods. He is born of heaven or born of clouds (iv. 18), but that his mother is Aditi is not certain. As the most powerful god Indra is again regarded as the All-god (viii. 98. 1-2). With this final supremacy, that distinction between battle-gods and gods sovereign,
which Bergaigne insists upon — the sovereign gods belonging to U7ie conception unitaire de Vordre du monde (iii. p. 3 ; ii.
p. 167) — fades away. As Varuna became gradually greatest, so did Indra in turn. But Varuna was a philosopher's god, not a warrior's ; and Varuna was not double and mystical. So even the priest (Agni) leaves Varuna, and with the warrior takes more pleasure in his twin Indra ; of him making an Allgod, a greatest god. Varuna is passive ; Indra is energetic ; but Indra does not struggle for his lordship. Inspired by soma, he smites, triumphs, punishes. Victor already, he descends upon his enemies and with a blow destroys them. It is rarely that
he feels the effect of battle ; he never doubts its issue. There is evidence that this supremacy was not gained with
out contradiction, and the novelty of the last extravagant Indraworship may be deduced, perhaps, from such passages as viii. 96. 15 ; and 100. 3, where are expressed doubts in regard
to the existence of a real Indra. How late is the worship of
the popular Indra, and that it is not originality that causes his hymns to be placed early in each collection, may be judged from the fact that only of Indra (and Agni ?) are there idols : viii. I. 5; iv. 24. 10 : "Who gives ten cows for my Indra? When he has slain his foe let (the purchaser) give him to me again." ^ Thus it happens that one rarely finds such poems
1 BoUensen would see an alluiiion to idols in i. 145. 4-5 (to Agni), but this is very doubtful (ZDMG. xlvii. p. 586). Agni, however, is on a par with Indra, so that the exception would have no significance. See Kaegi, Rig Veda, note 79 a.



96 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
to Indra as to Dawn and to other earlier deities, but almost
always stereotyped descriptions of prowess, and mechanical invitations to come to the altar and reward the hymn-maker. There are few of Indra's many hymns that do not smack of soma and sacrifice. He is a warrior's god exploited by priests ;
as popularly conceived, a sensual giant, friend, brother, helper
of man. One example of poetry, instead of ritualistic verse
making to Indra, has been translated in the introductory
chapter. Another, which, if not very inspiring, is at least free
from obvious soma-'^ox^v^ — which results in Indra being in
voked chiefly to come and drink — is as follows (vi. 30) :
Great hath he grown, Indra, for deeds heroic ; Ageless is he alone, alone gives riches ; Beyond the heaven and earth hath Indra stretched him, The half of him against both worlds together
!
So high and great I deem his godly nature
;
What he hath stablished there is none impairs it. Day after day a sun is he conspicuous, And, wisely strong, divides the wide dominions. To-day and now (thou makest) the work of rivers. In that, O Indra, thou hast hewn them pathway. The hills have bowed them down as were they comrades; By thee, O wisely strong, are spaces fastened. 'T is true, like thee, O Indra, is no other. Nor god nor mortal is more venerable. Thou slew'st the dragon that the flood encompassed, Thou didst let out the waters to the ocean. Thou didst the waters free, the doors wide opening, » Thou, Indra, brak'st the stronghold of the mountains, Becamest king of all that goes and moveth, Begetting sun and heaven and dawn together.
THE MARUTS.
These gods, the constant followers of Indra, from the present point of view are not of great importance, except as showing an unadulterated type of nature-gods, worshipped without much

esoteric wisdom (although there is a certain amount of mystery in connection witli their birth). There is something of the same pleasure in singing to them as is discernible in the hymns
to Dawn. They are the real storm-gods, following Rudra, their
father, and accompanying the great storm-bringer, Indra. Their mother is the variegated cow Prigni, the mother cloud. Their name means the shining, gleaming ones.
Hymn to the Maruts (vii. 56. i-io).
Who, sooth, are the gleaming related heroes, the glory of Rudra, on beauteous chargers ? For of them the birthplace no man hath witnessed ; they only know it, their mutual birthplace. With wings expanded they sweep each other,i and strive together, the wind-loud falcons. Wise he that knoweth this secret knowledge, that Prifni the great one to them was mother.^ This folk the Maruts shall make heroic, victorious ever, increased in manhood ; In speed the swiftest, in light the lightest,
with grace united and fierce in power Your power fierce is ; your strength, enduring; and hence with the Maruts this folk is mighty. Your fury fair is, your hearts are wrothful, like maniacs wild is your band courageous. From us keep wholly the gleaming lightning ; . let not your anger come here to meet us. Your names of strong ones endeared invoke I,
that these delighted may joy, O Maruts.
What little reflection or moral significance is in the Marut
hymns is illustrated by i. 38. 1-9, thus translated by Miiller :
What then now ? When will ye take us as a dear father takes his son
by both hands, O ye gods, for whom the sacred grass has been trimmed ?
1 Or 'pluck with beaks,' as Miiller translates, SBE. xxxii. p. 373. 2 " Bore them " (gave an udder). In v. 52. 16 Rudra is father and Pri5ni, mother. Compare viii. 94. i : " The cow . . . the mother of the Maruts, sends milk (rain)." In X. 78. 6 the Maruts are sons of Sindhu (Indus).



98 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Where now ? On what errand of yours are you going, in heaven, not on earth ? Where are your cows sporting ? Where are your newest favors, O Maruts ? Where are blessings ? Where all delights ? If you, sons of Pri9ni, were mortals and your praiser an immortal, then never should your praiser be unwelcome, like a deer in pasture grass, nor should he go on the path of Yama.i Let not one sin after another, difficult to be conquered, overcome us ; may it depart, together with greed. Truly they are terrible and powerful ; even to the desert the Rudriyas bring rain that is never dried up. The lightning lows like a cow, it follows as a mother followsafter her young, when the shower has been let loose. Even by day the Maruts create darkness with the water-bearing cloud, when they drench the earth, etc.
The number of the Maruts was originally seven, afterwards
raised to thrice, seven, and then given variously,^ sometimes
as high as thrice sixty. They are the servants, the bulls of Dyaus, the glory of Rudra (or perhaps the ' boys of Rudra '), divine, bright as suns, blameless and pure. They cover themselves with shining adornment, chains of gold, gems, and tur
bans. On their heads are helmets of gold, and in their hands gleam arrows and daggers. Like heroes rushing to battle, they stream onward. They are fair as deer ; their roar is like that of lions. The mountains bow before them, thinking them
selves to be valleys, and the hills bow down. Good warriors
and good steeds are their gifts. They smite, they kill, they
rend the rocks, they strip the trees like caterpillars ; they rise
together, and, like spokes in a wheel, are united in strength. Their female companion is Rodasi (lightning, from the same
root as rudra, the 'red'). They are like wild boars, and (like
the sun) they have metallic jaws. On' their chariots are speckled hides ; like birds they spread their wings ; they strive
in flight with each other. Before them the earth sways like
a ship. They dance upon their path. Upon their chests for beauty's sake they bind gold armor. From the heavenly udder

they milk down rain. " Tlirough whose wisdom, through whose design do they come ? " cries the poet. They have no real adversary. The kings of the forest they tear asunder, and make tremble even the rocks. Their music is heard on every side.^
RUDRA.
The father of the Maruts, Rudra, is ' the ruddy one,' par excellence, and so to him is ascribed paternity of the ' ruddy ones.' But while Indra has a plurality of hymns, Rudra has
but few, and these it is not of special importance to cite. The features in each case are the same. The Maruts remain as gods whose function causes them to be invoked chiefly that they may spare from the fury of the tempest. This idea is in Rudra's case carried out further, and he is specially called on to avert (not only ' cow-slaying ' and ' man-slaying ' by lightning,^ but
also) disease, pestilence, etc. Hence is he preeminently, on the one hand, the kindly god who averts disease, and, on the other, of destruction in every form. From him Father Manu
got wealth and health, and he is the fairest of beings, but,
more, he is the strongest god (ii. 33. 3, 10). From such a
prototype coihes the later god of healing and woe — Rudra, who becomes Qiva.^
RAIN-GODS.
There is one rather mechanical hymn directed to the Waters themselves as goddesses, where Indra is the god who gives them passage. But in the unique hymn to the Rivers it is Varuna who, as general god of water, is represented as their
patron. In the first hymn the rain-water is meant.* A descrip

V. 54. 6 ; i. 85. 8 ; viii. 7. 34 ; v. 59. 2. 2 He carries -lightnings and medicines together in vii. 46. 3. 3 Civa is later identified with Rudra. For the latter in RV. compare i. 43 ; 114, 1-5, 10 ; li. 33. 2-13. * vii. 47, and x. 75.



100 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
tion in somewhat jovial vein of the joy produced by the rain after long drought forms the subject matter of another lyric (less an hymn than a poem), which serves to illustrate the position of the priests at the end of this Vedic collection. The
frogs are jocosely compared to priests that have fulfilled their vow of silence ; and their quacking is likened to the noise of students learning the Veda. Parjanya is the god that, in dis
tinction from Indra as the first cause, actually pours dov/n the
rain-drops,
The Frogs.i
As priests that have their vows fulfilled, Reposing for a year complete,
The frogs have now begun to talk, Parjanya has their voice aroused.
When down the heavenly waters come upon him. Who like a dry bag lay within the river. Then, like the cows' loud lowing (cows that calves have), The vocal sound of frogs comes all together.
When on the longing, thirsty ones it raineth, (The rainy season having come upon them), Then akkala !
'^ Xhey cry; and one the other Greets with his speech, as sons address a father.
The one the other welcomes, and together They both rejoice at falling of the waters ; The spotted frog hops when the rain has wet him, And with his yellow comrade joins his utterance.
When one of these the other's voice repeateth. Just as a student imitates his teacher, Then like united members with fair voices. They all together sing among the waters.
1 vii. 103. 2 Akhkhala is like Latin eccere^ a shout of joy and wonder {^Atn, J. Phil. XIV. p. 11).



RAIN-GODS. 101
One like an ox doth bellow, goat-like one bleats ; Spotted is one, and one of them is yellow

Alike in name, but in appearance different. In many ways the voice they, speaking, vary.

(Like) priests ^\o soma have, they raise their voices. And pray the prayer that once a year is uttered

The sacred order of the (year) twelve-membered. These heroes guard, and never do neglect it
;
When every year, the rainy season coming. The burning heat receiveth its dismission.^
In one hymn no less than four gods are especially invoked
for rain — Agni, Brihaspati, Indra, and Parjanya. The two
first are sacrificially potent ; Brihaspati, especially, gives to the priest the song that has power to bring rain ; he comes either 'as Mitra-Varuna or Pushan,' and 'lets Parjanya rain'; while in the same breath Indra is exhorted to send a flood of rain,

rains which are here kept back by the gods,'' — and Agni is immediately afterwards asked to perform the same favor, apparently as an analogue to the streams of oblation which the priest pours on the fire. Of these gods, the pluvius is Parjanya:
1 Literally, ' that has stood over-night,' i.e.. fermented. 2 To this hymn is added, in imitation of the laudations of generous benefactors, which are sometimes suffixed to an older hymn, words ascribing gifts to the frogs. Bergaigne regards the frogs as meteorological phenomena ! It is from this hymn as a starting-point proceed the latter-day arguments of Jacobi, who would prove the 'period of the Rig Veda 'to have begun about 3500 B.C. One might as well date Homer by an appeal to the Batrachomyomachia.
8 X. 98. 6.



102 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Parjanya loud extol in song, The fructifying son of heaven ; May he provide us pasturage ! He who the fruitful seed of plants, Of cows and mares and women forms, He is the god Parjanya. For him the melted butter pour
In (Agni's) mouth, — a honeyed sweet,

And may he constant food bestow ! ^
This god is the rain-cloud personified,^ but he is scarcely to
be distinguished, in other places, from Indra ; although the
latter, as the greater, newer god, is represented rather as causing the rain to flow, while Parjanya pours it down. Like Varuna, Parjanya also upsets a water-barrel, and wets the
earth. He is identical with the Slavic Perkuna.
For natural expression, vividness, energy, and beauty, - the following hymn is unsurpassed. As a god unjustly driven out of the pantheon, it is, perhaps, only just that he should be
exhibited, in contrast to the tone of the sacrificial hymnlet above, in his true light. Occasionally he is paired with Wind; and in the curious tendency of the poets to dualize their divinities, the two become a compound, Parjanyavcitd (" Parjanya and Vata"). There is, also, vii. loi, one mystic hymn to
Parjanya. The following, v. 83, breathes quite a different spirit :
^
Greet him, the mighty one, with these laudations, Parjanya praise, and call him humbly hither; With roar and rattle pours the bull his waters. And lays his seed in all the plants, a foetus.
He smites the trees, and smites the evil demons, too
;
While every creature fears before his mighty blow. E'en he that hath not sinned, from this strong god retreats, When smites Parjanya, thundering, those that evil do.
1 vii. 102. 2 Compare Biihler, Orient and Occident, i. p. 222. 3 This hymn is another of those that contradict the first assumption of the ritualists. From internal evidence it is not likely that it was made for baksheesh.



RAIN-GODS. 103
As when a charioteer with whip his horses strikes, So drives he to the fore his messengers of rain
;
Afar a lion's roar is raised abroad, whene'er Parjanya doth create the rain-containing cloud. Now forward rush the winds, now gleaming lightnings fall
;
Up spring the plants, and thick becomes the shining sky. For every living thing refreshment is begot, Whene'er Par] an ya's seed makes quick the womb of earth.
Beneath whose course the earth hath bent and bowed her, Beneath whose course the (kine) behoofed bestir them. Beneath whose course the plants stand multifarious,
He — thou, Parjanya — grant us great protection I Bestow Dyaus' rain upon us, O ye Maruts ! Make thick the stream that comes from that strong stallion I With this thy thunder come thou onward, hither. Thy waters pouring, a spirit and our father.^ Roar forth and thunder ! Give the seed of increase I Drive with thy chariot full of water round us ; The water-bag drag forward, loosed, turned downward
;
Let hills and valleys equal be before thee
!
Up with tlie mighty keg ! then pour it under
!
Let all the loosened streams flow swiftly forward ; Wet heaven and earth with this thy holy fluid ;" And fair drink may it be for all our cattle
!
When thou with rattle and with roar, Parjanya, thundering, sinners slayest. Then all before thee do rejoice. Whatever creatures live on earth.
Rain hast thou rained, and now do thou restrain it
;
The desert, too, hast thou made fit for travel
;
The plants hast thou begotten for enjoyment ; And wisdom hast thou found for thy descendants.
The different meters may point to a collection of small hymns. It is to be observed that Parjanya is here the father

104 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
god (of men) ; he is the Asura, the Spirit ; and rain comes from the Shining Sky (Dyaus). How like Varuna ! The rain, to the poet, descends from the sky, and is liable
to be caught by the demon, Vritra, whose rain-swollen belly
Indra opens with a stroke, and lets fall the rain ; or, in the
older view just presented, Parjanya makes the cloud that gives
the rain — a view united with the descent of rain from the sky (Dyaus). With Parjanya as an Aryan rain-god may be mentioned Trita, who, apparently, was a water-god, Aptya, in general ; and some of whose functions Indra has taken. He appears to be the same with the Persian Thraetaona Athwya ; but
in the Rig Veda he is interesting mainly as a dim survival of the past.* The washing out of sins, which appears to be
the original conception of Varuna's sin-forgiving,^ finds an
analogue in the fact that sins are cast off upon the innocent
waters and upon Trita — also a water-god, and once identified with Varuna (viii. 41. 6). But this notion is so unique and
late (only in viii. 47) that Bloomfield is perhaps right in imputing it to the [later] moralizing age of the Brahmanas, with which the third period of the Rig Veda is quite in touch.
1 Some suppose even Indra to be one with the Avestan Andra, a demon, which is possible. 2 Otherwise it is the ' bonds of sin ' which are broken or loosed, as in the last verse of the first Varuna hymn, translated above. But the two views may be of equal antiquity (above, p. 65, note). On Trita compare JRAS. 1893, P- 4'9i PAOS. 1S94 (Bloomfield).



CHAPTER V.
THE RIG VEDA (CONTINUED) . — THE lOWER GODS.
AGNI.
Great are the heavenly gods, but greater is Indra, god of the atmosphere. Greatest are Agni and Soma, the gods of earth.
Agni is the altar-fire. Originally fire, Agni, in distinction
from sun and lightning, is the fire of sacrifice ; and as sflch is
he great. One reads in v. 3. 1-2, that this Agni is Varuna,
Indra; that in him are all the gods. This is, indeed, formally a late view, and can be paralleled only by a few passages of a comparatively recent period. Thus, in the late hymn i. 164. 46 : " Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, they say ; he is the sun (the
bird in the sky) ; that which is but one they call variously," etc. ,
So X. 114. 5 and the late passage iii. 38. 7, have reference to various forms of Agni. Indra had a twofold nature in producing the union of lightning and Agni ; and this made liim mysteriously great. But
in Agni is found the first triality, which, philosophically,
is interpreted as a trinity. The fire of the altar is one with
the lightning, and, again, one with the sun. This is Agni's threefold birth ; and all the holy character of three is
exhausted in application where he is concerned. It is the highest mystery until the very end of the Vedic age. This
Agni it is that is the real Agni of the Rig Veda — the new 4gni ; for there was probably an Agni cult (as simple fire) long before the soma cult. Indra and Agni are one, and both are called the slayers of the demons.^ They are both united as an
indissoluble pair (iii. 12, etc.). Agni, with, perhaps, the

106 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA,
exception of Soma, is the most important god in the Rig Veda; and it is no chance that gives him the first place in each family hymn-book; for in him are found, only in more fortunate circumstances, exactly the same conditions as obtain in the case
of Indra. He appealed to man as the best friend among divine
beings ; he was not far off, to be wondered at ; if terrible, to be
propitiated. He was near and kind to friends. And as he seemed to the vulgar so he appealed to the theosophy which permeates the spirit of the poets ; for he is mysterious ; a mediator between god and man (in carrying to heaven the
offerings) ; a threefold unity, typical of earth, atmosphere, and
heaven. From this point of view, as in the case of Indra, so
in the case of Agni, only to a greater extent, it becomes impossible to interpret Agni' as one element, one phenomenon.
There is, when a distinction is made, an agni which is single, the altar-fire, separate from other fires ; but it is seldom that
Agni is not felt as the threefold one.
And now for the interpretation of the modern ritualists. The Hindu ritual had ' the three fires,' which every orthodox
believer was taught to keep up. The later literature of the
Hindus themselves very correctly took these three fires as types of the three forms of Agni known in the Rig Veda. But
to the ritualists the historical precedence is inverted, and they would show that the whole Vedic mythological view of an Agni triad is the result of identifying Agni with the three fires
of the ritual. From this crass method of interpretation it would result that all Vedic mythology was the child of the
liturgy.'
1 On this point Bergaigne deprecates tlie application of the ritualistic method, and says in words that cannot be too emphasized : " Mais qui ne voit que de telles explications n'expliquent rien, on plutot qiie le detail du ritucl ne pent trouver son explication que dans le mythe, Men loin de pouvoir servir lui-memes ^ expliquer le mythe ? . . . Ni le ciel seul ni la terre seule, mais la terre et le ciel etroitement unis et presque confondus, voilk le vrai domaine de la mythologie v^dique, mythologie dont le rituel n'est que la reproduction" (i. p. 24).



AGNI. 107
As earthly fire Agni is first ignis :^ "Driven by the wind,
he hastens through the forest with roaring tongues. . . . black is thy path, O bright immortal ! " " He mows down, as
no herd can do, the green fields ; bright his tooth, and golden
his beard." '' He devours like a steer that one has tied up."
This is common fire, divine, but not of the altar. The latter Agni is of every hymn. For instance, the first stanza of the Rig Veda: "Agni, the family priest, I worship; the divine
priest of sacrifice ; the oblation priest, who bestows riches," where he is invoked under the names of different priests. But
Agni is even more than this ; he is the fire (heat) that causes production and reproduction, visibly manifest in the sun. This
dual Agni, it is to be noticed, is at times the only Agni recog
nized. The third form is then added, lightning, and therewith Agni is begotten of Indra, and is, therefore, one with Indra: "There is only one fire lighted in many places" (Val.
lo. 2). As a poetical expression, Agni in the last form is the
' Son of Waters,' an epithet not without significance in philo
sophical speculation ; for water, through all periods, was re
garded as the material origin of the universe. Agni is one with the sun, with lightning (and thunder), and
descends into the plants.^ To man he is house-priest and friend. It is he that has " grouped men in dwelling-places " (iii. I. 17) like Prometheus, in whose dialectic name, Proman
theus, lingers still the fire-creator, the twirling {math) sticks which make fire in the wood. He is man's guest and best
friend (Mitra, iv. i. 9; above). An hymn or two entire will show what was Agni to the
Vedic poet. In the following, the Rig Veda's first hymn, he is addressed, in the opening stanza, under the names of house
priest, the chief sacrificial priest, and the priest that pours obla
tions. In the second stanza he is extolled as the messenger

who brings the gods to the sacrifice, himself rising up in
sacrificial flames, and forming a link between earth and
heaven. In a later stanza he is called the Messenger (Angiras
=

To Agni (i. i).
I worship Agni ; house-priest, he, And priest divine of sacrifice, Th' oblation priest, who giveth wealth.
Agni, by seers of old adored,
To be adored by those to-day May he the gods bring here to us.
Through Agni can one wealth acquire. Prosperity from day to day. And fame of heroes excellent.
O, Agni ! whatsoe'er the rite That thou surround'st on every side, That sacrifice attains the gods;
May Agni, who oblation gives
The wisest, true, most famous priest This god with (all) the gods approach !
Thou doest good to every man That serves thee, Agni ; even this Is thy true virtue, Angiras.
To thee, O Agni, day by day. Do we with prayer at eve and dawn, Come, bringing lowly reverence
;
To thee, the lord of sacrifice. And shining guardian of the rite,i In thine own dwelling magnified.
As if a father to his son, Be easy of access to us. And lead us onward to our weal.

AGNI. 109
This is mechanical enough to have been made for an estab
lished ritual, as doubtless it was. But it is significant that the
ritualistic gods are such that to give their true character hymns of this sort must be cited. Such is not the case with the older gods of the pantheon. Ritualistic as it is, however,
it is simple. Over against it may be set the following (vi. 8)
:
" Now will I praise the strength of the variegated red bull (Agni), the feasts of the Knower-of-beings ^ (Agni) ; to Agni, the friend of all men, is poured out a new song, sweet to him as clear soma. As soon as he was born in highest heaven, Agni began to protect laws, for he is a guardian of law (or order). Great in strength, he, the friend of all men, measured out the space between heaven and earth, and in greatness touched the zenith ; he, the marvellous friend, placed apart heaven and earth ; with light removed darkness ; separated the two worlds like skins. Friend of all men, he took all might to himself. ... In the waters' lap the mighty ones (gods) took him, and people established him king. Matarigvan, mes
senger of the all-shining one, bore him from afar, friend of all men. Age by age, O Agni, give to poets new glorious wealth
for feasts. O ever-youthful king, as if with a ploughshare,
rend the sinner ; destroy him with thy flame, like a tree ! But among our lords bring, O Agni, power unbent, endless strength of heroes ; and may we, through thy assistance, conquer wealth an hundredfold, a thousandfold, O Agni, thou friend of all ;
with thy sure protection protect our royal lords, O helper, thou who hast three habitations ; guard for us the host of them
that have been generous, and let them live on, friend of all,
now that thou art lauded." Aryan, as Kuhn ^ has shown, is at least the conception if not
the particular form of the legend alluded to in this hymn, of fire brought from the sky to earth, which Promethean act is
1 Or ' Finder-of-beings.' 2 Herabkimft des Feuers und des Gottertrankcs.



110 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
attributed elsewhere to the fire-priest.* Agni is here Mitra, the friend, as sun-god, and as such takes all the celestials' activities on himself. Like Indra he also gives personal strength : " Fair is thy face, O Agni, to the mortal that de
sires strength ; — they whom thou dost assist overcome their enemies all their lives" (vi. i6. 25, 27). Agni is drawn down

to earth by means of the twirling-sticks, one the father, one the mother.^ "The bountiful wood bore the fair variegated son of waters and plants ; ^ the gods united in mind, and payed homage to the glorious mighty child when he was born " (iii. I. 13). As the son of waters, Agni loves wood but retreats to
water, and he is so identified with Indra that he ' thunders
'
and 'gives rain' (as lightning; ii. 6. 5; iii. 9. 2). The deeper significance of Agni-worship is found not alone in the fact that he is the god in whom are the other gods, nor in that he is the sun alone, but that " I am Agni, immor
tality is in my mouth ; threefold my light, eternal fire, my
name fhe oblation (fire)," iii. 26. 7. He is felt as a mysterious
trinity. As a sun he lights earth ; and gives life, sustenance,
children, and wealth (iii. 3. 7) ; as lightning he destroys, as
fire he befriends ; like Indra he gives victory (iii. 16. i) ; like
Varuna he releases the bonds of sin ; he is Varuna's brother
(v. 2. 7 ; vi. 3. i; iv. i. 2); his 'many names' are often
alluded to (iii. 20. 3, and above). The ritualistic interpreta
tion of the priest is that the sun is only a sacrificial fire above
lighted by the gods as soon as the corresponding fire is
lighted on earth by men (vi. 2.3). He is all threefold ; three
his tongues, his births, his places ; thrice led about fhe sacri
fice given thrice a day (iii. 2.9; 17. i ; 20. 2 ; iv. 15. 2 ;
1 RV. vi. 16. 13 : " Thee, Agni, from out the sky Atharvan twirled," nir amanthata (cf. Promantheus). In x. 462 the Bhrigus, 0Xe7i)at, discover fire. 2 Conipare v. 2. i. Sometimes Agni is "born with the fingers," which twirl the sticks (iii. 26. 3 ; iv. 6. 8). 3 Compare ii. i : "born in flame from water, cloud, and plants . . . thou art the .creator."

I. 7; 12. i). He is the upholder of the religious order, the guest o£ mortals, found by the gods in the heavenly waters ; he is near and dear ; but he also becomes dreadful to the foe
(iii. I. 3-6 ; 6. s ; vi. 7. I ; 8. 2 ; iii. 1. 23 ; 22. 5 ; vi. 3. 7; iii.
18. i; iv. 4. 4 ; I. 6).
It is easy to see that in such a conception of a triune god, who is fearful yet kind, whose real name is unknown, while his visible manifestations are in earth, air, and heaven, whose
being contains all the gods, there is an idea destined to over
throw, as it surpasses, the simpler conceptions of the naturalism that precedes it. Agni as the one divine power of creation
is in fact the origin of the human race : " From thee come
singers and heroes " (vi. 7. 3). The less weight is, therefore,
to be laid on Bergaigne's ' fire origin of man ' ; it is not as
simple fire, but as universal creator that Agni creates man ; it
is not the ' fire-principle '
' philosophically elicited from con
nection of fire and water, but as god-principle, all-creative,
that Agni gets this praise. Several hymns are dedicated to Indragnl, Indra united with
Agni ; and the latter even is identified with Dyaus (iv. i. 10),
this obsolescent god reviving merely to be absorbed into Agni.
As water purifies from dirt and sin (Varuna), so fire purifies
(iv. 12. 4). It has been suggested on account of v. 12. 5 : ' Those that were yours have spoken lies and left thee,' that
there is a decrease in Agni worship. As this never really happened, and as the words are merely those of a penitent
who has lied and seeks forgiveness at the hands of the god of
1 Bergaigne, i. p. 32 ff. The question of priestly names {loc. cit. pp. 47-50), should start with Bharata as TTvp^iSpos, a common title of Agni (ii. 7; vi. 16. 19-21). So Bhrigu is the 'shining' one; and Vasishtha is the 'most shining' (compare Vasus, not good but shining gods). The priests got their names from their god, like Jesuits. Compare Gritsamada in the Bhrigu family (book ii.) ; Visva-mitra, 'friend of all,' in the Bharata family (book iii.) ; Gautama Vamadeva belonging to Angirasas (book iv.); Atri 'Eater,' epithet of Agni in RV. (book v.) ; Bharadvaja 'bearing food' (book vi.) ; Vasishtha (book vii.) ; and besides these Jamadagni and Kagyapa, ' blacktoothed (Agni).'



112 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
truth, the suggestion is not very acceptable. Agni comprehends not only all naturalistic gods, but such later femininities as Reverence, Mercy, and other abstractions, including Boundlessness. Of how great importance was the triune god Agni may be seen by comparing his three lights with the later sectarian
trinity, where Vishnu, originally the sun, and (Rudra) Qiva,
the lightning, are the preserver and destroyer. We fear the reader may have thought that we were developing rather a system of mythology than a history of religion.
With the close of the Vedic period we shall have less to say from a mythological point of view, but we think that it will have become patent now for what purpose was intended the
myth'olog'ical basis of our study. Without this it would have been impossible to trace the gradual growth in the higher
met aplrysical interpretation of nature which goes hand in hand with the deeper^religious sense. With this object we have proceeded from the simpler to the more complex divinities. We have now to take up a side of religion which lies more
apart from speculation, but it is concerned very closely with
man's religious instincts — the worship of Bacchic character,
the reverence for and fear of the death-god, and the eschatological fancies of the poets, together with those first attempts at creating a new theosophy which close the period of the Rig Veda. SOMA.
Inseparably connected with the worship of Indra and Agni is that of the 'moon-plant,' soma, the intoxicating personified drink to whose deification must be assigned a date earlier than that of the Vedas themselves. For the soma of the Hindus is etymologically identified with the haoma of the Persians (the
o/i(i);u,t of Plutarch),^ and the cultus at least was begun before
1 De Isid. et Osir. 46. Compare Windischmann, Ucber den Samacultus der Arier (1846), and Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. ii. p. 471. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mylhologie, i. p. 450, believes haoma to mean the moon, as does sotna in some hymns of the Rig Veda (see below).



SOMA. 113
ths separation of the two nations, since in each the plant is
regarded as a god. The inspiring effect of intoxication seemed to be due to the inherent divinity of tlie plant that produced
it ; the plant was, therefore, regarded as divine, and the preparation of the draught was looked upon as a sacred ceremony.^
This offering of the juice of the soma-^\z.nt in India was performed thrice daily. It is said in the Rig Veda that soma grows upon the mountain Mujavat, that its or his father is Parjanya, the rain-god, and that the waters are his sisters.^ From this mountain, or from the sky, accounts differ, soma was brought by a hawk.' He is himself represented in other places as a bird ; and as a divinity he shares in the praise given to Indra, " who helped Indra to slay Vritra," the demon that keeps back the rain. Indra, intoxicated by soma, does his great deeds, and indeed all the gods depend on soma for immortality. Divine, a weapon-bearing god, he often simply takes the place of Indra and other gods in Vedic eulogy. It is the god Soma himself who slays Vritra, Soma who overthrows cities. Soma who begets the gods, creates the sun, up
holds the sky, prolongs life, sees all things, and is the one best
friend of god and man, the divine drop (jnclu), the friend of
Indra.* As a god he is associated not only with Indra, but also with Agni, Rudra, and Pushan. A few passages in the later portion of the Rig Veda show that soma already was identified with the
moon before the end of this period. After this the lunar yellow

114 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
god regularly was regarded as the visible and divine Soma of
heaven, represented on earth by the plant.^ From the fact that Soma is the moon in later literature, and undoubtedly is recognized as such in a small number of the latest passages of the Rig Veda, the not unnatural irjference has been drawn by some Vedic scholars that Soma, in hymns
still earlier, means the moon ; wherever, in fact, epithets hitherto supposed to refer to the plant may be looked upon as not incompatible with a description of the moon, there these
epithets are to be referred directly to Soma as the moon-god, not to S07na, the mere plant. Thus, with Rig Veda, x. 85 (a late hymn, which speaks of Soma as the moon " in the lap of the stars," and as "the days' banner") is to be compared
vi. 39. 3, where it is said that the drop (soma) lights up the
dark nights, and is the day's banner. Although this expression,
at first view, would seem to refer to the moon alone, yet it may possibly be regarded as on a par with the extravagant praise
given elsewhere to the soma--pla.nt, and not be so significant of the moon as it appears to be. Thus, in another passage of the same book, the soma, in similar language, is said to " lay light in the sun," a phrase scarcely compatible with the moon's
sphere of activity."
The decision in regard to this question of interpretation is not to be reached so easily as one might suppose, considering that a whole book, the ninth, of the Rig Veda is dedicated to Soma, and that in addition to this there are many hymns addressed to him in the other books. For in the greater number of passages which may be cited for and against this theory the objector may argue that the generally extravagant praise bestowed upon Soma through the Veda is in any one case
1 A complete account of soma as given by the Vedic texts will be found in Hillebrandt's Vedische Mythologie, vol. i., where are described the different ways of fermenting the juice of the plant. 2 Although so interpreted by Hillebrandt, loc. cH. p. 312. The passage is found in RV. vi. 44. 23.



SOMA. 115
merely particularized, and that it is not incongruous to say of the divine jwza-plant, "he lights the dark nights," when one
reads in general that he creates all things, including the gods. On the other hand, the advocate of the theory may reply that everything which does not apply to the moon-god Soma may be used metaphorically of him. Thus, where it is said, " Soma
goes through the purifying sieve," by analogy with the drink of the plant so?na passing through the sieve the poet may be supposed to imagine the moon passing through the sieve-like
clouds ; and even when this sieve is expressly called the
' sheep's-tail sieve' and 'wool-sieve,' this may still be, meta
phorically, the cloud-sieve (as, without the analogy, one speaks to-day of woolly clouds and the ' mare's tail '). So it happens that, with an hundred hymns addressed to Soma, it remains still a matter of discussion whether the soma addressed be the plant or the moon. Alfred Hillebrandt, to whom is due the problem in its present form, declares that everywhere ^ in the Rig Veda Soma means the moon. No
better hymn can be found to illustrate the difficulty under
which labors the soma-e.-x.e.ge.t& than ix. 15, from which Hillebrandt takes the fourth verse as conclusive evidence that by
soma only the moon is meant. In that case, as will be seen from the 'pails,' it must be supposed that the poet leaps from Soma to sojna without warning. Hillebrandt does not include
the mention of the pails in his citation ; but in this, as in other
doubtful cases, it seems to us better to give a whole passage than to argue on one or two verses torn from their proper
position
:
Hymn to Soma (ix. 15).
Query : Is the hymn addressed to the plant as it is pressed out into the pails, or
to the moon ?
I. This one, by means of prayer (or intelligence), comes through the fine (sieve), the hero, with swift car, going to the meeting with Indra.
1 Loc. cit. pp. 340, 450.



116 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
2. This one thinks much for the sublime assembly of gods, where sit immortals.
3. This one is despatched and led upon a shining path, when the active ones urge (him).i
4. This one, shaking his horns, sharpens (them), -the bull of the herd, doing heroic deeds forcibly.
5. This one hastens, the strong steed, with bright golden beams, becoming of streams the lord.
6. This one, pressing surely through the knotty (sieve ?) to good things, comes down into the vessels.
7. This one, fit to be prepared, the active ones prepare in the pails, as he creates great food.
8. Him, this one, who has good weapons, who is most intoxicating, ten fingers and seven (or many) prayers prepare.
Here, as in ix. 70, Hillebrandt assumes that the poet turns suddenly from the moon to the plant. Against this might be urged the use of the same pronoun .throughout the hymn.
It must be confessed that at first sight it is almost as difficult
to have the plant, undoubtedly meant in verses 7 and 8, represented by the moon in the preceding verses, as i^ is not to see the moon in the expression ' shaking his horns.' This phrase occurs in another hymn, where Hillebrandt, with 'the same certainty as he does here, claims it for the moon, though the
first part of this hymn as plainly refers to the plant, ix. 70.
I, 4. Here the plant is a steer roaring like the noise of the
Maruts (5-6), and then (as above, after the term steer is applied to the plant), it is said that he 'sharpens his horns,'
and is 'sightly,' and further, 'he sits down in the fair place
... on the wooly back,' etc., which bring one to still an
other hymn where are to be found like expressions, used, evi
dently, not of the moon, but of the plant, viz., to ix. 37, a hymn not cited by Hillebrandt
:
^ Compare ix. 79. 5, where the same verb is used of striking, urging out the somajuice, rasa.



SOMA. 117
This strong "(virile) soma^ pressed for drinli, flows into tlie purifying vessel ; this sightly (as above, where Hillebrandt says it is epithet of the moon), yellow, fiery one, is flowing into the purifying vessel ; roaring into its own place (as above). This strong one, clear, shining (or purifying itself), runs through the shining places of the sky, slaying evil demons, through the sheep-hair-sieve. On the back of Trita this one shining (of purifying itself) made bright the sun with (his) sisters.^ This one, slaying Vritra, strong, pressed out, finding good things (as above), uninjured, soma, went as if for booty. This god, sent forth by seers, runs into the vessels, the drop (mdu) for Indra, quickly (or willingly).
So far as we can judge, after comparing these and the other
passages that are cited by Hillebrandt as decisive for a lunar interpretation of soma, it seems quite as probable that the epithets and expressions used are employed of the plant metaphorically as that tne poet leaps thus lightly from plant to moon. And there is a number of cases which plainly enough
are indicative of the plant alone to make it improbable that Hillebrandt is correct in taking Soma as the moon 'everywhere in the Rig Veda.' It may be that the moon-cult is somewhat older than has been supposed, and that the language is consciously veiled in the ninth book to cover the worship
of a deity as yet only partly acknowledged as such. But it is almost inconceivable that an hundred hymns should praise the moon ; and all the native commentators, bred as they were in the belief of their day that soma and the moon were one, should not know that soma in the Rig Veda (as well as later) means the lunar deity. It seems, therefore, safer to abide by the belief that soma usually means what it was understood to mean, and what the general descriptions in the soma-hjmr\s
more or less clearly indicate, viz., the intoxicating plant, con
ceived of as itself divine, stimulating Indra, and, therefore,
the caiisa movens of the demon's death, Indra being the causa
efficiens. Even the allusions to soma being in the sky is not
1 Compare ix. 32. 2, where " Trita's maidens urge on the golden steed with the press-stones, iiidu as a drink for Indra."



118 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
incompatible with this. For he is carried thence from the
place of sacrifice. Thus too in 83. 1-2 : " O lord of prayer,^ thy
purifier (the sieve) is extended. Prevailing thou enterest its limbs on all sides. Raw (soma), that has not been cooked (with milk) does not enter into it. Only the cooked (soma), going through, enters it. The sieve of the hot drink is extended in the place of the sky. Its gleaming threads extend on all sides.
This (soma's) swift (streams) preserve the man that purifies them, and wisely ascend to the back of the sky." In this, as in many hymns, the drink soma is clearly addressed ; yet expressions are used which, if detached, easily might be thought
to imply the moon (or the sun, as with Bergaigne) — a fact that should make one employ other expressions of the same sort with great circumspection. Or, let one compare, with the preparation by the ten fingers, 85. 7 : "Ten fingers rub clean (prepare) the steed in the vessels ; uprise the songs of the priests. The intoxicating drops, as they purify themselves, meet the song of praise and enter Indra." Exactly the same images as are found above may be noted in ix. 87, where not the moon, but the plant, is conspicuously the subject of the hymn : " Run into the pail, purified by men go unto booty. They lead thee like a swift horse with reins to the sacrificial straw, preparing (or rubbing)
thee. With good weapons shines the divine (shining) drop (indu), slaying evil-doers, guarding the assembly; the father
of the gods, the clever begetter, the support of the sky, the
holder of earth. . . . This one, the soma (plant) on being
pressed out, ran swiftly into the purifier like a stream let out,
sharpening his two sharp horns like a buffalo ; like a true hero hunting for cows ; he is come from the highest pressstone," etc. It is the noise oi soma dropping that is compared with 'roaring.' The strength given by (him) the drink, makes

SOM^. 119
him appear as the 'virile one,' of which force is the activity,
and the bull the type. Given, therefore, the image of the bull, the rest follows easily to elaborate the metaphor. If one add
that soma is luminous (yellow), and that all luminous divinities are 'horned bulls,' ^ then it will be unnecessary to see the crescent moon in soma. Moreover, if soma be the same with Brihaspati, as thinks Hillebrandt, why are there three horns in V. 43. 13 ? Again, that the expression 'sharpening his horns' does not refer necessarily to the moon may be concluded from
X. 86. 15, where it is stated expressly that the drini is a sharphorned steer : " Like a sharp-horned steer is thy brewed drink, O Indra," probably referring to the taste. The sun, Agni, and Indra are all, to the Vedic poet, 'sharp-horned steers,'^ and the soma plant, being luminous and strong (bull-like), gets
the same epithet. The identity is rather with Indra than with the moon, if one be content to give up brilliant theorizing, and simply follow
the poets : " The one that purifies himself yoked the sun's swift steed over man that he might go through the atmosphere, and these ten steeds of the sun he yoked to go, saying Indra is the drop (tndii)." ^ When had ever the moon the power to start the sun ? What part in the pantheon is played by the moon when it is called by its natural name (not by the priestly name, soma) ? Is mas or candramas (moon) a power of strength, a great god ? The words scarcely occur, except in late hymns, and the moon, by his own folk-name, is hardly praised except in mechanical
conjunction with the Sun. The floodg of which so7na is lord are explained in ix. 86. 24-25 : "The hawk (or eagle) brought thee from the sky, O drop (indu), . . . seven milk-streams
sing to the yellow one as he purifies himself with the wave in
the sieve of sheep's wool. The active strong ones have sent

forth the wise seer in the lap of the waters." If one wishes to clear his mind in respect of what the Hindu attributes to
the divine drink (expressly drink, and not moon), let him read ix. 104, where he will find that "the twice powerful god-rejoic
ing intoxicating drink " finds goods, finds a path for his friends, puts away every harmful spirit and every devouring spirit, averts
the false godless one and all oppression ; and read also ix.
21. 1-4 : "These j-c/«a-drops for Indra flow rejoicing, madden
ing, light- (or heaven-) finding, averting attackers, finding
desirable things for the presser, making -life for the singer. Like waves the drops flow into one vessel, playing as they
will. These soma-dao^s, let out like steeds (attached) to a
car, as they purify themselves, attain all desirable things."
According to ix. 97. 41^ and ib. 37. 4 (and other like passages, too lightly explained, p. 387, by Hillebrandt), it is sotna that
"produced the light in the sun" and "makes the sun rise," statements incompatible with the (lunar) Soma's functions, but quite in accordance with the magic power which the poets
attribute to the divine drink. Soma is ' king over treasure.'
Soma is brought by the eagle that all may " see light " (ix. 48.
3-4). He traverses the sky, and guards order — but not necessarily is he here the moon, for soma, the drink, as a
"galloping steed," "a brilliant steer," a "stream of pressed soma,'' " a dear sweet," " a helper of gods," is here poured forth ;
after him "flow great water-floods"; and he "purifies himself
in the sieve, he the supporter, holder of the sky"; he "shines with the sun," "roars," and "looks like Mitra"; being here both " the intoxicating draught," and at the same time " the giver of
kine, giver of men, giver of horses, giver of strength, the soul of sacrifice" (ix. 2).
Soma is even older than the Vedic Indra as slayer of Vritra and snakes. Several Indo-Iranian epithets survive (of soma
and haoma, respectively), and among those of Iran is the title ' Vritra-slayer,' appKed to haoma, the others being 'strong' and

'heaven-winning,' just as in the Veda.' All three of them are contained in one of the most lunar-like of the hymns to Soma, which, for this reason, and because it is one of the few to this
deity that seem to be not entirely mechanical, is given here
nearly in full, with the original shift of metre in the middle of the hymn (which may possibly indicate that two hymns have been united).

Of more popular songs, Hillebrandt cites as sung to Soma ( !)
viii. 69. 8-10
:
Sing loud to him, sing loud to him ; Priyamedhas, oh, sing to him, And sing to him the children, too
;
Extol him as a sure defence. . . . To Indra is the prayer up-raised.
The three daily soma-o\>\2X\ovi.s are made chiefly to Indra and Vayu; to Indra at mid-day; to the Ribhus, artisans of the gods, at evening ; and to Agni in the morning. Unmistakable references to Soma as the moon, as, for instance,
in X. 85. 3 : " No one eats of that soma which the priests know," seem rather to indicate that the identification of moon and Soma was something esoteric and new rather than the received belief of pre-Vedic times, as will Hillebrandt. This moonsoma is distinguished from the " soma-plsLnt which they crush."
The floods of soma are likened to, or, rather, identified with,
the rain-floods which the lightning frees, and, as it were, brings to earth with him. A whole series of myths depending on this natural phenomenon has been evolved, wherein the lightning

124 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
fire as an eagle brings down soma to man, that is, the heavenlydrink. Since Agni is threefold and the Gayatri metre is three
fold, they interchange, and in the legends it is again the metre
which brings the soma, or an archer, as is stated in one doubt
ful passage.' What stands out most clearly in j-^^za-laudations is that the
jowza-hymns are not only quite mechanical, but that they presuppose a very complete and elaborate ritual, with the employment of a number of priests, of whom the hotars (one of the various
sets of priests) alone number five in the early and seven in the late books ; with a complicated service ; with certain divinities honored at certain hours ; and other paraphernalia of sacerdotal ceremony ; while Indra, most honored with Soma, and Agni, most closely connected with the execution of sacrifice, not only receive the most hymns, but these hymns are, for the
most part, palpably made for ritualistic purposes. It is this
truth that the ritualists have seized upon and too sweepingly applied. For in every family book, besides this baksheesh verse, occur the older, purer hymns that have been retained after the worship for which they were composed had become changed into a trite making of phrases. Hillebrandt has failed to show that the Iranian haoma is
the moon, so that as a starting-point there still is plant and
drink-worship, not moon-worship. At what precise time, therefore, the soma was referred to the moon is not so important. Since drink-worship stands at one end of the series, and moonworship at the other, it is antecedently probable that here and there there may be a doubt as to which of the two was intended. Some of the examples cited by Hillebrandt may
indeed be referable to the latter end of the series rather than
to the former ; but that the author, despite the learning and

SOMA. . 12S
ingenuity of his work, has proved his point definitively, we are
far from believing. It is just like the later Hindu speculation to think out a subtle connection between moon and soma-plant because each was yellow, and swelled, and went through a sieve (cloud), etc. But there is a further connecting link in that
the divinity ascribed to the intoxicant led to a supposition that it was brought from the sky, the home of the gods ; above all, of the luminous gods, which the yellow soma resembled.
Such was the Hindu belief, and from this as a starting-point appears to have come the gradual identification of soma with the moon, now called Soma. For the moon, even under the name of Gandharva, is not the object of especial worship. The question so ably discussed by Hillebrandt is, however, one of considerable importance from the point of view of the religious development. If soma from the beginning was the moon, then there is only one more god of nature to add to the pantheon. But if, as we believe in the light of the Avesta
and Veda itself, sojna, like Aaoma, was originally the drinkplant (the root su, press, from which comes soma, implies the
plant), then two important facts follow. First, in the identifi
cation of yellow soma--pl3.nt with yellow moon in the latter stage of the Rig Veda (which coincides with the beginning of the
Brahmanic period) there is a striking illustration of the gradual
mystical elevation of religion at the hands of the priests, to whom it appeared indecent that mere drink should be exalted
thus ; and secondly, there is the significant fact that in the
Indie and Iranian cult there was a direct worship of deified
liquor, analogous to Dionysiac rites, a worship which is not unparalleled in other communities. Again, the surprising identity of worship in Avesta and Veda, and the fact that hymns to the earlier deities. Dawn, Parjanya, etc., are frequently
devoid of any relation to the soma-c\i\t, not only show that
Bergaigne's opinion that the whole Rig Veda is but a collection of hymns for soma-vforship as handed down in different



126 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
families must be modified ; but also that, as we have explained apropos of Varuna, the Iranian cult must have branched off from the Vedic cult (whether, as Haug thought, on account
of a religious schism or not) ; that the hymns to the less popu
lar deities (as we have defined the word) make the first period
of Vedic cult ; and that the special liquor-cult, common to Iran
and India, arose after the first period of Vedic worship, when, for example, Wind, Parjanya, and Varuna were at their height, and before the priests had exalted mystically Agni or Soma, and even Indra was as yet undeveloped.



CHAPTER Vr.
THE RIG VEDA (CONCLUDED). — YAMA AND OTHER GODS,
VEDIC PANTHEISM, ESCHATOLOGY.
In the last chapter we have traced the character of two great gods of earth, the altar-fire and the personified kind of
beer which was the Vedic poets' chief drink till the end of this
period. With the discovery of surd, humor ex hordeo (oryzaque ;
Weber, Vdjapeya, p. 19), and the difficulty of obtaining the
original j^^OT^-plant (for the plant used later for soma, the asdepias acida, or sarcostemma viminale, does not grow in the Punjab
region, and cannot have been the original soma), the status of soma became changed. While surd became the drink of the people, soma, despite the fact that it was not now so agreeable
a liquor, became reserved, from its old associations, as the priests' (gods') drink, a sacrosanct beverage, not for the vulgar, and not esteemed by the priest, except as it kept up the rite. It has been shown that these gods, earthly in habitation,
absorbed the powers of the older and physically higher divini
ties. The ideas that clustered about the latter were transferred
to the former. The altar-fire, Agni, is at once earth-fire, lightning, and sun. The drink soma is identified with the heavenly
drink that refreshes the earth, and from its color is taken at
last to be the terrestrial form of its aqueous prototype, the
moon, which is not only yellow, but even goes through cloudmeshes just as soma goes through the sieve, with all the other points of comparison that priestly ingenuity can devise.
Of different sort altogether from these gods is the ancient
Indo-Iranian figure that now claims attention. The older religion had at least one object of devotion very difficult to
reduce to terms of a nature-religion.



128 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
YAMA.
Exactly as the Hindu had a half-divine ancestor, Manu, who
by the later priests is regarded as of solar origin, while more probably he is only the abstract Adam (man), the progenitor of the race; so in Yama the Hindu saw the primitive "first of mortals." While, however, Mitra, Dyaus, and other older
nature-gods, pass into a state of negative or almost forgotten
activity, Yama, even in the later epic period, still remains a
potent sovereign — the king of the dead. In the Avesta Yima is the son of the ' wide-gleaming ' Vivangh
vant, the sun, and here it is the sun that first prepares the
soma (liaomd) for man. And so, too, in the Rig Veda it is Yama the son of Vivasvant (x. 58. i ; 60. 10) who first "extends the web" of {soma) sacrifice (vii. 33. 9, 12). The Vedic
poet, not influenced by later methods of interpretation, saw
in Yama neither sun nor moon, nor any other natural phenomenon, for thus he sings, differentiating Yama from them all : " I praise with a song Agni, Pushan, Sun and Moon, Yama in heaven, Trita, Wind, Dawn, the Ray of Light, the Twin Horsemen " (x. 64. 3); and again : " Deserving of laudation are Heaven and Earth, the four-limbed Agni, Yama,
Aditi," etc. (x. 92. 11). Yama is regarded as a god, although in the Rig Veda he is called only 'king' (x. 14. i, 11); but later he is expressly a god, and this is implied, as Ehni shows, even in the Rig Veda
:
'a god found Agni' and 'Yama found Agni' (x. 51. i ff.). His primitive nature was that of the 'first mortal that died,' in
the words of the Atharva Veda. It is true, indeed, that at a
later period even gods are spoken of as originally ' mortal,' ^
but this is a conception alien from the early notions of the Veda, where 'mortal' signifies no more than 'man.' Yama
1 Compare Taitt. S. vii. 4. 2. i. The gods win immortality by means of ' sacrifice
'
in this later priest-ridden period.



YAMA. 129
was the first mortal, and he lives in the sky, in the home that "holds heroes," i.e., his abode is where dead heroes congregate
(i. 35. 6; X. 64. 3).^ The fathers that died of old are cared for lay him as he sits drinking with the gods beneath a fair
tree (x. 135. 1-7). The fire that devours the corpse is invoked
to depart thither (x. 16. 9). This place is not very definitely
located, but since, according to one prevalent view, the saints guard the sun, and since Yama's abode in the sky is comparable with the sun in one or two passages, it is probable that the general idea was that the departed entered the Sun and there Yama received him (i. 105. 9, 'my home is there where are the sun's rays'; x. 154. 4-5, 'the dead shall go, O Yama, to the fathers, the seers that guard the sun '). ' Yama's abode ' is the same with 'sky' (x. 123. 6); and when it is said, 'may
the fathers hold up the pillar (in the grave), and may Yama
build a seat for thee there' (x. 18. 13), this refers, not to the
grave, but to heaven. And it is said that ' Yama's seat is wliat
is called the gods' home' (x. 135. 7).^ But Yama does not remain in the sky. He comes, as do other Powers, to the
' sacrifice, and is invited to seat himself ' with Angirasas and the
•fathers' at the feast, where he rejoices with them (x. 14. 3-4; 15. 8). And either because Agni devours corpses for Yama, or because of Agni's part in the sacrifice which Yama so joyfully attends, therefore Agni is especially mentioned as Yama's
friend (x. 21. 5), or even his priest {ib. 52. 3). Yama stands in his relation to the dead so near to death that 'to go on Yama's path ' is to go on the path of death ; and battle is called ' Yama's strife.' It is even possible that in one passage Yama
is directly identified with death (x. 165. 4, 'to Yama be rever
ence, to death'; i. 38. 5; tb. ii5. 2).^ There is always a close
1 Ludwig (iv. p. 134) wrongly understands a hell here. 2
' Yama's seat ' Is here what it is in the epic, not a chapel (Pischel), but a home. 3 This may mean 'to Yama (and) to death.' In the Atharva Veda, v. 24. 13-14, it is said that Death is the lord of men ; Yama, of the Manes.



130 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
connection between Varuna and Yama, and perhaps it is owing
to this that parallel to ' Varuna's fetters' is found also ' Yania's
fetter,' i.e., death (x. 97. 16).
As Yama was the first to die, so was he the first to teach
man the road to immortality, which lies through sacrifice, whereby man attains to heaven and to immortality. Hence the poet says, ' we revere the immortality born of Yama
'
(i. 83. 5). This, too, is the meaning of the mystic verse which speaks of the sun as the heavenly courser 'given by Yama,' for, in giving the way to immortality, Yama gives also the sunabode to them that become immortal. In the same hymn the
sun is identified with Yama as he is with Trita (i. 163. 3).
This particular identification is due, however, rather to the developed pantheistic idea which obtains in the later hymns. A parallel is found in the next hymn: "They speak of Indra,
Mitra, Varuna, Agni . . . that which is one, the priests speak of in many ways, and call him Agni, Yama, Fire " (or Wind,
i. 164. 46). Despite the fact that one Vedic poet speaks of Yama's name as ' easy to understand ' (x. 12. 6), no little ingenuity has been spent on it, as well as on the primitive conception underlying his personality. Etymologically, his name means Twin, and
this is probably the real meaning, for his twin sister YamI is also a Vedic personage. The later age, regarding Yama as a restrainer and punisher of the wicked, derived the name from yam, the restrainer or punisher, but such an idea is quite out of place in the province of Vedic thought. The Iranian Yima also has a sister of like name, although she does not appear
till late in the literature.
That Yama's father is the sun, Vivasvant (Savitar, 'the arti
ficer,' Tvasht^r, x. 10. 4-5),^ is clearly enough stated in the
1 It is here said, also, that the ' Gandharva in the waters and the water-woman
'
are the ties of consanguinity between Yama and YamI, which means, apparently, that their parents were Moon and Water; a late idea, as in viii. 48. 13 (unique).



VAMA. 131
Rik ; and that he was the first mortal, in the Atharvan. Men come from Yama, and Yama comes from the sun as 'creator,' just as men elsewhere come from Adam and Adam comes from the Creator. But instead of an Hebraic Adam and Eve there are in India a Yama and Yami, brother and sister (wife), who, in the one hymn in which the latter is introduced (/oc. df.), indulge in a moral conversation on the propriety of wedlock between brother and sister. This hymn is evidently a protest against a union that was unobjectionable to an older generation. In the Yajur Veda Yami is wife and sister both. But sometimes, in the varying fancies of the Vedic poets, the artificer Tvashtar is differentiated from Vivasvant, the sun ; as he is in another passage, where Tvashtar gives to Vivasvant his daughter, and she is the mother of Yama.^ That men are the children of Yama is seen in x. 13. 4, where it is said, ' Yama averted death for the gods ; he did not avert death for (his) posterity.' In the Brahmanic tradition men
derive from the sun (Taitt. S. vi. 5. 6. 2).^ So, in the Iranian belief, Yima is looked upon, according to some scholars, as the first man. The funeral hymn to Yama is as follows
:
Him wlio once went over thie great mountains ^ and spied out a path for
many, tlie son of Vivasvant, wlio collects men, King Yama, revere ye with oblations. Yama the first found us a way . . . There where our old fathers
are departed. . . . Yama is magnified with the Angirasas. ... Sit here, O
Yama, with the Angirasas and with the fathers. . . . Rejoice, O king, in this oblation. Come, O Yama, with the venerable Angirasas. I call thy father,
Vivasvant, sit down at this sacrifice.
And then, turning to the departed soul
:
Go forth, go forth on the old paths where are gone our old fathers;
thou Shalt see both joyous kings, Yama and God Varuna. Unite with the
1 The passage, x. 17. 1-2, is perhaps meant as a riddle, as Bloomfield suggests
(JAOS. XV. p. 17^). At any rate, it is still a dubious passage. Compare Hille

132 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
fathers, with Yama, with the satisfaction of desires, in highest heaven. . . . Yama will give a resting place to this spirit. Run past, on a good path, the two dogs of Sarama, the four-eyed, spotted ones ; go unto the fathers who rejoice with Yama.
Several things are here noteworthy. In the first place, the Atharva Veda reads, " who first of mortals died," -^ and this is the meaning of the Rig Veda version, although, as was said
above, the mere fact that Varuna is called a god and Yama a king proves nothing.^ But it is clearly implied here that he who crossed the mountains and ' collected men,' as does Yima in the Iranian legend, is an ancient king,' as it is also implied that he led the way to heaven. The dogs of Yama are described in such a way as to remind one of the dogs that guard the path the dead have to pass in the Iranian legend, and of Kerberus, with whose very name the adjective 'spotted' has been compared.'- The dogs are elsewhere described as white and brown and as barking (vii. 55. 2), and in further verses of the hymn just quoted (x. 14) they are • called "thy guardian dogs, O Yama, the four-eyed ones who guard the path, who look on men . . . broad-nosed, dark messengers of Yama, who run among the people." These dogs are due to the same fantasy that creates a Kerberus, the Iranian dogs,'' or other guardians of the road that leads to heaven. The description is too minute to make it probable that the Vedic poet understood them to be 'sun and moon,' as the later Brahmanical ingenuity explains them, and as they have been explained by modern scholarship. It is not possible that the poet, had he had in mind any connection

YAMA. 133
between the dogs and the sun and moon (or 'night and day'), ^would have described them as ' barking ' or as ' broad-nosed and darlc'; and all interpretation of Yama's dogs must rest on the interpretation of Yama himself.^
Yama is oot mentioned elsewhere "^ in the Rig Veda, except in the statement that 'metres rest on Yama,' and in the closing verses of the burial hymn : " For Yama press the soma, for Yama pour oblation ; the sacrifice goes to Yama ; he shall extend for us a long life among the gods," where the pun on Yama {yamad a ), in the sense of 'stretch out,' shows that as yet no thought of ' restrainer ' was in the poet's mind, although the sense of ' twin ' is lost from the name. In recent years Hillebrandt argues that because the Manes are connected with Soma (as the moon), and because Yama was the first to die, therefore Yama wa's the moon. Ehni, on the other hand, together with Bergaigne and some other
scholars, takes Yama to be the sun. Miiller calls him the 'setting-sun.'^ The argument from the Manes applies better to the sun than to the moon, but it is not conclusive. "The Hindus in the Vedic age, as later, thought of the Manes living in stars, moon, sun, and air ; and, if they were not good Manes but dead sinners, in the outer edge of the universe or under
ground. In short, they are located in every conceivable place.'' The Yama, 'who collects people,' has been rightly compared with the Yima, who 'made a gathering of the people,' but it
is doubtful whether one should see in this an Aryan trait ; for "AtSj^s 'AyTyo-iAaos is not early and popular, but late (Aeschylean),
1 Scherman proposes an easy solution, namely to cut the description in two, and make only part of it refer to the dogs ! (loc. cit. p. 130). 2 The dogs may be meant in i. 29. 3, but compare ii. 31. 5. Doubtful is i. 66. 8, according to Bergaigne, applied to Yama as fire. 3 India, p. 224. * Barth, p. 23, cites i. 125. 6 ; a. 107. 2 ; 82. 2, to prove that stars are souls of dead men. These passages do not prove the point, but it may be inferred from x. 68. 11. Later on it is a received belief. A moon-heaven is found only in viii. 48.



134 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
and the expression may easily have arisen independently in the mind of the Greek' poet. From a comparative point of view, in the reconstruction of Yama there is no conclusive evidence which will permit one to identify his original character either
with sun or moon. Much rather he appears to be as he is in
the Rig Veda, a primitive king, not Iiistorically so, but poeti
cally, the first man, fathered of the sun, to whom he returns,
and in whose abode he collects his offspring after their inevita
ble death on earth. In fact, in Yama there is the ideal side
of ancestor-worship. He is a poetic image, the first of all
fathers, and hence their type and king. Yama's name is unknown outside of the Indo-Iranian circle, and though Ehni seeks to find traces of him in Greece . and elsewhere,^ this
scholar's identifications fail, because he fails to note that
similar ideas in myths* are no proof of their common origin. It has been suggested that in the paradise of Yama over the mountains there is a companion-piece to the hyperboreans, whose felicity is described by Pindar. The nations that came
from the north still kept in legend a recollection of the land from whence they came. This suggestion cannot, of course, be proved, but it is the most probable explanation yet given of the first paradise to which the dead revert. In the late Vedic period, when the souls of the dead were not supposed to linger on earth with such pleasure as in the sky, Yama's abode is raised to heaven. Later still, when to the Hindu the south was the land of death, Yama's hall of judgment is again
brought down to earth and transferred to the ' southern district.'
The careful investigation of Scherman^ leads essentially to the same conception of Yama as that we have advocated. Scherman believes that Yama was first a human figure, and
was then elevated to, if not identified with, the sun. Scher
man's only error is in disputing the generally-received opinion,
1 Especially with Ymir in Scandinavian mythology. 2 VisionsUtteraiur, 1892.



y^.A/A. 135
one that is on the whole correct, that Yama in the early period is a kindly sovereign, and in later times becomes the dread
king of horrible hells. Despite some testimony to the con
trary, part of which is late interpolation in the epic, this is
the antithesis which exists in the works of the respective
periods. The most important gods of the era of the Rig Veda we now have reviewed. But before passing on to the next period it should be noticed that no small number of beings remains
who are of the air, devilish, or of the earth, earthy. Like the
demons that injure man by restraining the tain in the clouds, so there are Mufs, ghosts, spooks, and other lower powers, some malevolent, some good-natured, who inhabit earth ; whence demonology. There is, furthermore, a certain chrematheism, as we have elsewhere ^ ventured to call it, which pervades the Rig Veda, the worship of more or less personified things, differing from pantheism in this,^ that whereas pantheism assumes
-a like divinity in all things, this kind of theism assumes that
everything (or anything) has a separate divinity, usually that
which is useful to the worshipper, as, the plough, the furrow, etc. . In later hymns these objects are generally of sacrificial pature, and the stones with which soma is pressed are divine like the plant. Yet often there is no sacrificial observance to cause this veneration. Hymns are addressed to_weapons, to the jiaxzS3-r, as to divine beings. Sorcery and incantation is not looked upon favorably, but nevertheless it is found. Another class of divinities includes abstractions, generally
female, such as Infinity, Piety, Abundance, with the barely-mentioned Gungu, Raka, etc. (which may be moon-phases). The ,
1 Henotheism in ilie Rig Veda, p. 8i. 2 This religious phase is often confounded loosely with pantheism, but the distinction should be observed. Parkman speaks of (American) Indian ' pantheism '
;
and Barth speaks of ritualistic ' pantheism,' meaning thereby the deification of differ
ent objects used in sacrifice (p. 37, note). But chrematheism is as distinct from
pantheism as it is from fetishism.



136 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
most important of these abstractions ^ is ' the lord of strength,' a
priestly interpretation of Indra, interpreted as religious strength
or prayer, to whom are accredited all of Indra's special acts.
Hillebrandt interprets this god, Brahmanaspati or Brihaspati, as
the moon ; Miiller, somewhat doubtfully, as fire ; while Roth
will not allow that Brihaspati has anything to do with natural phenomena, but considers him to have been from the beginning ' lord of prayer.' With this view we partly concur, but we would make the important modification that the god was lord of prayer
only as priestly abstraction of Indra in his higher development. It is from this god is come probably t}ie head of the later trinity, Brahma, through personified hrahma, power, prayer, with .its philosophical development into the Absolute. Noteworthy is the fact that some of the Vedic Aryans, despite his high pre
tensions, do not quite like Brihaspati, and look on him as a suspicious novelty. If one study Brihaspati in the hymns, it will be difficult not to see in him simply a sacerdotal Indra. He breaks the demon's power ; crushes the foes of man ; consumes the demons with a sharp bolt ; disperses darkness
;
drives forth the ' cows ' ; gives offspring and riches ; helps in battle ; discovers Dawn and Agni ; has a band (like Maruts) singing about him ; he is red and golden, and is identified with
fire. Although 'father of gods,' he is begotten of Tvashtar,
the artificer.^
Weber has suggested (Vajapeya Sacrifice, p. 15), that Brihaspati takes Indra's place, and this seems to be the true solution,
Indra as interpreted mystically by priests. In RV. i. 190, Bri
haspati is looked upon by 'sinners' as a new god of little value. Other minor deities can be mentioned only briefly, chiefly that the extent of the pantheon may be seen. For the history of
1 Some seem to be old ; thus Aramati, piety, has an Iranian representative, Armaiti. As masculine abstractions are to be added Anger, Death, etc. 2 Compare iv. 50; ii. 23 and 24; v. 43. 12; x. 68. 9; ii. 26. 3; 23. 17; x. 97. 15. For interpretation compare Hillebrandt, Ved.

religion tliey are of only collective importance. The All-gods
play an important part in the sacrifice, a group of 'all the gods,' a priestly manufacture to the end that no god may be omitted in laudations that would embrace all the gods. The later priests attempt to identify these gods with the clans, ' the
All-gods are the clans ' {(^at. Br. v. s- i- lo), on the basis of a theological pun, the clans, vifas, being equated with the word
for all, vicve. Some modern scholars follow these later priests, but without reason. Had these been special clan-gods, they would have had special names, and would not have appeared
in a group alone.
The later epic has a good deal to say about some lovely nymphs called the Apsarasas, of whom it mentions six as chief (Urvagi, Menaka, etc.).^ They fall somewhat in the epic from their Vedic estate, but they are never more than secondary
figures, love-goddesses, beloved of the Gandharvas who later are the singing guardians of the moon, and, like the lunar stations, twenty-seven in number. The Rik knows at first but one Gandharva (an inferior genius, mentioned in but one family-book), who guards Soma's path, and, when Soma becomes the moon, is identified with him, ix. 86. 36. As in the
Avesta, Gandharva is (the moon as) an evil spirit also; but always as a second-rate power, to whom are ascribed magic (and madness, later). He has virtually no cult except in soma-,
hymns, and shows clearly the first Aryan conception of the moon as a demoniac power, potent over women, and associated
with waters. Mountains, and especially rivers, are holy, and of course
are deified. Primitive belief generally deifies rivers. But in the great river-hymn in the Rig Veda there is probably as much pure poetry as prayer. The Vedic poet half believed in the rivers' divinity, and sings how they 'rush forth like armies,'
but it will not do to inquire too strictly in regard to his belief.

138 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
He was a poet, and did not expect to be catechized. Of female divinities there are several of which the nature is doubtful. As Dawn or Storm have been interpreted Sarama and Saranyu, both meaning 'runner.' The former is Indra's dog, and her litter is the dogs of Yama. One little poem, rather
than hymn, celebrates the ' wood-goddess ' in pretty verses of
playful and descriptive character.
Long before there was any formal recognition of the dogma that all gods are one, various gods had been identified by the
Vedic poets. Especially, as most naturally, was this the case when diverse gods having different names were similar in any way, such as Indra and Agni, whose glory is iire ; or Varuna and Mitra, whose seat is the sky. From this casual union of like" pairs comes the peculiar custom of invoking two gods as one. But even in the case of gods not so radically connected, if their functions were mutually approximate, each in turn became credited with his neighbor's acts. If the traits were
similar which characterized each, if the circles of activity over
lapped at all, then those divinities that originally were tangent
to each other gradually became concentric, and eventually were united. And so the lines between the gods were wiped out, as it were, by their conceptions crowding upon one another. There was another factor, however, in the development of this unconscious, or, at least, unacknowledged, pantheism.
Aided by the likeness or identity of attributes in Indra, Savitar, Agni, Mitra, and other gods, many^ of which were virtually the
same under a different designation, the priests, ever prone to extravagance of word, soon began to attribute, regardless of strict propriety, every power to every god. With the exception
of some of the older divinities, whose forms, as they are less complex, retain throughout the simplicity of their primitive character, few gods escaped this adoration, which tended to make them all universally supreme, each being endowed with all the attributes of godhead. One might think that no better



YAMA. 139
fate could happen to a god than thus to be magnified. But when each god in the pantheon was equally glorified, the effect on the whole was disastrous. In fact, it was the death of the
gods whom it was the intention of the seers to" exalt." And
the reason is plain. From this universal praise it resulted that the^ individuality of each god became less distinct ; every
god was become, so to speak, any god, so far as his peculiar
attributes made him a god at all, so that out of the very praise
that was given to him and his confreres alike there arose the idea of the abstract godhead, the god who was all the gods, t he one god. As a pure abstraction one finds thus Aditi, as equivalent to 'all the gods," and then the more personal idea of the god that is father of all, which soon becomes
the purely personal All-god. It is at this stage where begins conscious premeditated pantheism, which in its first beginTnngs is more like monofheism, although in India there is no monotheism which does not include devout polytheism, as will be seen in the review of the formal philosophical systems of
religion. It is thus that we have attempted elsewhere ^ to explain that phase of Hindu religion which Miiller calls henotheism.
'
Miiller, indeed, would make of henotheism a new religion, but this, the worshipping of each divinity in turn as if it were the greatest and even the only god recognized, is rather the result
of the general tendency to exaltation, united with pantheistic
beginnings. Granting that pure polytheism is found in a few hymns, one may yet say that this polytheism, with an accom
paniment of half-acknowledged chrematheism, passed soon into
the belief that several divinities were ultimately and essentially but one, which may be described as homoiotheism ; and that the poets of the Rig Veda were unquestionably esoterically
li. 89. 10; "Aditi is all the gods and men; Aditi is whatever has been born;
Aditi is whatever will be born." 2 Henotheism in the Rig Veda (Drisler Memorial).



140 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
unitarians to a much greater extent and in an earlier period tlian has generally been acknowledged. Most of the hymns of the Rig Veda were composed under the influence of that unification of deities and tendency to a quasi-monotheism, which eventually results both in philosophical pantheism, and
in the recognition at the same time of a personal first cause. To express the difference between Hellenic polytheism and
the polytheism of the Rig Veda the latter should be called, if by any new term, rather by a name like pantheistic polytheism, than by the somewhat misleading word henotheism. What is novel in it is that it represents the fading of pure polytheisni
and the engrafting, upon a polytheistic stock, of a speculative homoiousian tendency soon to bud out as philosophic pantheism. The admission that other gods exist does not nullify the
attitude of tentative monotheism. " Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods ? " asks Moses, and his father-in-law, when converted to the new belief, says : " Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods." -^ But this is not the quasimonotheism of the Hindu, to whom the other gods were real and potent factors, individually distinct from the one supreme god, who represents the All-god, but is at once abstract and concrete.
Pantheism in the Rig Veda comes out clearly only in one or two passages : " The priests represent in many ways the (sun) bird that is one"; and (cited above) "They speak of him as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, . . . that which is but one they
call variously." So, too, in the Atharvan it is said that Varuna (here a pantheistic god) is "in the little drop of water," -as
in the Rik the spark of material fire is identified with the sun.
The new belief is voiced chiefly in that portion of the Rig Veda which appears to be latest and most Brahmanic in tone.

YAMA. 141
Here a supreme god is described under the name of " Lord of Beings," tlie "All-maker," "The Golden Germ," the "God
over gods, the spirit of their being" (x. 121). The last, a famous hymn, Miiller entitles "To the Unknown God." It
may have been intended, as has been suggested, for a theo
logical puzzle,! but its language evinces that in whatever form
it is couched — eacl^ verse ends with the refrain, 'To what god
shall we offer sacrifice ? ' till the last verse answers the ques
tion, saying, 'the Lord of beings' — it is meant to raise the question of a supreme deity and leave it unanswered in terms of a nature-religion, though the germ is at bottom fire : " In the beginning arose the Golden Germ; as soon as born he
became the Lord of All. He established earth and heaven
to what god shall we offer sacrifice ? He who gives breath, strength, whose command the shining gods obey ; whose shadow is life and death. . . . When the great waters went everywhere Iiolding the_ germ and generating light, then arose from them
the one spirit (breath) of the gods. . . . May he not hurt us, he the begetter of earth, the holy one who begot heaven . . . Lord of beings, thou alone embracest all things . . ."
In this closing period of the Rig Veda — a period which in many ways, the sudden completeness of caste, the recognition of several Vedas, etc., is much farther removed from the beginning of the work than it is from the period of Brahmanic specu
lation — philosophy is hard at work upon the problems of the origin of gods and of being. As in the last hymn, water is the
origin of all things ; out of this springs fire, and the wind which is the breath of god. So in the great hymn of creation : " There was then neither not-being nor being ; there was no atmosphere, no sky. What hid (it) ? Where and in the protection of what ^ Was it water, deep darkness ? There was no death nor immortality. There was no difference between night and day. That One breathed . . . nothing other than this or above it existed.
1 Bloomfield, JAOS. xv. 184.



142 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Darkness was concealed in darkness in the beginning. Undif
ferentiated water was all this (universe)." Creation is then
declared to have arisen by virtue of desire, which, in the beginning was the origin of mind;^ and "the gods," it is said
further, "were created after this." Whether entity springs
from non-entity or vice versa is discussed in another hymn of the same book.'' The most celebrated of the pantheistic hymns is that in which the .universe is regarded as portions of the deity conceived as the primal Person: "Purusha (the Male
Person) is this all, what has been and will be . . . all created
things are a fourth of him ; that which is immortal in the sky is three-fourths of him." The hymn is too well known to be quoted entire. All the castes, all gods, all animals, and the
three (or four) Vedas are parts of him.^ Such is the mental height to which the seers have raised themselves before the end of the ^ig Veda. The figure of
the Father-god, Prajapati, ' lord of beings,' begins here ; at
first an epithet of Savitar, and finally the type of Jhe head of a pantheon, such as one finds him to be in the Brahmanasl Tti one hymn only (x. 121) is Prajapati found as the personal Father-god and All-god. At a time when philosophy created the one Universal Male Person, the popular religion, keeping pace, as far as it could, with philosophy, invented the more
anthropomorphized, more human. Father-god — whose name is ultimately interpreted as an interrogation, God Who ? This trait lasts from now On through all speculation. The philosopher conceived of a first source. The vulgar made it a personal god. One of the most remarkable hymns of this epoch is that on Vac, Speech, or The Word. Weber has sought in this the prototype of the Logos doctrine (below). The Word, Vac (feminine) is introduced as speaking (x. 125):
1 " Desire, the primal seed of mind," x. 129. 4. 2 X. 72 (contains also the origin of the gods from Aditi). 8 X. go. Here chanddmsi^ carmina, is probably the Atharvan.



MANES. 143
I wander with the Rudras, with the Vasus,i with the Adityas, and with all the gods ; I support Mitra, Varuna, Indra-Agni, and the twin A9vins. . . . I give wealth to him that gives sacrifice, to him that presses the sotna. I am the queen, the best of those worthy of sacrifice. . . . The gods have put me in many places. ... I am that through which one eats, breathes, sees, and hears. . Him that I love I make strong, to be a priest, a seer, a wise man. 'Tis I bend Rudra's bow to hit the unbeliever; I prepare war for the people ; I am entered into heaven and earth. I beget the father of this (all) on the height ; my place is in the waters, the sea ; thence I extend myself among all creatures and touch heaven with my crown. Even I blow like the wind, encompassing all creatures. Above heaven and above earth, so great am I grown in majesty.
This is almost Vedantic pantheism with the Vishnuite doctrine of ' special grace ' included.
The moral tone of this period — if period it may be called may best be examined after one has studied the idea which the Vedic Hindu has formed of the life hereafter. The happiness of heaven will be typical of what he regards as best here.
Bliss beyond the grave depends in turn upon the existence of
the spirit after death, and, that the reader may understand this, we must say a few words in regard to the Manes, or fathers dead. " Father Manu," as he is called,^ was the first ' Man.' Subsequently he is the secondary parent as a kind of Noah
;
but Yama, in later tradition his brother, has taken his place
as norm of the departed fathers, Pitaras. These Fathers (Manes), although of different sort than the gods, are yet divine and have many godly powers, granting prayers and lending aid, as may be seen from this invocation : "O Fathers, may "the sky-people grant us life; may we follow
the course of the living" (x. 57. 5). One whole hymn is
addressed to these quasi-divinities (x. 15):
1 Rudras, Vasus, and Adityas, the three famous groups of gods. The Vasus are in Indra's train, the ' shining,' or, perhaps, ' good ' gods.
2 ii. ;3. 13; X. 100. 5, etc. It the idea of manus = bonus be rejected, the Latin manes may be referred to mSnavas, the children of Manu.



144 THE RELIGIONS OF IjVDIA.
Arise may the lowest, the highest, the middlemost Fathers, those worthy of the soma, who without harm have entered into the spirit (-world) ; may these Fathers, knowing the seasons, aid us at our call. This reverence be to-day to the Fathers, who of old and afterwards departed ; those who have settled in an earthly sphere,^ or among peoples living in fair places (the gods?). I have found the gracious Fathers, the descendant(s) and the wide-step ^ of Vishnu ; those who, sitting on the sacrificial straw, willingly partake of the pressed drink, these are most apt to come hither. . . . Come hither with blessings, O Fathers; may they come hither, hear us, address and bless us. . . . May ye not injure us for whatever impiety we have as men committed. . . . With those who are our former Fathers, those worthy of soma, who are come to the soma drink, the best (fathers), may Yama rejoicing, willingly with them that are willing, eat the oblations as much as is agreeable (to them). Come running, O Agni, with these (fathers), who thirsted among the gods and hastened hither, finding oblations and praised with songs. These gracious ones, the real poets, the P'athers that seat themselves at the sacrificial heat ; who are real eaters of oblation ; drinkers of oblation ; and are set together on one chariot with Indra and the gods. Come, O Agni, with these, a thousand, honored like gods, the ancient, the original Fathers who seat themselves at the sacrificial heat. . . . Thou, Agni, didst give the oblations to the Fathers, that eat according to their custom
;
do thou (too) eat, O god, the oblation offered (to thee). Thou knowest,
O thou knower (or finder) of beings, how many are the Fathers — those who are here, and who are not here, of whom we know, and of whom we know not. According to custom eat thou the well-made sacrifice. With those who, burned in fire or not burned, (now) enjoy themselves according to custom in the middle of the sky, do thou, being the lord, form (for us) a spirit life, a body according to (our) wishes.^
Often the Fathers are invoked in similar language in the hymn to the " All-gods " mentioned above, and occasionally no distinction is to be noticed between the powers and attributes of the Fathers and those of the gods. The Fathers, hke the luminous gods, "give light" (x. 107. i). Exactly like the
gods, they are called upon to aid the living, and even ' not to
1 Or : " in an earthly place, in the atmosphere, or," etc. 2 That is where the Fathers live. This is the only place where the Fathers are said to be nApdt (descendants) of Vishnu, and here the sense may be " I have discovered Ndpat (fire?) "' But in i. 154. 5 Vishnu's worshippers rejoice in his home. 8 Or ; " form as thou wilt this body (of a corpse) to spirit -life."

harm' (iii. 55. 2 ;. x. 15. 6). According to one verse, the Fathers have not attained the greatness of the gods, who impart strength only to the gods.^
The Fathers are kept distinct from the gods. When the laudations bestowed upon the former are of unequivocal character there is no confusion between the two.''
The good dead, to get to the paradise awaiting them, pass over water (X. 63. 10), and a bridge (ix. 41. 2). Here, by the gift of the gods, not by inherent capacity, they obtain immor
tality. He that believes on Agni, sings : " Thou puttest the mortal in highest immortality, O Agni"; and, accordingly, there is no suggestion that heavenly joys may cease ; nor is there in this age any notion of a GiJtterddmmerung. Immortality is described as " continuing life in the highest sky,'' another proof that when formulated the doctrine was that the soul of
the dead lives in heaven or in the sun.^ Other cases of immortality granted by different gods are recorded by Muir and Zimmer. Yet in one passage the words, "two paths I have heard of the Fathers (exist), of the gods and of mortals," may mean that the Fathers go the way of mortals or that of gods, rather than, as is the usual interpretation, that mortals have two paths, one of the Fathers and one
of the gods,^ for the dead may live on earth or in the air as well as in heaven. When a good man dies his breath, it is
said, goes to the wind, his eye to the sun, etc.^ — each part to
its appropriate prototype. — while the " unborn part " is carried

146 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
" to the world of the righteous," after having been burned and heated by the funeral fire. All these parts are restored to the soul, however, and Agni and Soma return to it what has been injured. With this Muir compares a passage in the Atharva
Veda where it is said that the Manes in heaven rejoice with all
their limbs.-' We dissent, therefore, wholly from Barth, who
declares that the dead are conceived of as " resting forever in the tomb, the narrow house of clay." The only passage cited
to prove this is x. i8. 10-13, where are the words (addressed to the dead man at the burial) : " Go now to mother earth . . . she
shall guard thee from destruction's lap. . . . Open wide, O earth,
be easy of access ; as a mother her son cover this man, O earth," etc. Ending with the verse quoted above : " May the Fathers hold the pillar and Yama there build thee a seat." ^ The following is also found in the Rig Veda bearing on this point : the prayer that one may meet his parents after death ; the statement that a generous man goes to the gods ; and a suggestion of the later belief that one wins immortality by means of
a son.^
The joys of paradise are those of earth ; and heaven is thus
described, albeit in a late hymn :^ "Where is light inexhaust
ible ; in the world where is placed the shining sky ; set me
in this immortal, unending world, O thou that purifiest thyself (Soma); where is king (Yama), the son of Vivasvant, and the
paradise of the sky ; * where are the flowing waters ; . there make me immortal. Where one can go as he will ; in the third heaven, the third vault of the sky; where are worlds full of light, there make me immortal ; where are wishes and desires
1 AV. »yiii. 4. 64 ; Muir, loc. cit. p. 298.

and the red (sun)'s highest place ; where one can follow his own habits^ and have satisfaction ; there make me immortal;
where exist delight, joy, rejoicing, and joyance ; where wishes are obtained, there make me immortal.'"' Here, as above, the saints join the Fathers, 'who guard the sun.'
There is a ' bottomless darkness ' occasionally referred to as a place where evil' spirits are to be sent by the gods ; and a
' deep place ' is mentioned as the portion of ' evil, false, un
truthful men'; while Soma casts into 'a hole' (abyss) those
that are irreligious.*
As darkness is hell to the Hindu, and as in all later time the demons are spirits of darkness, it is rather forced not to
see in these allusions a misty hell, without torture indeed, but
a place for the bad either 'far away,' as it is sometimes said
{pardvdti), or 'deep down,' 'under three earths,' exactly as the Greek has a hell below and one on the edge of the earth. Ordinarily, however, the gods are requested simply to annihilate
offenders. It is plain, as Zimmer says, from the office of Yama's dogs, that they kept out of paradise unworthy souls ; so that the annihilation cannot have been imagined to be purely corporeal.
But heaven is not oftenjiescribed, and hell never, in this period. Yet, when the paradise^desired is described, it is a place where
earthly joys are prolonged and intensified. Zimmer argues tliaTaTace which believes in good for the good hereafter must logically" believe in punishment for the wicked, and Scherman, strangely enough, agrees with this pedantic opinion.'' If either of these scholars had looked away from India to the western Indians he would have seen that, whereas almost all American

i Loc. cit. p. 123.



148 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Indians believe in a happy hereafter for good, warriors, only a very few tribes have any belief in punishment for the bad. At most a Niflheim awaits the coward. Weber thinks the Aryans already believed in a personal immortality, and we
agree with him. Whitney's belief that hell was not known
before the Upanishad period (in his translations of the Katha
Upanishad) is correct only if by hell torture is meant, and if the Atharvan is later than this Upanishad, which is improbable. The good dead in the Rig Veda return with Yama to the sacrifice to enjoy the' soma and viands prepared for them by their descendants. Hence the whole belief in the necessity
of a son in order to the obtaining of a joyful hereafter. What the rite of burial was to the Greek, a son was to the Hindu, a means of bliss in heaven. Roth apparently thinks that the Rig Veda's heaven is one that can best be described in Dr. Watt's hymn : There is a land of pure delight Where saints immortal reign, Eternal day excludes the night, And pleasures banish pain ;
and that especial stress should be laid on the word ' pure.' But there is very little teaching of personal purity in the Veda, and the poet who hopes for a heaven where he is to find ' longing women,' 'desire and its fulfillment' has in mind, in all proba
bility, purely impure delights. It is not to be assumed that the
earlier morality surpassed that of the later day, when, even in
the epic, the hero's really desired heaven is one of drunkenness and women ad libitum. Of the ' good man ' in the Rig Veda are demanded piety toward gods and manes an d liberality to priests ; truthfulness and courage ; and in the end of the work there is a suggestion of ascetic 'goodness' by means of
tapas, austerity.^ Grassman cites one hymn as dedicated to
1 X, 154. 2 ; 107. 2. Compare the mad ascetic, mi'tni^ viii. 17. 14.



INCANTA TIOJVS. 149
' Mercy.' It is really (not a hymn and) not on mercy, but a poem praising generosity. This generosity, however (and in
general this is true of the whole people), is not general gene
rosity, but liberality to the priests.^ The blessings asked for
are wealth (cattle, horses, gold, etc.), virile power, male children
('heroic offspring') and immortality, with its accompanying
joys. Once there is a tirade against the friend that is false to his friend (truth in act as well as in word) ;^ once only, a poem on concord, which seems to partake of the nature of an incantation. Incantations are rare in the Rig Veda, and appear to be
looked upon as objectionable. So in vii. 104 the charge of a ' magician ' is furiously repudiated ; yet do an incantation
against a rival wife, a mocking hymn of exultation after subduing rivals, and a few other hymns of like sort show that magical
practices were well known.
^
The sacrifice occupies a high place in the religion of the
Rig Veda, but it is not all-important, as it is later. Nevertheless, the same presumptuous assumption that the gods depend on earthly sacrifice is often made ; the result of which, even
before the collection was complete (iv. 50), was to teach that gods and men depended on the will of the wise men who knew how properly to conduct a sacrifice, the key-note of religious
pride in the Brahmanic period. Iiidra depends on the sacrificial soma to accomplish his great
works. The gods first got power through the sacrificial fire and soma^ That images of the gods were supposed to be

The sacrifice of animals, cattle, horses, goats, is customary ; that of man, legendary ; but it is implied in x. 18. 8 (Hillebrandt, ZDMG. xl. p. 708), and is ritualized in the next period (below).

powerful may be inferred from the late verses, "who buys
this Indra," etc. (above), but allusions to idolatry are else
where extremely doubtful.^
1 Phallic worship may be alluded to in that of the ' tail-gods,' as Garbe thinks, but it is deprecated. One verse, however, which seems to have crept in by mistake, is apparently due to phallic influence (viii. i. 34), though such a cult was not openly acknowledged till Civa-worship began, and is no part of Brahmanism.



CHAPTER VII.
THE RELIGION OF THE ATHARVA VEDA.
The hymns of the Rig Veda inextricably confused; the deities of an earlier era confounded, and again merged together in a pantheism now complete ; the introduction of strange gods ; recognition of a hell of torture ; instead of many divini
ties the One that represents all the gods, and nature as well
;
incantations for evil purposes and charms for a worthy purpose ; formulae of malediction to be directed against ' those whom I hate and who hate me ' ; magical verses to obtain
children, to prolong life, to dispel ' evil magic,' to guard against poison and other ills ; the paralyzing extreme of ritualistic
reverence indicated by the exaltation to godhead of the ' rem
nant ' of sacrifice ; hymns to snakes, to diseases, to sleep, time,
and the stars ; curses on the ' priest-plaguer ' — such, in general outline, is the impression produced by a perusal of the Atharvan
after that of the Rig Veda. How much of this is new ? The Rig Veda is not lacking in incantations, in witchcraft
practices, in hymns to inanimate things, in indications of pantheism. But the general impression is produced, both by the tone of such hymns as these and by their place in the collection, that they are an addition to the original work. On the other hand, in reading the Atharvan hymns the collective
impression is decidedly this, that what to the Rig is adventi
tious is essential to the Atharvan. It has often been pointed out, however, that not only the practices involved, but the hymns themselves, in the Atharvan, may have existed long before they were collected, and that,
while the Atharvan collection, as a whole, takes historical place



152 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
after the Rig Veda, there yet may be comprised in the former much which is as old as any part of the latter work. It is also customary to assume that such hymns as betoken a lower worship (incantations, magical formulae, etc.) were omitted purposely from the Rig Veda to be collected in the Atharvan. That which eventually can neither be proved nor disproved is,
perhaps, best left undiscussed, and it is vain to seek scientific
proof where only historic probabilities are obtainable. Yet, if a closer approach to truth be attractive, even a greater probability will be a gain, and it becomes worth while to consider the
problem a little with only this hope in view. Those portions of the Rig Veda which seem to be Atharvan
like are, in general, to be found in the later books (or places) of the collection. But it would be presumptuous to conclude that a work, although almost entirely given up to what in the
Rig Veda appears to be late, should itself be late in origin.
By analogy, in a nature-religion such as was that of India, the
practice of demonology, witchcraft, etc., must have been an
early factor. But, while this is true, it is clearly impossible to
postulate therefrom that the hymns recording all this array of
cursing, deviltry, and witchcraft are themselves early. The further forward one advances into the labyrinth of Hindu
religions the more superstitions, the more devils, demons,
magic, witchcraft, and uncanny things generally, does he find. Hence, while any one superstitious practice may be antique, there is small probability for assuming a contemporaneous
origin of the hymns of the two collections. The many verses
cited, apparently pell-mell, ' from the Rig Veda, might, it is
true, revert to a version older than that in which they, are found in the Rig Veda, but there is nothing to show that they were not taken from the Rig Veda, and re-dressed in a form that rendered them in many cases more intelligible ; so that
often what is respectfully spoken of as a ' better varied reading' of the Atharvan may be better, as we have said in the intro



THE RELIGION OF THE ATHARVA VEDA. 153
ductory chapter, only in lucidity; and the lucidity be due
to tampering with a text old and unintelligible. Classical examples abound in illustrations.
Nevertheless, although an antiquity equal to that of the whole Rig Veda can by no means be claimed for the Atharvan collection (which, at least in its tone, belongs to the Brahmanic period), yet is the mass represented by the latter, if not con
temporaneous, at any rate so venerable, that it safely may be assigned to a period as old as that in which were composed the
later hymns of the Rik itself. But in distinction from the hymns themselves the weird religion they represent is doubtless
as old, if not older, than that of the Rig Veda. For, while the Rig Vedic soma-c\At is Indo-Iranian, the original Atharvan (fire) cult is even more primitive, and the basis of the work, from this point of view, may have preceded the composition of Rik
hymns. This Atharvan religion — if it may be called so — is, therefore, of exceeding importance. It opens wide the door which the Rik puts ajar, and shows a world of religious and mystical ideas which without it could scarcely have been suspected. Here magic eclipses Soma and reigns supreme. The wizard is greater than the gods; his herbs and amulets are sovereign remedies. Religion is seen on its lowest side. It is true that there is ' bad magic ' and ' good magic ' (the existence of the former is substantiated by the maledictions against it), but what has been received into the collection is apparently the best. To heal the sick and procure desirable things is the
object of most of the charms and incantations — but some of
the desirable things are disease and death of one's foes. On
the higher side of religion, from a metaphysical point of
view, the Atharvan is pantheistic. It knows also the import
ance of the ' breaths,'^ the vital forces ; it puts side by side the
different gods and says that each ' is lord.' It does not lack
philosophical speculation which, although most of it is puerile,
1 XV. I V



154 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sometimes raises questions of wider scope, as when the sage in
quires who made the body with its wonderful parts — implying,
but not stating the argument, from design, in its oldest form.^
Of magical verses there are many, but the content is seldom more than "do thou, O plant, preserve from harm," etc. Harmless enough, if somewhat weak, are also many other hymns calculated to procure blessings
:
Blessings blow to us the wind, Blessings glow to us the sun, Blessings be to us the day, Blest to us the night appear, Blest to us the dawn shall shine,
is a fair specimen of this innocuous sort of verse.^ Another example maybe seen in this hymn to a king: "Firm is the
sky ; firm is the earth ; firm, all creation ; firm, these hills
;
firm the king of the people (shall be)," etc.^ In another hymn there is an incantation to release from possible ill coming from
a foe and from inherited ill or sin/ A free spirit of doubt and atheism, already foreshadowed in the Rig Veda, is implied in the prayer that the god will be merciful to the cattle of that man "whose creed is 'Gods exist.'"* Serpent-worship is not only known, but prevalent.^ The old gods still hold, as always,
their nominal places, albeit the system is pantheistic, so that Varuna is god of waters ; and Mitra with Varuna, gods of rain.' As a starting-point of philosophy the dictum of the Rig Veda is repeated : ' Desire is the seed of mind,' and ' love, i.e., desire, was born first.' Here Aditi is defined anew as the

one in whose lap is the wide atmosphere — she is parent and
child, gods and men, all in all — 'may she extend to us a
triple shelter.' As an example of curse against curse may be compared ii. 7 :
The sin-hated, god-born plant, that frees from the curse as waters (wash out) the spot, has washed away all curses, the curse of my rival and of my sister ; (that) which the Brahman in anger cursed, all this lies under my feet. . . . With this plant protect this (wife), protect my child, protect our property. . . . May the curse return to the curser. . . . We smite even the ribs of the foe with the evil {mantra) eye.
A love-charm in the same book (ii. 30) will remind the classical student of Theocritus' second idyl : 'As the wind twirls around grass upon the ground, so I twirl thy mind about, that thou mayst become loving, that thou mayst not depart from me,' etc. In the following verses the Horsemen gods are invoked to unite the lovers. Characteristic among bucolic passages is the cow-song in ii. 26, the whole intent of which
is to ensure a safe return to the cows on their wanderings : 'Hither may they come, the cattle that have wandered far
away,' etc. The view that there are different conditions of Manes is
clearly taught in xviii. 2. 48-49, where it is said that there are three heavens, in the highest of which reside the Manes ; while a distinction is made at the same time between 'fathers'
and 'grandfathers,' the fathers' fathers, 'who have entered air, who inhabit earth and heaven.' Here appears nascent the doctrine of 'elevating the Fathers,' which is expressly taught in the next era. The performance of rites in honor of the Manes causes them to ascend from a low state to a higher
one In fact, if the offerings are not given at all, the spirits
do not go to heaven. In general the older generations of
Manes go up highest and are happiest. The personal offering
is only to the immediate fathers.



156 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
If, as was shown in the introductory chapter, the Atharvan represents a geographical advance on the part of the Vedic Aryans, this fact cannot be ignored in estimating the primitiveness of the collection. Geographical advance, acquaintance with other flora and fauna than those of the Rig Veda, means

although the argument of silence must not be exaggerated
a temporal advance also. And not less significant are the
points of* view to which one is led in the useful little work of Scherman on the philosophical hymns of the Atharvan. Scherman wishes to show the connection between the Upanishads and Vedas. But the bearing of his collection is toward
a closer union of the two bodies of works, and especially of the Atharvan, not to the greater gain in age of the Upanishads so much as to the depreciation in venerableness of the former. If the Atharvan has much more in common with the Brahmanas and Upanishads than has the Rig Veda, it is because the Atharvan stands, in many respects, midway in time between the era of Vedic hymnology and the thought of the philosophical period. The terminology is that of the Brahmanas, rather than that of the Rig Veda. The latter knows the great person ; the Atharvan, and the former know the original great person, i.e., the causa movens under the causa efficiens, etc. In the Atharvan appears first the worship of Time, Love, ' Support ' (Skambha), and the 'highest brahma.' The cult of the holy cow is fully
recognized (xii. 4 and 5). The late ritualistic terms, as well
as linguistic evidence, confirm the f^ct indicated by the geographical advance. The country is known from western Balkh to eastern Behar, the latter familiarly.^ In a word, one may
conclude that on its higher side the Atharvan is later than the Rig Veda, while on its lower side of demonology one may recognize the religion of the lower classed as compared with
that of the two upper classes — for the latter the Rig Veda, for the superstitious people at large the Atharvan, a collection
1 Compare Muir, OST. ii. 447 ff.



THE RELIGION OF THE ATHARVA VEDA. 157
of which the origin agrees with its application. For, if it at
first was devoted to the unholy side of fire-cult, and if the fire
cult is older than the soma-CM\t, then this is the cult that one
would expect to see most affected by the conservative vulgar, who in India hold fast to what the cultured have long dropped as superstition, or, at least, pretended to drop ; though the house-ritual keeps some magic in its fire-cult. In that case, it may be asked, why not begin the history of Hindu religion with the Atharvan, rather than with the Rig Veda ? Because the Atharvan, as a whole, in its language, social conditions, geography, 'remnant' worship, etc., shows
tHat this literary collection is posterior to the Rik collection. As to individual hymns, especially those imbued with the tone
of fetishism and witchcraft, any one of them, either in its present or original form, may outrank the whole Rik in antiquity,
as do its superstitions the rehgion of the Rik — if it is right
to make a distinction between superstition and religion, meaning by the former a lower, and by the latter a more elevated
form of belief in the supernatural. The difference between the Rik-worshipper and Atharvanworshipper is somewhat like that which existed at a later age between the philosophical ^ivaite and Durgaite. The former revered Qiva, but did not deny the power of a host of lesser mights, whom he was ashamed to worship too much ; the latter granted the all-god-head of ^iva, but paid attention almost
exclusively to some demoniac divinity. Superstition, perhaps, always precedes theology; but as
surely does superstition outlive any one form of its protean rival. And the simple reason is that a theology is the real
belief of few, and varies with their changing intellectual point
of view ; while superstition is the belief unacknowledged ' of the few and acknowledged of the many, nor does it materially
change from age to age. The rites employed among the clamdiggers on the New York coast, the witch-charms they use, the

incantations, cutting of flesh, fire-oblations, meaningless formulae, united with sacrosanct expressions of the church, are all
on a par with the religion of the lower classes as depicted in Theocritus and the Atharvan. If these mummeries and this hocus-pocus were collected into a volume, and set out with • elegant extracts from the Bible, there would be a nineteenth century Atharva Veda. What are the necessary equipment of a Long Island witch? First, "a good hot fire," and then formulae such as this :
^
" If a man is attacked by wicked people and how to banish them : " Bedgoblin and all ye evil spirits, I, N. N., forbid you my
bedstead, my couch ; I, N. N., forbid you in the name of God my house and home ; I fbrbid you in the name of the Holy Trinity my blood and flesh, my body and soul ; I forbid you all the nail-holes in my house and home, till you have travelled over every hill, waded through every water, have counted all
the leaves of every tree, and counted all the stars in the sky,
until the day arrives when the mother of God shall bare her second son." If this formula be repeated three times, with the baptismal name of the person, it will succeed !
"To make one's self invisible:
" Obtain the ear of a black cat, boil it in the milk of a black cow, wear it on the thumb, and no one will see you."
This is the Atharvan, or fire- and witch-craft of to-day — not differing much from the ancient. It is the unchanging founda
tion of the many lofty buildings of faith that are erected,
removed, and rebuilt upon it — the belief in the supernatural at
its lowest, a belief which, in its higher stages, is always level with the general intellect of those that abide in it.
The latest book of the Atharvan is especially for the war
rior-caste, but the mass of it is for the folk at large. It was
1 This old charm is still used among the dam-diggers of Canarsie, N. Y.



THE RELIGION OF THE ATHARVA VEDA. 1S9
long before it was recognized as a legitimate Veda. It never stands, in the older period of Brahmanism, on a par with the Saman and Rik. In the epic period good and bad magic are carefully differentiated, and even to-day the Atharvan is repudiated by southern Brahmans. But tliere is no doubt that
sub rosa, the silliest practices inculcated and formulated in the
Atharvan were the stronghold of a certain class of priests, or that such priests were feared and employed by the laity, openly
by the low classes, secretly by the intelligent.
In respect of the name the magical cult was referred, historically with justice, to the fire-priests, Atharvan and Angiras,
though little application to fire, other than in .rowza-worship, is apparent. Yet was this undoubtedly the source of the cult
(the fire-cult is still distinctly associated with the Atharva Veda in the epic), and the name is due neither to accident
nor to a desire to invoke the names of great seers, as will Weber.^ The other name of Brahmaveda may have connection with the ' false science of Brihaspati,' alluded to in a Upanishad.^
This seer is not over-orthodox, and later he is the patron of the unorthodox Carvakas. It was seen above that the god Brihaspati is also a novelty not altogether relished by the Vedic Aryans. From an Aryan point of view how much weight is to be placed on comparisons of the formulae in the Atharvan of India with those of other Aryan nations? Kuhn has compared^ an old German magic formula of healing with one in the Atharvan, and because each says ' limb to limb ' he thinks that they are of the same origin, particularly since the formula is found in Slussian. The comparison is interesting, but it is far from con
vincing. Such formulae spring up independently all over
the earth.

160 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Finally, it is to be observed that in this Veda first occurs
the implication of the story of the flood (xix. 39. 8), and the saving of Father Manu, who, however, is known by this title in the Rik. The supposition that the story of the flood is derived from Babylon, seems, therefore, to be an unnecessary (although a permissible) hypothesis, as the tale is old enough
in India to warrant a belief in its indigenous origin.'
1 One long hymn, xii. i, of the Atharvan is to earth and fire (19-20). In the Rik, dtharvan is fire-priest and bringer of fire from heaven ; while once the word may mean fire itself (viii. 9, 7). The name Brahmaveda is perhaps best referred to brahma as fire (whence 'fervor,' 'prayer,' and again 'energy,' 'force'). In distinction from the great joma-sacrifices, the fire-cult always remains the chief thing in the domestic ritual. The present Atharvan formulae have for the most part no visible application to fire, but the name still shows the original connection.



CHAPTER VIII.
EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES COMPARED WITH THOSE OF
OTHER ARYANS.
Nothing is more usual than to attempt a reconstruction of Aryan ideas in manners, customs, laws, and religious concep
tions, by placing side by side similar traits of individual Aryan
nations, and stating or insinuating that the result of the com
parison shows that one is handling primitive characteristics of the whole Aryan body. It is of special importance, therefore, to see in how far the views and practices of peoples not Aryan may be found to be identical with those of Aryans. The
division of the army into clans, as in the Iliad and the Veda ; the love of gambling, as shown by Greeks, Teutons, and Hindus ; the separation of captains and princes, as is illus
trated by Teuton and Hindu ; the belief in a flood, common
to Iranian, Greek, and Hindu ; in the place of departed spirits,
with the journey over a river (Iranian, Hindu, Scandinavian,
Greek); in the after-felicity of warriors who die on the field of battle (Scandinavian, Greek, and Hindu); in the reverence paid to the wind-god (Hindu, Iranian, and Teutonic, VataWotan); these and many other traits at different times, by
various writers, have been united and compared to illustrate
primitive Aryan belief and religion. The traits of the Five Nations of the Veda for this reason may be compared very advantageously with the traits of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Indians, the most united and
intelligent of American native tribes. Their institutions are not yet extinct, and they have been described by missionaries of
the 17th century and by some modern writers, to whom can



162 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
be imputed no hankering after Aryan primitive ideas. ^ It is but a few years back since the last avatar of the Iroquois'
incarnate god lived in Onondaga, N. Y. First, as an illustration of the extraordinary development of memory among rhapsodes, Vedic students, and other Aryans ; among the Iroquois " memory was tasked to the utmost, and developed to an extraordinary degree," says Parkman, who adds that they could repeat point by point with precision any address made to them.^ Murder was compromised for by Wchrgeld, as among the Vedic, Iranic, and Teutonic peoples.
The Iroquois, like all Indians, was a great gambler, staking all his property^ (like the Teutons and Hindus). In religion " A mysterious and inexplicable power resides in inanimate
things. . . . Lakes, rivers, and waterfalls [as conspicuously in India] are sometimes the dwelling-place of spirits ; but more
frequently they are themselves living beings, to be propitiated
by prayers and offerings." * The greatest spirit among the Algonquins is the descendant of the moon, and son of the west-wind (personified). After the deluge (thus the Hindus, etc.) this great spirit (Manabozho, mana is Manu?) restored the world ; some asserting that he created the world out of water. But others say that the supreme spirit is the sun (Le J2une, Relation, 1633). The Algonquins, besides a belief in a good spirit (manitmt), had also a belief in a malignant
manitou, in whom the missionaries recognized the devil (why not Ormuzd and Ahriman ?). One tribe invokes the ' Maker of Heaven,' the 'god of waters,' and also the 'seven spirits of the wind' (so, too, seven is a holy number in the Veda, etc.).

;
and the works of Schoolcraft and Parj<man. 2 Jesitiis in N^rth AMerica, Introduction, p. Ixi.

EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES. 163
The Iroquois, like the Hindu (later), believe that the earth
rests on the back of a turtle or tortoise,^ and that this is ruled over by the sun and moon, the first being a good spirit ; the second, malignant. The good spirit interposes between the malice of the moon and mankind, and it is he who makes rivers ; for when the earth was parched, all the water being held back from earth under the armpit of a monster frog, he pierced the armpit and let out the water (exactly as Indra lets out the water held back by the demon). According to some, this great spirit created mankind, but in the third generation a deluge destroyed his posterity.^ The good spirit among the Iroquois is the one that gives good luck (perhaps Bhaga). These Indians believe in the immortality of the soul. Skillful
hunters, brave warriors, go, after death, to the happy huntinggrounds (as in India and Scandinavia); the cowardly and weak are doomed to live in dreary regions of mist and darkness (compare Niflheim and the Iranian eschatology?). To
pass over other religious correspondences, the sacrifice of animals, use of amulets, love-charms, magic, and sorcery, which are all like those of Aryans (to compare, also, are the burying or exposing of the dead and the Hurons' funeral games), let
one take this as a good illustration of the value of ' compar
ative Aryan mythology': According to the Aryan belief the soul of the dead passes
over a stream, across a bridge, past a dog or two, which guard the gate of paradise. The Hindu, Iranian", Greek, and Scandinavian, all have the dog, and much emphasis has been laid -on the ' Aryan ' character of this creed. The native Iroquois
Indians believed that " the spirits on their journey (to heaven)
were beset with difficulties and perils. There was a swift river

164 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
to be crossed on a log that shook beneath the feet, while a ferocious dog opposed their passage." ^ Here is the Persians' narrow bridge, and even Kerberos himself !
It is also interesting to note that, as the Hindus identify
with the sun so many of their great gods, so the Iroquois
" sacrifices to some superior spirit, or to the sun, with which
the superior spirits were constantly confounded by the primitive Indian." ^ Weber holds that because Greek and Hindu gave the name 'bear' to a constellation, therefore this is the "primitive IndoGermanic name of the star." ^ But the Massachusetts Indians " gave their own name for bear to the Ursa major " (Williams'
'Key,' cited Palfrey, I. p. 36 ; so Lafitau, further west).
Again, three, -seven, and even ' thrice-seven,' are holy not only in India but in America. In this new world are found, to go further, the analogues of Varuna in the monotheistic god Viracocha of the Peruvians, to whom is addressed this prayer : " Cause of all things ! ever
present, helper, creator, ever near, ever fortunate one ! Thou
incorporeal one above the sun, infinite, and beneficent";^ of the Vedic Snake of the Deep, in the Mexican Cloud-serpent
;
of the Vedic Lightning-bird, who brings fire from heaven, in the Indian Thunder-bird, who brings fire from heaven ; ^ of the preservation of one individual from a flood (in the epic, Manu's ' Seven Seers ') in the same American myth, even including
the holy mountain, which is still shown ; ^ of the belief that the sun is the home of departed spirits, in the same belief all over

America ; ^ of the belief that stars are the souls of the dead, in the same belief held by the Pampas ; ^ and even of the late
Brahman ic custom of sacrificing the widow (suttee), in the
practice of the Natchez Indians, and in Guatemala, of burning the widow on the pyre of the dead husband.'* The storm wind (Odin) as highest god is found among the Choctaws ; while ' Master of Breath ' is the Creeks' name for this divinity. Huraka (hurricane, ouragon, ourage) is the chief god in Hayti.*
An exact parallel to the vague idea of hell at the close of the
Vedic period, with the gradual increase of the idea, alternating with a theory of reincarnation, may be found in the fact that, in general, there is no notion of punishment after death among the Indians of the New World ; but that, while the good are assisted and cared for after death by the ' Master of Breath,' the Creeks believe that the liar, the coward, and the niggard
(Vedic sinners par excelleyice f) are left to shift for themselves in darkness ; whereas the Aztecs believed in a hell surrounded by the water called 'Nine Rivers,' guarded by a dog and a dragon; and the great Eastern American tribes believe that
after the soul has been for a while in heaven it can, if it chooses,
return to earth and be born again as a man, utilizing its old
bones (which are, therefore, carefully preserved by the surviv
ing members of the family) as a basis for a new body.^ To turn to another foreign religion, how tempting would it be to see in Nutar the ' abstract power ' of the Egyptian, an analogue of brahma and the other ' power ' abstractions of India
;
to recognize Brahma in El ; and in Nu, sky, and expanse of waters, to see Varuna ; especially when one compares the boatjourney of the Vedic seer with Ra's boat in Egypt. Or, again, in the twin children of Ra to see the Agvins ; and to associate

166 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the mundane egg of the Egyptians v^Jith that of the Brahmans.^ Certainly, had the Egyptians been one of the Aryan famihes, all these conceptions had been referred long ago to the cate
gory of ' primitive Aryan ideas.' But how primitive is a certain
religious idea will not be shown by simple comparison of Aryan
parallels. It will appear more often that it is not ' primitive,'
but, so to speak, per-primitive, aboriginal with no one race, but with the race of man. When we come to describe the religions of the wild tribes of India it will be seen that among them also are found traits common, on the one hand, to the Hindu, and on the other to the wild tribes of America. With this warning in mind one may inquire at last in how far a conservative judgment can find among the Aryans themselves an identity
of original conception in the different forms of divinities and
religious rites. Foremost stand the universal chrematheism, worship of inanimate objects regarded as usefully divine, and
the cult of the departed dead. This latter is almost universal, perhaps pan-Aryan, and Weber is probably right in assuming that the primitive Aryans believed in a future life. But
Benfey's identification of Tartaras with the Sanskrit Talatala, the name of a special hell in very late systems of cosmogony, is decidedly without the bearing he would put upon it. The Sanskrit word may be taken directly from the Greek, but of an Aryan source for both there is not the remotest historical
probability. When, however, one comes to the Lord of the Dead he finds himself already in a narrower circle. Yama is the Persian Yima, and the name of Kerberos may have been once an adjective applied to the dog that guarded the path to paradise ; but other particular conceptions that gather about each god point only to a period of Indo-Iranian unity. Of the great nature-gods the sun is more than Aryan, but doubtless was Aryan, for Surya is Helios, but Savitar is a
1 Renouf, Religion of Ancient Egypt, pp. 103, 113 ff.



EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES. 167
development especially Indian. Dyaus-pitar is Zsiis-pater, Jupiter.^ Trita, scarcely Triton, is the Persian Thraetaona who conquers Vritra, as does Indra in India. The last, on the
other hand, is to be referred only hesitatingly to the demon Andra of the Avesta. Varuna, despite phonetic difficulties, probably is Ouranos ; but Asura (Asen ?) is a title of many gods in India's first period, while the corresponding Ahura is
restricted to the good spirit, ko-t eioxqv. The seven Adityas
are reflected in the Amesha Cpentas of Zoroastrian Puritanism,
but these are mere imitations, spiritualized and moralized into abstractions. Bhaga is Slavic Bogu and Persian Bagha ; Mitra is Persian Mithra. The Agvins are all but in name the Greek gods Dioskouroi, and correspond closely in detail (riding on
horses, healing and helping, originally twins of twilight). Tacitus gives a parallel Teutonic pair (Germ. 43). Ushas, on the other hand, while etymologically corresponding to Aurora, Eos, is a specially Indian development, as Eos has no cult. Vata, Wind, is an aboriginal god, and may perhaps be Wotan, Odin.^
Parjanya, the rain-god, as Biihler has shown, is one with Lithuanian Perkuna, and with the northern Fiogyu. The ' fashioner,' Tvashtar (sun) is only Indo-Iranian ; Thwasha
probably being the same word. Of lesser mights, Angiras, name of fire, may be Persian angaros, 'fire-rnessenger ' (compare ayyeXos), perhaps originally one with Sk. angara, ' coal.' ^ Hebe has been identified with yavya, young woman, but this word is enough to show that Hebe has naught to do with the Indian pantheon. The Gandharva, moon, is certainly one with the Persian Gandarewa, but can hardly be identical with the Centaur. Sarama seems to have, together with Sarameya, a Grecian parallel development in

168 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Helena (a goddess in Sparta), Selene, Hermes ; and Saranyu may be the same with Erinnys, but these are not Aryan figures in the form of their respective developments, though
they appear to be so in origin. It is scarcely possible that
Earth is an Aryan deity with a cult, though different Aryan (and un-Aryan) nations regarded her as divine. The Maruts are especially Indian and have ho primitive identity as gods with Mars, though the names may be radically connected. The fire-priests, Bhrigus, are supposed to be one with the
^\i.yv3.L. The fact that the fate of each in later myth is to visit hell would presuppose, however, an Aryan notion of a
torture-hell, of which the Rig Veda has no concepti'on. The
Aryan identity of the two myths is thereby made uncertain,
if not implausible. The special development in India of the fire-priest that brings down fire from heaven, when com
pared with the personification of the ' twirler ' (Promantheus)
in Greece, shows that no detailed myth was current in primi
tive times. ^ The name of the fire-priest, brahman = fla(g)men(?),
is an indication of the primitive fire-cult in antithesis to the
soma-c\Ai, which latter belongs to the narrower circle of the Hindus and Persians. Here, however, in the identity of names
for sacrifice (^yajha, ya^na) and of barhis, the sacrificial straw,
of soma = haoma, together with many other liturgical similarities, as in the case of the metres, one must recognize a fully developed soma-cvXt prior to the separation of the Hindus and
Iranians. Of demigods of evil type the Ydtus are both Hindu and Iranian, but the priest-names of the one religion are evil names
in the other, as the devas, gods, of one are the daeiias, demons,
of the other.^ There are no other identifications that seem at
1 But the general belief that fire (Agni, ignis, Slavic ogni) was first brought to earth from heaven by a half-divine personality is (at least) Aryan, as Kuhn has shown. 2 Compare the kavis and u^ijs (poets and priests) of the Veda with the evil spirits
of the same names in the Avesta, like daeva = deva. Compare, besides, the Indo^ Iranian feasts, medha, that accompany this Bacchanalian liquor-worship.



EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES. 169
all certain in the strict province of religion, although in myth the form of Manus, who is the Hindu Noah, has been associated with Teutonic Mannus, and Greek Minos, noted in Thucydides for his- sea-faring. He is to Yama (later regarded as his brother) as is Noah to Adam.
We do not lay stress on lack of equation in proper names, but, as Schrader shows (p. 596 ff.), very few comparisons on this line have a solid phonetic foundation. Minos, Manu ; Ouranos, Varuna ; Wotan, Vata, are dubious ; and some equate flamen with blotan, sacrifice.
Other wider or narrower comparisons, such as Neptunus from ndpdt apam, seem to us too daring to be believed. Apollo {sapary), Aphrodite (Apsaras), Artamis (non-existent rtamd!), Pan {pavana), have been cleverly compared, but the identity of forms has scarcely been proved. Nor is it important for the comparative mythologist that Okeanus is ' lying around
'
(afdydnd). More than that is necessary to connect Ocean mythologically with the demon that surrounds (swallows) the
waters of the sky. The Vedic parallel is rather Rasa, the far
off great 'stream.' It is rarely that one finds Aryan equivalents
in the land of fairies and fays. Yet are the Hindu clever
artizan Ribhus-' our 'elves,' who, even to this day, are distinct from fairies in their dexterity and cleverness, as every wise child knows. But animism, as simple spiritism, fetishism, perhaps ancestor-worship, and polytheism, with the polydaemonism that may be called chrematheism, exists from the beginning of the religious history, undisturbed by the proximity of theism, pantheism, or atheism ; exactly as to-day in the Occident, be
side theism and atheism, exist spiritism and fetishi3m (with their inherent magic), and even ancestor-worship, as implied by the reputed after-effect of parental curses.
1 Ludwig interprets the three Ribhus as the three seasons personified. Etymologically connected is Orpheus, perhaps.



170 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
When the circle is narrowed to that of the Indo-Iranian connection the similarity in religion between the Veda and Avesta becomes much more striking than in any other group, as has been shown. It is here that the greatest discrepancy
in opinion obtains among modern scholars. Some are inclined
to refer all that smacks of Persia to a remote period of IndoIranian unity, and, in consequence, to connect all tokens of contact with the west with far-away regions out of India. It
is scarcely possible that such can be the case. But, on the
other hand, it is unhistorical to connect, as do some scholars, the worship of soma and Varuna with a remote period of unity, and then with a jump to admit a close connection between Veda and Avesta in the Vedic period. The Vedic Aryans appear to have lived, so to speak, hand in glove with the
Iranians for a period long enough for the latter to share in that advance of Varuna-worship from polytheism to quasimonotheism which is seen in the Rig Veda. This worship of Varuna as a superior god, with his former equals ranged under
him in a group, chiefly obtains in that family (be it of priest
or tribe, or be the two essentially one from a religious point of view) which has least to do with pure WOTS-worship, the inherited Indo-Iranian cult ; and the Persian Ahura, with the six spiritualized equivalents of the old Vedic Adityas, can have come into existence only as a direct transformation of the
latter cult, which in turn is later than the cult that developed
in one direction as chief of gods a Zeus ; in another, a Bhaga
;
in a third, an Odin. On the other hand, in the gradual change
in India of Iranic gods to devils, asuras, there is an exact coun
terpart to the Iranian change of meaning from deva to daeva. But if this be the connection, it is impossible to assume a long break between India and the west, and then such a sudden tie as is indicated by the allusions in the Rig Veda to the Persians and other western lands. The most reasonable view, therefore, appears to be that the Vedic and Iranian Aryans



EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES. 171
were for a long time in contact, that the contact began to cease as the two peoples separated to east and west, but that after the two peoples separated communication was sporadically kept up between them by individuals in the way of trade or
otherwise. This explains the still surviving relationship as it
is found in later hymns and in thank-offerings apparently involving Iranian personages.
They that believe in a monotheistic Varuna-cult preceding the Vedic polytheism must then ignore the following facts : The Slavic e_quivalent of Bhaga and the Teutonic equivalent of Vata are to these respective peoples their highest gods. They
had no Varuna. Moreover, there is not the slightest proof that Ouranos in Greece ' was ever a god worshipped as a great god before Zeus, nor is there any probability that to the Hindu
Dyaus Pitar was ever a great god, in the sense that he ever had a special cult as supreme deity. He is physically great,
and physically he is father, as is Earth mother, but he is reli
giously great only in the Hellenic-Italic circle, where exists no
Uranos-cult.^ Rather is it apparent that the Greek raised Zeus, as did the Slav Bhaga, to his first head of the pantheon. Now when one sees that in the Vedic period Varuna is the type of Adityas, to which belong Bhaga and Mitra as distinctly less important personages, it is plain that this can mean only that Varuna has gradually been exalted to his position at the expense of the other gods. Nor is there perfect uniformity between Persian and Hindu conceptions. Asura in the Veda is not apphed to Varuna alone. But in the Avesta, Ahura is
the one great spirit, and his six spirits are plainly a protestant
copy and modification of Varuna and his six underlings. This,
then, can mean — which stands in concordance with the other

parallels between the two religions — only that Zarathustra borrows the Ahura idea from the Vedic Aryans at a time when Varuna was become superior to the other gods, and when the Vedic cult is estabhshed in its second phase. ^ To this fact points also the evidence that shows how near together geographically were once the Hindus and Persians. Whether one puts the place of separation at the Kabul or further to the north-west is a matter of indifference. The Persians borrow the idea of Varuna Asura, whose eye is the sun. They spiritualize this, and create an Asura unknown to other
nations. Of von Bradke's attempt to prove an original Dyaus Asura we have said nothing, because the attempt has failed signally. He imagines that the epithet Asura was given to Dyaus in the Indo-Irahian period, and that from a Dyaus Pitar Asura the Iranians made an abstract Asura, while the Hindus raised the other gods and depressed Dyaus Pitar Asura ; whereas it
is quite certain that Varuna (Asura) grew up, out, and over the other Asuras, his former equals. And yet it is almost a pity to spend time to demonstrate that Varuna-worship was not monotheistic originally. We gladly admit that, even if not a primitive monotheistic deity, Varuna ytX is a god that belongs to a very old period of Hindu
literature. And, for a worship so antique, how noble is the idea, how exalted is the completed conception of him ! Truly, the Hindus and Persians alone of Aryans mount nearest to the high level of Hebraic thought. For Varuna beside the loftiest figure in the Hellenic pantheon stands like a god
beside a man. The Greeks had, indeed, a surpassing aesthetic taste, but in grandeur of religious ideas even the daring of Aeschylus becomes but hesitating bravado when compared with the serene boldness of the Vedic seers, who, first of their race, out of many gods imagined God.

In regard to eschatology, as in regard to myths, it has been
shown that the utmost caution in identification is called for. It may be surmised that such or such a belief or legend is in origin one with a like faith or tale of other peoples. But
the question whether it be one in historical origin or in universal mythopoetic fancy, and this latter be the only common origin, must remain in almost every case unanswered.^ This is by far not so entertaining, nor so picturesque a solution as is the explanation of a common historical basis for any two legends, with its inspiring 'open sesame' to the door of the
locked past. But which is truer ? Which accords more with the facts as they are collected from a wider field ? As man in the process of development, in whatever quarter of earth he be located, makes for himself independently clothes, language, and gods, so he makes myths that are more or less like those of other peoples, and it is only when names coincide
and traits that are unknown elsewhere are strikingly similar in any two mythologies that one has a right to argue a prob
able community of origin. But even if the legend of the flood were Babylonian, and
the Asuras as devils were due to Iranian influence — which can
neither be proved nor disproved — the fact remains that the Indian religion in its main features is of a purely native
character. As the most prominent features of the Vedic religion must be regarded the worship of soma, of nature-gods that are in
part already more than this, of spirits, and of the Manes ; the acknowledgment of a moral law and a belief in a life hereafter. There is also a vaguer nascent belief in a creator apart from
1 Spiegel holds that the whole idea of future punishment is derived from Persia (Eranische Alterihumskimde, i. p. 45S), but his point of view is naturally prejudiced. The allusion to the supposed Babylonian coin, manS, in RV. viii. 78. 2, would indicate that the relation with Babylon is one of trade, as with Aegypt. The account of the flood may be drawn thence, so may the story of Deucalion, but both Hindu and Hellenic versions may be as native as is that of the American redskins.



174 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
any natural phenomenon, but the' creed for the most part is poetically, indefinitely, stated: 'Most wonder-working of the wonder-working gods, who made heaven and earth ' (as above). The corresponding Power is Cerus in Cerus-Creator (Kronos ?), although when a name is given, the Maker, Dhatar, is employed ; while Tvashtar, the artificer, is more an epithet of the sun than
of the unknown creator. The personification of Dhatar as cre
ator of the sun, etc., belongs to later Vedic times, and foreruns
the Father-god of the last Vedic period. Not till the classical age (below) is found a formal identification of the Vedic nature-gods with the departed Fathers (Manes). Indra, for example, is invoked in the Rig Veda to 'be a friend, be a
father, be more fatherly than the fathers '; but this implies
no patristic side in Indra, who is called in the same hymn
(vs. 4) the son of Dyaus (his father); and Dyaus Pitar no more implies, as say some sciolists, that Dyaus was regarded as a human ancestor than does 'Mother Earth' imply a belief that Eirth is the ghost of a dead woman.
In the Veda there is a nature-religion and an ancestor-religion. These approach, but do not unite ; they are felt as sundered beliefs. Sun-myths, though by some denied in toto, appear plainly in the Vedic hymns. Dead heroes may be gods, but gods, too, are natural phenomena, and, again, they are abstractions. He that denies any one of these sources of godhead is ignorant of India.
Miiller, in his Andent Sanskrit LiUrature, has divided Vedic
literature into four periods, that of chandas, songs ; mantras,
texts; brahmanas ; and sutras. The manttas are in distinc
tion from chandas, the later hymns to the earlier gods.^ The
latter distinction can, however, be established only on subjective grounds, and, though generally unimpeachable, is some
times liable to reversion. Thus, Miiller looks upon RV.
viii. 30 as 'simple and primitive,' while others see in this

EARLY HINDU DIVINITIES. 175
hymn a late mantra. Between the Rig Veda and the Brahmanas, which are in prose, lies a period filled out in part by the present form of the Atharva Veda, which, as has been shown, is a Veda of the low cult that is almost ignored by the Rig Veda, while it contains at the same time much that is later than the Rig Veda, and consists of old and new together in a manner entirely conformable to the state of every other Hindu work of early times. After this epoch
there is found in the liturgical period, into which extend the later portions of the Rig Veda (noticeably parts of the
first, fourth, eighth, and tenth books), a religion which, in
spiritual tone, in metaphysical speculation, and even in the
interpretation of some of the natural divinities, differs not more from the bulk of the Rig Veda than does the social status of the time from that of the earlier text. Religion has become,
in so far as the gods are concerned, a ritual. But, except in the building up of a Father-god, theology is at bottom not much altered, and the eschatological conceptions remain about as they were, despite a preHminary sign of the doctrine of metempsychosis. In the Atharva Veda, for the first time, hell is known by its later name (xii. 4. 36), and perhaps its tortures
;
but the idea of future punishment appears plainly first in the Brahmanic period. Both the doctrine of re-birth and that of
hell appear in the earliest Sutras, and consequently the assumption that these dogmas come from Buddhism does not appear to be well founded ; for it is to be presumed whatever religious
belief is established in legal Hterature will have preceded that
literature by a considerable period, ce;-tainly by a greater length of time than that which divides the first Brahmanic law
from Buddhism.



CHAPTER IX.
BRAHMANISM.
Besides the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda there are two
others, called respectively the Sama Veda and the Yajur Veda.^
The former consists of a small collection of verses, which are taken chiefly from the eighth and ninth books of the Rig Veda, and are arranged for singing. It has a few more verses than are contained in the corresponding parts of the Rik, but the whole is of no added importance from the present point of
view. It is of course made entirely for the ritual. Also made
for the ritual is the Yajur Veda, the Veda of sacrificial formulae. But this Veda is far more important. With it one is brought into a new land, and into a world of ideas that are strange to the Rik. The period represented by it is a sort of bridge between the Rik and the Brahmanas. The Yajus is later than Rik or Atharvan, belonging in its entirety more to the age of the liturgy than to the older Vedic era. With the Brahmanas not only is the tone changed from that of the Rig Veda ; the whole moral atmosphere is now surcharged with
hocus-pocus, mysticism, religiosity, instead of the cheerful, real
religion which, however formal, is the soul of the Rik. In the Brahmanas there is no freshness, no poetry. There is in some regards a more scrupulous outward morality, but for the rest
there is only cynicism, bigotry, and dullness. It is true that
each of these traits may be found in certain parts of the Rig
1 In Aii. Br. i. 22, there is an unexplained antithesis of Rik, Yajus, Saman, Veda, and Brahma ; where the commentator'takes Veda to be Atharva Veda. The priests, belonging respectively to the first three Vedas, are for the Rig Veda, the Hotar priest, who recites; for the Saman, the Udgatar, 'the singer'; for the Yajus, the Adhvaryu, who attends to the erection of the altar, etc. Compare MUUer, ASL. p. 468.



BRAHMANISM. 177
Veda, but it is not true that they represent there the spirit of the age, as they do in the Brahmanic period. Of this Brahmanic stoa, to which we now turn, the Yajur Veda forms the fitting entrance. Here the priest is as much lord as he is in the
Brahmanas. Here the sacrifice is only the act, the sacrificial forms {yajus), without the spirit.
In distinction from the verse-Veda (the Rik), the Yajur Veda
contains the special formulae which the priest that attends to the erection of the altar has to speak, with explanatory remarks added thereto. This of course stamps the collection as mechan
ical ; but the wonder is that this collection, with the similar Brahmana scriptures that follow it, should be the only new literature which centuries have to show.^ As explanatory of the sacrifice there is found, indeed, a good deal of legendary stuff, which sometimes has a literary character. But nothing
is for itself ; everything is for the correct performance of the
sacrifice.^
The geographical centre is now changed, and instead of the Punjab, the ' middle district ' becomes th^ seat of culture. Nor is there much difference between the district to which can be referred the rise of the Yajur Veda and that of the Brahmanas. No less altered is the religion. All is now symbolical,
and the gods, though in general they are the gods of the -Rig
Veda, are not the same as of old. The priests have become
gods. The old appellation of ' spirit,' asiira, is confined to evil spirits. There is no longer any such ' henotheism ' as that of the Rig Veda. The Father-god, ' lord of beings,' or simply
' the father,' is the chief god. The last thought of the Rig
1 It is the only literature of its time except (an important exception) those forerunners of later Siitra and epic which one may suppose to be in process of formation long before they come to the front, 2 There are several schools of this Veda, of which the chief are the Vajasaneyi, or ' White Yajus,' collection ; the Taittiriya collection ; and the Maitrayani collection
;
the first named being the latest though the most popular, the last two being the foremost representatives of the ' Black Yajus.'



178 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Veda is the first thought of the Yajur Veda. Other changes have taken place. The demigods of the older period, the water-nymphs of the Rik, here become seductive goddesses, whose increase of power in this art agrees with the decline of
the warrior spirit that is shown too in the whole mode of think
ing. Most important is the gradual rise of Vishnu and the first appearance of Qiva. Here hrahma, which in the Rik has the meaning ' prayer ' alone, is no longer mere prayer, but, as in
later literature,Jioliness. In short, before the Brahmanas are
reached they are perceptible in the near distance, in the Veda of Formulae, the Yajus ;' for between the Yajur Veda and the
Brahmanas there is no essential difference. The latter consist of explanations of the sacrificial liturgy, interspersed with
legends, bits of history, philosophical explanations, and other
matter more or less related to the subject. They are completed by the ForestJBooks, Aranyakas, which contain the speculations of the later theosophy, the Upanishads (below). It is with
the Yajur Veda and its nearly related literature, the Brah
manas, that Brahmanism really begins. Of these latter the most important in age and content are the Brahmanas (of the Rig Veda and Yajur Veda), called Aitareya and Qata-patha, the former representing the western district, the latter, in great
part, a more eastern region.
Although the 'Northerners' are still respectfully referred to,
yet, as we have just said, the people among whom arose the Brahmanas are not settled in the Punjab, but in the country called the ' middle district,' round about the modern Delhi. For the most part the Punjab is abandoned ; or rather, the literature of this period does not emanate frOm the Aryans that remained in the Punjab, but from the still emigrating descendants of the old Vedic people that used to live there. Some stay behind and keep the older practices, not in all
1 The different traits here recorded are given with many illustrative examples by Schroeder, in his Liieraiiir iind Cultiir^ p. 90 ff.



AHMAXISM. 179
regards looked upon as orthodox by their more advanced brethren, who have pushed east and now live in the country called the land of the Kurus and Pancalas.^ They are spread farther east, along the banks of the Jumna and Ganges, south of Nepal; while some are still about and south of the holy KuruksHetra or 'plain of Kurus.' East of the middle district the Kosalas and Videhas form, in opposition to the Kurus and PancalaSj the second great tribe (Tirhut). There are now two
sets of ' Seven Rivers,' and the holiness of the western group is perceptibly lessened. Here for the first time are found the
Fra/j'fl-hymns, intended to initiate into the Brahmanic order Aryans who have not conformed to it, and speak a dialectic language." From the point of view of language and geography,
no less than from that of the social and spiritual conditions, it is evident that quite a period has elapsed since the body of the Rig Veda was composed. The revealed texts are now ancient storehouses of wisdom. Religion has apparently become a form ; in some regards it is a farce. " There are two kinds of gods ; for the gods are gods, and priests that are learned in the Veda and teach it are human gods." This sentence, from one of the most important Hindu prose works, ^ is the key to the religion of the period which it represents ; and it is fitly followed by the further statement,
that like sacrifice to the gods are the fees paid to the human gods the priests.^ Yet with this dictum, so important for the
1 Compare Weber, Ind. Strcifcn^ ii. 197. 2 Websr, Lit. p. ']y 8 The Cata-patha Brahmana (or " Brahmana of the hundred paths") ii. 2. 2. 6;
4. 3. 14. ^ The chief family priest, it is said in the Cat. Br. ii. 4. 4. 5, is a man of great influence. Sometimes one priest becomes religious head of two clans (an extraordinary event, however ; only one name is reported) and then how exalted is his position. Probably, as in the later age of the drama, the chief priest was often at the same time practically prime minister. It is said in another part of the same book that although the whole earth is divine, yet it is the priest that makes holy the place of sacrifice (iii. i. I. 4). In this period murder is defined as killing a priest ; other cases are not called murder. Weber, IS. x. 66.



180 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
understanding of the religion of the age, must be joined an
other, if one would do that age full justice : ' The sacrifice is
like a ship sailing heavenward ; if there be a sinful priest in
it, that one priest would make it sink' {Cat. Br. iv. 2. 5. 10). For although the time is one in which ritualism had, indeed, 'become more important than religion, and the priest more
^1 important than the gods, yet is there no lack of reverential ' feeling, nor is morality regarded as unimportant. The first impression, however, which is gained from the literature of
this period is that the sacrifice is all in all ; that the endless
details of its course, and the petty questions in regard to its
arrangement, are not only the principal objects of care and of chief moment, but even of so cardinal importance that the whole religious spirit swings upon them. But such is not
altogether the case. It is the truth, yet is it not the whole
truth, that in these Brahmanas religion is an appearance, not a reality. The sacrifice is indeed represented to be the only
door to prosperity on earth and to future bliss ; but there is a
quiet yet persistent belief that at bottom a moral and religious
life is^uite as essential as are the ritualistic observances with which worship is accompanied. To describe Brahmanism as implying a religion that is purely one of ceremonies, one composed entirely of observances, is therefore not altogether correct. In reading a liturgical work it must not be forgotten for what the work was intended. If
its object be simply to inculcate a special rite, one cannot demand that it should show breadth of view or elevation of sentiment. Composed of observances every work must be of which the aim is to explain observances. In point of fact, religion (faith and moral behavior) is here assumed, and so entirely is it taken for granted that a statement emphasizing the necessity of godliness is seldom found.
Nevertheless, having called attention to the religious spirit that lies latent in the pedantic Brahmanas, we are willing to



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 181
admit that the age is overcast, not only with a thick cloud of ritualism, but also with an unpleasant mask of phariseeism. There cannot have been quite so much attention paid to the outside of the platter without neglect of the inside. And it is
true that the priests of this period strive more for the comple
tion of their rites than for the perfection of themselves. It is true, also, that occasionally there is a revolting contempt for
those people who are not of especial service to the priest.
There are now two godlike aristocrats, the priest and the noble. The 'people' are regarded as only fit to be the "food of the nobility." In the symbolical language of the time the bricks
of the altar, which are consecrated, are the warrior caste ; the
fillings, in the space between the bricks, are not consecrated; and
these "fillers of space " are " the people " (J^at. Br. vi. i. 2. 25).
Yet is religion in these books not dead, but sleeping; to wake again in the Upanishads with a fuller spiritual life than is found in any other pre-Christian system. Although the subject matter of the Brahmanas is the cult, yet are there found in them numerous legends, moral teachings, philosophical fancies,
historical items, etymologies and other adventitious matter, all
of which are helpful in giving a better understanding of the
intelligence of the people to whom is due all the extant litera
ture of the period. Long citations from these ritualistic pro
ductions would have a certain value, in showing in native form the character of. the works, but they would make unendurable reading ; and we have thought it better to arrange the multifarious contents of the chief Brahmanas in a sort of order, although it is difficult always to decide where theology ends and moral teachings begin, the two are here so interwoven.
BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE.
While in general the pantheon of the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda is that of the Brahmanas, some of the older gods are



182 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
now reduced in importance, and, on tlie other hand, as in the Yajur Veda, some gods are seen to be growing in importance. 'Time,' deified in the Atharvan, is a great god, but beside him
still stand the old rustic divinities ; and chrematheism, which
antedates even the Rig Veda, is still recognized. To the ' ploughshare ' and the ' plough ' the Rig Veda has an hymn
(iv. 57. 5-8), and so the ritual gives them a cake at the sacri
fice (^Qmtdftrya, Qat. Br. ii. 6. 3. 5). The number of the gods,
in the Rig Veda estimated as thirty-three, or, at the end of this
period, as thousands, remains as doubtful as ever ; but, in
general, all groups of deities become greater in number. Thus, in TS. i. 4. 11. i, the Rudras alone are counted as
thirty-three instead of eleven; and, ib. v. 5. 2. 5, the eight Vasus become three hundred and thirty-three ; but it is elsewhere hinted that the number of the gods stands in the
same relation to that of men as that in which men stand to
the beasts ; that is, there are not quite so many gods as men
(f«/. Br. ii. 3. 2. 18). Of more importance than the addition of new deities is the subdivision of the old. As one finds in Greece a Zeis Kara
)(Q6vio^ beside a Zt-us iivio'i, so in the Yajur Veda and Brah
manas are found (an extreme instance) hail ' to Kaya,' and
hail ' to Kasmai,' that is, the god Ka is differentiated into two
divinities, according as he is declined as a noun or as a pronoun ; for this is the god " Who .' " as the dull Brahmanas interpreted that verse of the Rig Veda which asks 'to whom
(which, as) god shall we offer sacrifice?' (Mait. S. iii. 12. 5.) But ordinarily one divinity like Agni is subdivided, according
to his functions, as 'lord of food;' 'lord of prayer,' etc.^ In the Brahmanas different names are given to the chief god, but he is most often called the Father-god (Prajapati,
' lord of creatures,' or the Father, ///«). His earlier Vedic type
is Brihaspati, the lord of strength, and, from another point of
1 Earth, loc. cii. p, 42.



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 183
view, the All-god.^ The other gods fall into various groups, the most significant being the triad of Fire, Wind, and Sun.^
Not much weight is to be laid on the theological speculations
of the time as indicative of primitive conceptions, although they may occasionally hit true. For out of the number of inane fancies it is reasonable to suppose that some might coin" aide with historic facts. Thus the All-gods of the Rig Veda,
by implication, are of later origin than the other gods, and this,
very likely, was the case ; but it is a mere guess on the part of
the priest. The Qatapatha, iii. 6. i. 28, speaks of the All-gods
as gods that gained immortality on a certain occasion, i.e., became immortal like other gods. So the Adityas go to heaven before the Angirasas {Ait. Br. iv. 17), but this has no such
historical importance as some scholars are inclined to think. The lesser gods are in part carefully grouped and numbered, in a manner somewhat contradictory to what must have been the earlier belief. Thus the ' three kinds of gods ' are now
Vasus, of earth, Rudras, of air, and Adityas, of sky, and the daily offerings are divided between them ; the morning oifering belonging only to the Vasus, the mid-day one only to (Indra and) the Rudras, the third to the Adityas with the Vasus and Rudras together.^ Again, the morning and mid-day pressing
belong to the gods alone, and strict rule is observed in dis
tinguishing their portion from that of the Manes {Qat. Br. iv. 4. 22). The difference of sex is quite ignored, so that the
' universal Agni ' is identified with (mother) earth ; as is also,
once or twice, Pushan {ib. iii. 8. 5. 4 ; 2. 4. 19 ; ii. 5. 4. 7). As
the ' progenitor,' Agni facilitates connubial union, and is called
" the head god, the progenitor among gods, the lord of beings "
(ib. iii. 4. 3. 4; iii. 9. i. 6). Pushan is interpreted to mean
1 He has analogy with Agni in being made of 'seven persons (males),' Cat. Br.

184 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
cattle, and Brihaspati is the priestly caste (ib. iii. 9. i. 10 ff.). The base of comparison is usually easy to find. ' The earth nourishes,' and ' Pushan nourishes,' hence Pushan is the earth
;
or ' the earth belongs to all ' and Agni is called ' belonging to
air (universal), hence the two are identified. The All-gods, merely on account of their name, are now the All ; Aditi is the
'unbounded' earth {ib. iii. 9. i. 13; iv. i. i. 23; i. i. 4. 5 ; iii.
2. 3. 6). Agni represents all the gods, and he is the dearest,
the closest, and the surest of all the gods {ib. i. 6. 2. 8 ff.).
It is said that man on earth fathers the fire (that is, protects it),
and when he dies the fire that he has made his son on earth becomes his father, causing him to be reborn in heaven {ib. ii.
3- 3- 3-5; vi. I. 2. 26). The wives of the gods {devanam patnlr yajati), occasionally mentioned in the Rig Veda, have now an established place and
cult apart from that of the gods {ib. i. 9. 2. 11). The fire on the hearth is god Agni in person, and is not a divine or mystic type ; but be is prayed to as a heavenly friend. Some of these traits are old, but they are exaggerated as compared with the more ancient theology. When one goes on a journey or returns from one, ' even if a king were in his house ' he should
not greet him till he makes homage to his hearth-fires, either with spoken words or with silent obeisance. For Agni and
Prajapati are one, they are son and father {ib. ii. 4. i. 3, 10; vi. I. 2. 26). The gods have mystic names, and these 'who will dare to speak.?' Thus, Indra's mystic name is Arjuna
{ib. ii. I. 2. 11). In the early period of the Rig Veda the priest dares to speak. The pantheism of the end of the Rig Veda is here decided and plain-spoken, as it is in the Atharvan.
As- it burns brightly or not the fire is in turn identified with
different gods, Rudra, Varuna, Indra, and Mitra {ib. ii. 3. 2. 9 ff.).
Agni is all the gods and the gods are in men {ib. iii. i. 3. i ;
4. I. ig ; ii. 3. 2. I : Indra and King Yama dwell in men). And, again, the Father (Prajapati) is the All; he is the year



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 185
of twelve months and five seasons {ib. i. 3. 5. 10). Then follows a characteristic bit. Seventeen verses are to be recited to correspond to the ' seventeenfold ' Prajapati. But 'some say' twenty-one verses; and he may recite twenty-one, for if ' the three worlds ' are added to the above seventeen one gets twenty, and the sun {ya esa tapati) makes the twenty-first ! As
to the number of worlds, it is said {ib. i. 2. 4. 11, 20-21) that there are three worlds, and possibly a fourth.
Soma is now the moon, but as being one half of Vritra, the evil demon. The other half became the belly of creatures
{ib. i. 6. 3. 17). Slightly different is the statement that Soma
was Vritra, iv. 2. 5. 15. In Ait. Br. i. 27, King Soma is bought of the Gandharvas by Vac, ' speech,' as a cow.^ With phases of
the moon Indra and Agni are identified. One is the deity
of the new ; the other, of the full moon ; while Mitra is the waning, and Varuna the waxing moon {Qat. Br. ii. 4. 4. 17-18). This opposition of deities is more fully expressed in the at
tempt to make antithetic the relations of the gods and the Manes, thus : ' The gods are represented by spring, summer, and rains ; the Fathers, by autumn, winter, and the dewy season ; the gods, by the waxing ; the Fathers, by the waning
moon ; the gods, by day ; the Fathers, by night ; the gods, by morning; the Fathers, by afternoon' {Qat. Br. ii. i. 31; ib. ii. 4. 2. iff.: 'The sun is the light of the gods; the moon, of the Fathers ; fire, of men'). Between morning and afternoon, as representative of gods and Manes respectively, stands midday, which, according to the same authority (ii. 4. 2. 8), represents men. The passage first cited continues thus : ' The seasons are gods and Fathers ; gods are immortal ; the Fathers
1 Interesting is the fact that only priests may eat sacrificial food and drink soma at this period. When even the king should drink soma, he is made to drink some transubstantiated liquor which, the priests inform him, has been ' made into soma' for him by magic, for the latter is too holy for any warrior really to drink (vii. 19; viii. 20). But in the more popular feasts there are indications that this rule is often broken. Compare Weber, RSjasfiya p. 98.



186 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
are mortal.' In regard to the relation between spring and the
other seasons, the fifth section of this passage may be compared : ' Spring is the priesthood ; summer, the warrior-caste ;
the rains are the (z^zf) people.' -^ Among the conspicuous divine forms of this jjeriod is the Queen of Serpents, whose verses are chanted over fire ; but she
is the earth, according to some passages (Ait. Br. v. 23 ; Cat.
Br. ii. I. 4. 30 ; iv. 6. 9. 17). In their divine origin there is,
indeed, according to the theology now current, no difference between the powers of light and of darkness, between the gods
and the ' spirits,' asuras, i.e., evil spirits. Many tales begin with the formula : ' The gods and evil spirits, both born of the Father-god' {Qat. Br. i. 2. 4. 8). Weber thinks that this implies close acquaintance with Persian worship, a sort of tit
for-tat ; for the Hindu would in that case call the holy spirit,
ahtira, of the Persian a devil, just as the Persian makes an
evil spirit, daeva, out of the Hindu god, deva. But the relations between Hindu and Persian in this period are still very
uncertain. It is interesting to follow out some of the Brahmanic legends, if only to see what was the conception of the evil spirits. In one such theological legend the gods and the
(evil) spirits, both being sons of the Father-god, inherited from him, respectively, mind and speech ; hence the gods got the sacrifice and heaven, while the evil spirits got this earth.
Again, the two entered on the inheritance of their father in time, and so the gods have the waxing moon, and the evil
spirits, the waning moon (Jb. iii. 2. i. 18 ; i. 7. 2. 22).
But what these Asuras or (evil) spirits really are may be
read easily from the texts. The gods are the spirits of light
;
the Asuras are the spirits of darkness. Therewith is indissolubly connected the idea that sin and darkness are of the same nature. So one reads that when the sun rises it frees
1 For the relations of the different castes at this period, see Weber, in the tenth volume of the Indische Stitdieii.



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 187
itself 'from darkness, from sin,' as a snake from its slough
{ii. ii. 3. I. 6). And in another passage it is said that darkness and illusion were given to the Asuras as their portion by the Father-god {ib. ii. 4. 2. 5). With this maybe compared also the frequent grouping of the Asuras or Rakshas with darkness
{e.g., ib. iii. 8. 2. 15 ; iv. 3. 4. 21). As to the nature of the gods the evidence is contradictory. Both gods and evil spirits were
originally soulless and mortal. Agni (Fire) alone was immortal, and it was only through him that the others continued to live. They became immortal by putting in their inmost being the holy (immortal) fire (ib. ii. 2. 2. 8). On the other hand, it is said that Agni was originally without brightness ; and Indra,
identified with the sun, was originally dark {ib. iv. 5. 4. 3 ; iii. 4.
2. 15). The belief in an originally human condition of the gods (even the Father-god was originally mortal) is exemplified
in a further passage, where it is said that the gods used to live on earth, but they grew tired of man's endless petitions and fled; also in another place, where it is stated that the gods used to drink together with men visibly, but now they
do so invisibly {ib. ii. 3. 4. 4; iii. 6. 2. 26). How did such gods obtain their supremacy ? The answer is simple, ' by sacrifice
'
{Qat. Br. iii. i. 4. 3 ; Ait. Br. ii. i. i). So now they live by 1
sacrifice : ' The sun would not rise if the priest did not make
j
sacrifice ' {Cat. Br. ii. 3. i. 5). Even the order of things would ' change if the order of ceremonial were varied : Night would
be eternal if the priests did so and so ; the months would not
|
pass, one following the other, if the priests walked out or j
entered together, etc. {ib. iv. 3. i. 9-10). It is by a knowledge
j
of the Vedas that one conquers all things, and the sacrifice '
is part and application of this knowledge, which in one passage i
is thus reconditely subdivided : ' Threefold is knowledge, the , Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, and the Sama Veda.^ The Rig i Veda, i.e., the verses sung, are the earth ; the Yajus is air ; the
1 The Atharvan is not yet recognized as a Veda.



188 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Samaii is the sky. He conquers earth, air, and sky respectively by these three Vedas. The Rik and Saman are Indra and are speech ; the Yajus is Vishnu and mind' {ib. iv. 6. 7. i ff.). An item follows that touches on a modern philosophical question. Apropos of speech and mind: 'Where speech (alone) existed everything was accomplished and known ; but where mind (alone) existed nothing was accomplished or known ' {ib. i. 4. 4. 3-4, 7). Mind and speech are male and female, and as yoke-fellows bear sacrifice to the gods; to be compared is the interesting dispute between mind and speech {ib. 5. 8). As dependent as is man on what is given by the gods, so dependent are the gods on what is offered to them by men
{Taitt. Br. ii. 2. 7. 3 ; Qat. Br. i. 2. 5. 24). Even the gods are now not native to heaven. They win heaven by sacrifice,
by metres, etc. {Qat. Br. iv. 3. 2. 5).
What, then, is the sacrifice '>. A means to enter into the
godhead of the gods, and even to control the gods ; a ceremony where every word was pregnant with consequences ;
^
every movement momentous. There are indications, however, that the priests themselves understood that much in the ceremonial was pure hocus-pocus, and not of such importance as
it was reputed to be. But such faint traces as survive of a freer spirit objecting to ceremonial absurdities only mark more
clearly the level plain of unintelligent superstition which was the feeding-ground of the ordinary priests. Some of the cases of revolted common-sense are worth
citing. Conspicuous as an authority on the sacrifice, and at the same time as a somewhat recalcitrant priest, is Yajnavalkya,
author and critic, one of the greatest names in Hindu ecclesiastical history. It was he who, apropos of the new rule in
1 And even the pronunciation of a word or the accent is fateful. The famous godly example of this is where Tvashtar, the artificer, in anger mispronounced indraQdtrtt as hidra^atru, whereby the meaning was changed from ' conqueror of Indra
'
to ' Indra-conquered,' with unexpected result {Qat. Br. i. 6. 3. 8 ; Taitt. S. ii. 4. 12. i).



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 189
ethics, SO strongly insisted upon after the Vedic age and al
ready beginning to obtain, the rule that no one should eat the flesh of the (sacred) cow (' Let no one eat beef. . . . Whoever eats it would be reborn (on earth) as a man of ill fame ') said
bluntly : 'As for me I eat (beef) if it is good (firm).'^ It cer
tainly required courage to say this, with the especial warning against beef, the meat of an animal peculiarly holy (^Qat. Br.
iii. I. 2. 2i). It was, again, Yajhavalkya {(Qat. Br. i. 3. i. 26), who protested against the priests' new demand that the benefit
of the sacrifice should accrue in part to the priest ; whereas
it had previously been understood that not the sacrificial priest
but the sacrificer (the worshipper, the man who hired the priest and paid the expenses) got all the benefit of the ceremony.
Against the priests' novel and unjustifiable claim Yajiiavalkya exclaims : ' How can people have faith in this ? Whatever be
the blessing for which the priests pray, this blessing is for the worshipper (sacrificer) alone.' ^ It was Yajhavalkya, too, who
rebutted some new superstition involving the sacrificer's wife,
with the sneer, 'who cares whether the wife,' etc. {kas tad adriyeta,-ib. 21). These protestations are naively recorded,
though it is once suggested that in some of his utterances Yajnavalkya was not in earnest (ib. iv. 2. i. 7). The high mind of this great priest is contrasted with the mundane views of his contemporaries in the prayers of himself and of another priest ; for it is recorded that whereas Yajnavalkya's prayer to
the Sun was 'give me light' (or 'glory,' varco me dehi), that of Aupoditeya was 'give me cows' (Jb. i. 9. 3. 16). The chronicler adds, after citing these prayers, that one obtains
1 The word is amsala^ strong, or ' from the shoulder ' (?). In iii. 4. 1. 2 one cooks an ox or a goat for a very distinguished guest, as a sort of guest-sacrifice. So the guest is called 'cow-killer' (Weber, Ved. Beitrdge, p. 36). 2 Compare ib. i. 9. i. 21, "let the priest not say 'guard me (or us),' but 'guard this worshipper (sacrificer),' for if he says 'me' he induces no blessing at all; the blessing is not for the priest, but for the sacrificer." In both passages, most emphatically, yajama7iasyaiva, ' for the sacrificer alone.'



190 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
whatever he prays for, either illumination or wealth.^ Yajna
valkya, however, is not the only protestant. In another pas
sage, ib. ii. 6. 3. 14-17, the sacrificer is told to shave his head
all around, so as to be like the sun ; this will ensure his being
able to 'consume (his foes) on all sides like the sun,' and it is added : But Asuri said, ' What on earth has it to do with
his head ? Let him not shave.' ^ ' Eternal holiness ' is won by him that offers the sacrifice of
the seasons. Characteristic is the explanation, 'for such an one wins the year, and a year is a complete whole, and a
complete whole is indestructible (eternal) ; hence his holiness is indestructible, and he thereby becomes a part of a year and goes to the gods ; but as there is no destruction in the gods,
his holiness is therefore indestructible' {ib. ii. 6. 3. i). Not only a man's self but also his Manes are benefited by means of sacrifice.^ He gives the Manes pleasure with his
offering, but he also raises their estate, and sends them up to live in a higher world.* The cosmological position of the
Manes are the avantaradifas, that is, between the four quarters; though, according to some, there are three kinds of them, somaManes, sacrifice-Manes (Manes of the sacrificial straw), and the burnt, i.e., the spirits of those that have been consumed in
fire. They are, again, identified with the seasons, and are expressly mentioned as the guardians of houses, so that the Brahmanic Manes are at once Penates, Lares, and Manes.^
1 Yam kdviain kdmayatc so ''smdi kdmah samrdhyate. 2 Asuri's name as i theologian is important, since the Sankhya philosophy is intimately connected with him ; if this Asuri be not another man with the same name (compare Weber, Lit. p. 152). 3 The regular sacrifices to the Manes are daily and monthly ; funerals and * faithfeasts,' ^rdddha, are occasional additions. 4 Each generation of Manes rises to a better (higher) state if the offerings continue. As a matter of ceremonial this means that the remoter generations of fathers are put indefinitely far off, while the immediate predecessors of a man are the real beneficiaries ; they climb up to the sky on the offering. 6 Compare ^at. Br. i. 8. i. 40 ; ii. 6. 1. 3, 7, 10, 42 ; ii. 4. 2. 24 ; v. 5. 4. 28,



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 191
The sacrifice is by no means meant as an aid to the acquire
ment of lieavenly bliss alone. Many of the great sacrifices are for the gaining of good things on earth. In one passage there is described a ceremony, the result of which is to be that the
warrior, who is the sacrificer, may say to a man of the people
"fetch out and give me your store " (ib. i. 3. 2. 15; iv. 3. 3. 10).
Everybody sacrifices, even the beasts erect altars and fires !
^
That one should sacrifice without the ulterior motive of gain is unknown. Brahmanic India knows no thank-offering. Ordinarily the gain is represented as a compensating gift from the
divinity, whom the sacrificer pleases with his sacrifice. Very
plainly is this expressed. " He offers the sacrifice to the god
with this text : ' Do thou give to me (and) I (will) give to thee ; do thou bestow on me (and) I (will) bestow on thee' " ( Vaj. S. iii. 50 ; Qat. Br. ii. 5. 3. 19). But other ends are accomplished.
By the sacrifice he may injure his enemy, but in offering it, if
he leaves too much over, that part accrues to the good of his
foe {Qat. Br. i. 2. i. 7; 9. i. 18). The sacrifice is throughout symbolical. The sacrificial straw represents the world ; the metre used represents all
living creatures, etc., — a symbolism frequently suggested by a mere pun, but often as ridiculously expounded with
out such aid. The altar's measure is the measure of metres. The cord of regeneration (badge of the twice-born,
the holy cord of the high castes) is triple, because food is
threefold, or because the father and mother with the child
make three {Cat. Br. iii. 5. i. 7 ff.; 2. i. 12); the jagati metre contains the living world, because this is called jagat
{ib. i. 8. 2. 11). Out of the varied mass of rules, speculations,- and fancies, a
few of general character may find place here, that the reader
1 This passage {ib. ii. i. ;;. 7) is preceded by a typical argument for setting up the fires under the Pleiades, the wives of the Great Bear stars. He may do or he may
not do so — the reasons contradict er.ch other, and all of them are incredibly silly.



192 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
may gain a collective impression of the religious literature of
the time. The fee for the sacrifice is mentioned in one place as one thousand cows. These must be presented in groups of three hundred and thirty-three each, three times, with an odd one of three colors. This is on account of the holy character of the numeral three. ' But Asuri (apparently fearful that this rule
would limit the fee) said " he may give more "
' {Qat. Br. iv. 5.
8. 14). As to the fee, the rules are precise and their pro
pounders are unblushing. The priest performs the sacrifice
for the fee alone, and it must consist of valuable garments,
kine, horses,^ or gold — when each is to be given is carefully stated. Gold is coveted most, for this is 'immortality,' 'the
seed of Agni,' and therefore peculiarly agreeable to the pious
priest.^ For his greed, which goes so far that he proclaims that he who gives a thousand kine obtains all things of heaven
(ib. iv. 5. I. 11), the priest has good precept to cite, for the
gods of heaven, in all the tales told of them, ever demand a reward from each other when they help their neighbor-gods. Nay, even the gods require a witness and a vow, lest they injure each other. Discord arose among them when once they performed the guest-offering; they divided into different parties, Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Varuna with the Adityas, and Indra with the Maruts. But with discord came weakness, and the evil spirits got the better of them. So they made a covenant with each other, and took Wind as witness that they would not deceive each other. This famous covenant of the gods is the prototype of that significant covenant made by the priest, that he would not, while pretending to beseech
1 This last tee is not so common. For an oblation to Siirya the fee is a white horse or -v white bull; either of them representing the proper form of the sun {C^at. Br. ii. 6. 3. 9) ; but another authority specifies twelve oxen and a. plough (Taitt. S. i. 8. 7).
^ Qat. Br. ii. i. j. 5 ; 2. 3. 28 ; iv, 3. 4. 14 ; 5. 1. 15 ; four kinds of fees, ib. iv. 3. 4.6, 7, 24 ff. (Milk is also ' Agni's seed,' ib. ii. 2. 4. 15).



BKAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 193
good for the' sacrificer,^ secretly do him harm (as he could by altering the ceremonial).^ The theory of the fee, in so far as
it affects the sacrifices, is that the gods, the Manes, and men
all exist by what is sacrificed. Even the gods seek rew-ards ;
hence the priests do the same.^ The sacrificer sacrifices to get
a place in devaloka (the world of the gods). The sacrifice goes up to the world of gods, and after it goes the fee which the
sacrificer (the patron) gives ; the sacrificer follows by catching
hold of the fee given to the priests {ib. i. 9. 3. 1). It is to be
noted, moreover, that sacrificing for a fee is recognized as a ( profession. The work (sacrifice is work, 'work is sacrifice,' it is somewhere said) is regarded as a matter of business. There
are three means of livelihood occasionally referred to, telling
stories, singing songs, and reciting the Veda at a sacrifice
(J^at. Br. iii. 2. 4. i6). As an example of the absurdities given as ' the ways of knowledge ' (absurdities which are necessary to "know in order to a full understanding of the mental state under consideration)
may be cited Qat. Br. iv. 5. 8. 11, where it is said that if the
sacrificial cow goes east the sacrificer wins a good world here
after ; if north, he becomes more glorious on earth ; if west,
rich in people and crops; if south, he dies; 'such are the ways of knowledge.' In the same spfrit it is said that the sun
rises east because the priest repeats certain verses {Ait. Br. i.
7. 4). No little stress is laid on geographical position. The
east is the quarter of the gods ; the north, of men ; the south, of the dead (Manes; Qat. Br. i. 2. 5. 17); while the west is
the region of snakes, according to ib. iii. i. i. 7. On account of the godly nature of the east ("from the east came the gods

westward to men," ib. ii. 6. i. ii) the sacrificial building, like
occidental churches, is built east and west, not north and
south. The cardinal points are elsewhere given to certain
gods ;- thus the north is Rudra's.' It has been said that the theological ideas are not clear. This was inevitable, owing to the tendency to identify various
divinities. Especially noticeable is the identification of new or
local gods with others better accredited, Rudra and Agni, etc. Rudra is the god of cattle, and when the other gods went to heaven by means of sacrifice he remained on earth; his local
names are Qarva, Bhava, ' Beast-lord,' Rudra, Agni {Qat. Br. i.
7. 3. 8; Mait. S. i. 6. 6). Indra is the Vasu of the gods. The
gods are occasionally thirty-four in number, eight Vasus, eleven
Rudras, twelve Adityas, heaven and earth, and Prajapati as the thirty-fourth ; but this Prajapati is the All and Everything
{Qat. Br. i. 6. 4. 2 ; iv. 5. 7. 2 £E.). Of these gods, who at first
were all alike -and good, three became superior, Agni, Indra,
and Surya. But, again, the Sun is death, and Agni is head of all the gods. Moreover, the Sun is now Indra; the Manes are the seasons, and Varuna, too, is the seasons, as being the
year {Qat. Br. iv. 5. 4. i ; i. 6. 4. 18 ; iv. 4. 5. 18). Aditi, as we have said, is the Earth ; the fee for an offering to her is a cow. Why ? Because Earth is a cow and Aditi is Earth
;
Earth is a mother and a cow is a mother. Hence the fee
is a cow.^ The tales of the gods, for the most part, are foolish. But
they show well what conception the priests had of their divini
1 lb. ii. 6. 2. 5. Here Rudra (compare (J!iva and Hekate of the cross-roads) is said
to go upon ' cross-roads ' ; so that his sacrifice is on cross-roads — one of the new teachings since the time of the Rig Veda. Rudra's sister, Ambilca, ib. 9, is another new creation, the genius of autumnal sicliness. 2 <^at. Br. \\. .1.. I. 21. How much non-serious fancy there may lie here it is difficult to determine. It seems impossible that such as follows can have been meant in earnest : " Tlie sacrifice, prayaja, is victory, Jaya, because yaja =jaya. With this knowledge one gets the victory over his rivals" {ib. i. 5. 3. 3, 10).



BRAHMANIC THEOLOGY AND THE SACRIFICE. 195
ties. Man's original skin was put by the gods upon the cow; hence a cow runs away from a man because she thinks lie is trying to get back his skin. The gods cluster about at an oblation, each crying out ' My name,' i.e., each is anxious to
get it. The gods, with the evil spirits — ' both sons of the
Father' — attract to themselves the plants; Varuna gets the barley by a pun. They build castles to defend themselves from the evil spirits. Five gods are picked out as worthy of offerings: Aditi, Speech, Agni, Soma, the Sun (five, because
the seasons are five and the regions are five). Indra and Wind have a dispute of possession; Prajapati, the Father, decides it.
The heavenly singers, called the Gandharvas, recited the Veda to entice (the divine female) Speech to come to them ; while the gods, for the same purpose, created the lute, and sang and played to her. She came to the gods; hence the weakness of women in regard to such things. Indra is the god of sacrifice;
the stake of the sacrifice is Vishnu's; Vayu (Wind) is the
leader of beasts ; Bhaga is blind ;
' Pushan (because he eats
mush) is toothless. The gods run a race to see who shall get first to the sacrifice, and Indra and Agni win ; they are the warrior-caste among the gods, and the All-gods are the people {vi^ve, vi(.). Yet, again, the Maruts are the people, and Varuna
is the warrior-caste; and, again. Soma is the warrior-caste. The Father-god first created birds, then reptiles and snakes. As these all died he created mammalia; these survived because they had food in themselves; hence the Vedic poet says 'three
generations have passed away.' ^

Varuna is now quite the god of night and god of purification, as a water-god. Water is the ' essence (sap) of immortality,'
and the bath of purification at the end of the sacrifice {ava
bhrtha) stands in direct relation to Varuna. The formula to be repeated is: "With the gods' help may I wash out sin against the gods ; with the help of men the sin against men "
(yQat. Br. iv. 4. 3. 15; ii. 5. 2. 47). Mitra and Varuna are,
respectively, intelligence and will, priest and warrior ; and while the former may exist without the latter, the latter cannot live without the former, ' but they are perfect only when they
cooperate ' {ib. iv. i. 4. i).
Of the divine legends some are old, some new. One speaks of the sacrifice as having been at first human, subsequently
changing to beast sacrifice, eventually to a rice offering,
which last now represents the original sacrificial animal, man.^ Famous, too, is the legend of the flood and Father Manu's escape from it lyQat. Br. i. 8. i. i ff.). Again, the Vedic myth
is retold, recounting the rape of sqma by the metrical equiva
lent of fire {Taitt. Br. i. i. 3. 10; Qat. Br. i. 8. 2. 10). Another tale takes up anew the old story of Cupid and Psyche (Pururavas and Urvagi) ; and another that of the Hindu Prometheus story, wherein Matarigvan fetches fire from heaven,
and gives it to mortals (Tditt. Br. iii. 2. 3. 2 ; Qat. Br. xi. 5. i.
i; i. 7. I. 11).'
Interesting, also, is the tale of Vishnu having been a dwarf,
and the tortoise avatar, not of Vishnu, but of Prajapati ; also the attempt of the evil spirits to climb to heaven, and the trick with which Indra outwitted them.^ For it is noticeable that
priest, as, in the Rig Veda, x. 141. 3, Brihaspati is the ' Brahma of gods.' Tlie next (Brahmanic) step is deified brahma; the personal Brahma as god, called also Fathergod (Prajapati) or simply The Father {pita). 1 Compare Mdit. S. iii. 10. 2 ; Ait. Br. ii. S ; ^at. Br. i. :i. 3, 5 ; vi. 2. i. 39; 3. i. 24 ; ii. V 2. 16, a ram and ewe ' made of barley.'

the evil spirits are as strong by nature as are the gods, and it is only by craft that the latter prevail.^
Seldom are the tales of the gods indecent. The story of Prajapati's incest with his daughter is a remnant of nature worship which survives, in more or less anthropomorphic form,
from the time of the Rig Veda (x. 6i.) to that of mediaeval
literature,^ and is found in full in the epic, as in the Brahmanic period ; but the story always ends with the horror of the gods
at the act.^
Old legends are varied. The victory over Vritra is now
expounded thus : Indra, who slays Vritra, is the sun. Vritra
is the moon, who swims into the sun's mouth on the night of the new moon. The sun rises after swallowing him, and the moon is invisible because he is swallowed (" he who knows this swallows his foes "). The sun vomits out the moon, and
the latter is then seen in the west, and increases again, to
serve the sun as food. In another passage it is said that when
the moon is invisible he is hiding in plants and waters l^Qat.
Br. i. 6. 3. 17; 4. 18-20).

When the sacrifice is completed the priest returns, as it were, to earth, and becomes human. He formally puts off his sacrificial vow, and rehabilitates himself with humanity, saying, "I am even he that I am."* As such a man, through service to the gods become a divine offering, and no longer human, was
doubtless considered the creature that first served as the

sacrificial animal. Despite protestant legends such as that just
recoTded, despite formal disclaimers, human sacrifice existed
long after the period of the Rig Veda, where it is alluded to ; a period when even old men are exposed to die.^ The anaddhdpurusha is not a fiction ; for that, on certain occasions,
instead of this 'man of straw' a real victim was offered, is shown by the ritual manuals and by Brahmanic texts. ^ Thus,
in Qat. Br. vi. 2. i. 18: "He kills a man first. . . . The cord
that holds the man is the longest." It is noteworthy that also among the American Indians the death of a human victim by
fire was regarded as a religious ceremony, and that, just as in
India the man to be sacrificed was allowed almost all his
desires for a year, so the victim of the Indian was first greeted as brother and presented with gifts, even with a wife.''
But this, the terrible barbaric side of religious worship, is
now distinctly yielding to a more humane religion. The 'barley ewe ' * is taking the place of a bloodier offering. It has been urged that the humanity" and the accompanying silliness of the Brahmanic period as compared with the more robust character of the earlier age are due to the weakening and softening
effects of the climate. But we doubt whether the climate of the Punjab differs as much from that of Delhi and Patna as does the character of the Rig Veda from that of the Brahmanas.
We shall protest again when we come to the subject of
1 RV. viii. 51. 2 ; .Zimmer, loc. cit. p. 328. 2 Compare Weber, Episch. in Vedisch. Ritual, p. 777 (and above). The man who is slaughtered must be neither a priest nor a slave, but a warrior or a man of the third caste (Weber, loc. cit. above). 8Zc Mercier, 1637, ap. Parkman, loc. cit. p. 80. The current notion that the American Indian burns his victims at the stake merely for pleasure is not incorrect. He frequently did so, as he does so to-day, but in the seventeenth century this act often is part of a religious ceremony. He probably would have burned his captive, anyway, but he gladly utilized his pleasure as a means of propitiating his gods. In India it was just the other way. . * Substitutes of metal or of earthen victims are also mentioned. 5 That the Vedic rite of killing the sacrificial beast (by beating and smothering) was very cruel may be seen in the description.

Buddhism against the too great influence whicli has been claimed for climate. Politics and society, in our opinion, had
more to do with altering the religions of India than had a higher temperature and miasma. As a result of ease and sloth

for the Brahmans are now the divine pampered servants of. established kings, not the energetic peers of a changing popu
lation of warriors — the priests had lost the inspiration that came from action ; they now made no new hymns ; they only formulated new rules of sacrifice. They became intellectually
debauched and altogether weakened in character. Synchronous with this universal degradation and lack of fibre, is found
the occasional substitution of barley and rice sacrifices for
those of blood ; and it may be that a sort of selfish charity was at work here, and the priest saved the beast to spare himself. But there is no very early evidence of a humane view of sacrifice influencing the priests.
The Brahman is no Jain. One must read far to hear a note of the approaching ahimsd doctrine of 'non-injury.' At most
one finds a contemptuous allusion, as in a pitying strain, to the poor plants and animals that follow after man in reaping some sacrificial benefit from a ceremony.^ It does not seem to us that a recognized respect for animal life or kindness to dumb creatures lies at the root of proxy sacrifice, though it doubtless
came in play. But still less does it appear probable that, as is
often said, aversion to beast-sacrifice is due to the doctrine of karma, and re-birth in animal form. The karma notion begins to appear in the Brahmanas, but not in the samsdra shape of transmigration. It was surely not because the Hindu was afraid of eating his deceased grandmother that he first abstained from meat. For, long after the doctrine of karma and samsdra'^
is established, animal sacrifices are not only permitted but
1 Cat. Br. i. 5. 2. 4. 2 Samsdra is transmigration; karma, 'act,' implies that the change of abode is' conditioned by the acts of a former life. Each may exclude the other ; but in common parlance each implies the other.



200 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
enjoined ; and the epic characters shoot deer and even eat cows. We think, in short, that the change began as a sump
tuary measure only. In the case of human sacrifice there is
doubtless a civilized repugnance to the act, which is clearly seen in many passages where the slaughter of man is made purely symbolical. The only wonder is that it should have
obtained so long after the age of the Rig Veda. But like the stone knife of sacrifice among the Romans it is received custom, and hard to do away with, for priests are conservative. Human
sacrifice must have been peculiarly horrible from the fact that
the sacrificer not only had to kill the man but to eat him, as is
attested by the formal statement of the liturgical works.-' But
in the case of other animals (there are five sacrificial animals, of which man is first) we think it was a question of expense on the part of the laity. When the soma became rare and expensive, substitutes were permitted and enjoined. So with the
great sacrifices. The priests had built up a great complex of forms, where at every turn fees were demanded. The whole expense, falling on the one individual to whose benefit accrued the sacrifice, must have been enormous ; in the case of ordinary people impossible. But the priests then permitted the sacrifice
of substitutes, for their fees still remained; and even in the case of hunian sacrifice some such caution may have worked, for ordinarily it cost 'one thousand cattle ' to buy a man to be
sacrificed. A proof of this lies in the fact that animal sacrifices were not forbidden at any time, only smaller (cheaper) animals took the place of cattle. In the completed Brahmanic code the rule is that animals ought not to be killed except at sacrifice,
and practically the smaller creatures were substituted for cattle, just as the latter had gradually taken the place of the old horse
(and man) sacrifice.
If advancing civilization results in an agreeable change of morality in many regards, it is yet accompanied with wretched
1 Weber, Indische Streifen^ i. p. 72.



BRAHMANIC RELIGION. 201
traits in others. The whole silHness of superstition exceeds behef. Because Bhallabheya once broke his arm on changing the metre of certain formulae, it is evident to the priest that it
is wrong to trifle with received metres, and hence "let no one do this hereafter." There is a compensation on reading such trash in the thought that all this superstition has kept for us
a carefully preserved text, but that is an accident of priestly
fooHshness, and the priest can be credited only with the folly. Why is ' horse-grass ' used in the sacrifice ? Because the sacrifice once ran away and "became a horse." Again one is
thankful for the historical side-light on the horse-sacrifice ; but the witlessness of the unconscious liistorian can but bring
him into contempt.^ Charms that are said against one are of course cast out by other charms. If one is not prosperous
with one name he takes another. If the cart creaks at the
sacrifice it is the voice of evil spirits ; and a formula must
avert the omen. »S(7»za-husks are liable to turn into snakes ; a formula must avert this catastrophe. Everything done at the sacrifice is godly ; ergo, everything human is to be done
in an inhuman manner, and, since in human practice one cuts
his left finger-nails first and combs the left side of the bea:rd
first, at the sacrifice he must cut nails and beard first on the
other side, for " whatever is human at a sacrifice is useless
"
{T.)yrddhain vai tad yajnasya yad mdnusani). Of religious puns we have given instances already. Agni says: "prop me on the propper for that is proper " (Jiita), etc., etc.^ One of these examples of depraved superstition is of a more dangerous
nature. The effect of the sacrifice is covert as well as overt.

The change of name is interesting. There is a remark in another part of tlie same work to tlie effect that when a man prospers in life they give his name also to his son, grandson, and to his father and grandfather (vi. I. 2. 13). On the other hand, it was the custom of the Indian kings in later ages to assume the names of their prosperous grandfathers (JRAS. iv. 85).



202 ' THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The word is as potent as the act. Consequently if the sacrificer during the sacrifice merely mutter the words " let such an one
die," he must die; for the sacrifice is holy, godly; the words
are divine, and cannot be frustrated (Cat. JBr. iii. i. 4. i ;
iv. I. I. 26).
All this superstition would be pardonable if it were primitive.
But that it comes long after the Vedic poets have- sung reveals a continuance of stupidity which is marvellous. Doubtless
those same poets were just as superstitious, but one would think that with all the great literature behind them, and the thoughts of the philosophers just rising among them, these later
priests might show a higher level of intelligence. But in this regard they are to India what were the monks of mediaeval times to Europe.
We turn now to the ethical side of religion. But, before leaving the sacrifice, one point should be explained clearly. The Hindu sacrifice can be performed only by the priest, and he must be of the highest caste. No other might or could perform it. For he alone understood the ancient texts, which to the laity were already only half intelligible. Again, as Earth has pointed out, the Hindu sacrifice is performed only for one individual or his family. It was an expensive rite (for the gaining of one object), addressed to many gods for the benefit of one man. To offset this, however, one must remember that
there were popular fetes and sacrifices of a more general nature, to which many were invited and in which even the lower castes took part ; and these were also of remote antiquity. Already current in the Brahmanas is the phrase 'man's debts.' Either three or four of such moral obligations were recognized, debts to the_gods, to the seers, to the Manes, and
to men. Whoever pays these debts, it is said, has discharged allTiis duties, and by him all is obtained, all is won. And what are these. duties ? To the gods he owes sacrifices; to the seers, study of the Vedas ; to the Manes, offspring ; to man,



BRAHMANIC RELIGION. 203
hospitality (Cat. Br. i. 7. 2. i ff. ; in Taitt. Br. vi. 3. 10. 5, the
last fails). Translated into modern equivalents this means that man must have faith and good works. But more really is demanded than is stated here. First and foremost is, the duty of truthfulness. Agni is the lord of vows among the gods
(RV. viii. II. I ; (^at. Br. iii. 2. 2. 24), and speech is a divinity
(Sarasvati is personified speech, Qat. Br. iii. i. 4. 9, etc.).
Truth is a religious as well as moral duty. "This (All) is
two-fold, there is no third ; all is either truth or untruth ; now
truth alone is the gods {satyam eva devas) and untruth is man.'' ^ Moreover, "one law the gods observe, truth" {f^at. Br. i. i. i.
4; iii. 3. 2. 2 ; 4. 2. 8). There is another passa-ge upon this subject : " To serve the sacred fire means truth ; he who speaks truth feeds the fire ; he who speaks lies pours water on it ; in
the one case he strengthens his vital (spiritual) energy, and becomes better ; in the other he weakens it and becomes worse" {lb. ii. 2. 2. 19). The second sin, expressly named
and reprobated as such, is adultery. This is a sin against Varuna.^ In connection with this there is an interesting
passage implying a priestly confessional. At the sacrifice the sacrificer's wife is formally asked by the priest whether
she is faithful to her husband. She is asked this that she
may not sacrifice with' guilt on her soul, for "when confessed
the guilt becomes less." " If it is asked what other moral virtues
are especially inculcated besides truth and purity, the answer is that the acts commonly cited as self-evidently sins are murder,
theft, and abortion ; incidentally, gluttony, anger, and procras
1 Were it not for the first clause it would be more natural to render the original ' The gods are. truth alone, and men are untruth.' 2 In Qat. Br. ii, 4. 2. 5-6 it is said that the Father-god gives certain rules of eating to gods, Manes, men, and beasts : " Neither gods, Manes, nor beasts transgress the Father's law, only some men do." 8 (^.at. Br. ii. 5. 2. 20. Varuna seizes on her paramour, when she Confesses.- Taitt. Br. i. 6. 5. i. The guilt confessed becomes less "because it thereby becomes truth" (right).



204 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
tination.^ As to the moral virtue of observing days, certain
times are allowed and certain times are not allowed for worldly acts. But every day is in part a holy-day to the Hindu. The
list of virtues is about the same, therefore, as that of the deca
logue — the worship of the right divinity; the observance of
certain seasons for prayer and sacrifice ; honor to the parents ;
abstinence from theft, murder, adultery. Envy alone is omitted.^ What eschatological conceptions are strewn through the literature of this era are vague and often contradictory. The
souls of the departed are at one time spoken of as the stars
{Taitt. S. V. 4. I. 3) ; at another, as uniting with gods and
living in the world of the gods {(^at. Br. ii. 6. 4. 8). The principle of karma, if not the theory, is already known, but the very thing that the completed' philosopher abhors is
looked upon as a blessing, viz., rebirth, body and all, even on earth.^ Thus in one passage, as a reward for knowing some divine mystery (as often happens, this mystery is of little importance, only that ' spring is born again out of winter '), the savant is to be 'born again in this world ' (^pimar ha va 'asmin
lake bhavati, Qat. Br. i. 5. 3. 14). The esoteric wisdom is here the transfer of the doctrine of metempsychosis to spring. Man has no hope of immortal life (on earth) ; ^ but, by estab
1 See Qat. Br. ii. 4. z. 6; 4. i. 14; i. 3. 9; 3. i. 28: "Who knows man's morrow? Then let one not procrastinate." " Today is self, this alone is certain, uncertain is the morrow." 2 Some little rules are interesting. The Pythagorean abstinence from masas, beans, for instance, is enjoined; though this rule is opposed by Barku Varshna, Qat. Br. i. 1. i. 10, on the ground that no offering to the gods is made of beans; " hence he said ' cook beans for me.'
"
3 Animals may represent gods. " The bull is a form of Indra," and so if the bull can be made to roar {Qat. Br. ii. 5. 3. iS), then one may know that Indra is come to the sacrifice. " Man is born into (whatever) world is made (by his acts in a previous existence)," is a short formula (Qat. Br. vi. ij. 2. 27), which represents the karma doctrine in its essential principle, though the ' world ' is here not this world, but the next. Compare Weber, ZDMG. ix. 237 ff. ; Muir, OST. v. 314 ff. * Though youth may be restored to him by the Ajvins, Qat. Br. iv. i. 5. i ff. Here the Horsemen are identified with Heaven and Earth (16).

lishing the holy fires, and especially by establishing in his inmost soul the immortal element of fire, he lives the full
desirable length of life (ib. ii. 2. 2. 14. To the later sage,
length of life is undesirable). But in yonder world, where the
sun itself is death, the soul dies again and again. All those
on the other side of the sun, the gods, are immortal ; but all
those on this side are exposed to this death. When the sun wishes, he draws out the vitality of any one, and then that one dies ; not once, but, being drawn up by the sun, which is death, into the very realm of death (how different to the conception of the sun in the Rig Veda !) he dies over and over again. ^ But in another passage it is said that when the sacrificer is consecrated he ' becomes one of the deities ' ; and one even finds the doctrine that one obtains ' union with Brahma,' which is quite in the strain of the Upanishads ; but here such a saying can refer only to the upper castes, for " the
gods talk only to the upper castes " (^Qat. Br. xi. 4. 4. i ; iii. I. I. 8-10). The dead man is elsewhere represented as going to heaven ' with his whole body,' and, according to one passage, when he gets to the next world his good and evil are weighed in a balance. There are, then, quite diverse views in regard
to the fate of a man after death, and not less various are the opinions in regard to his reward and punishment. According to the common belief the dead, on leaving this world, pass
betv/een two fires, agnigikhe, raging on either side of his path. These fires burn the one that ought to be burned (the wicked), ' and let the good pass by. Then the spirit (or the man him
1 Cat, Br. ii. 3, 3. 7. Apropos of the Brahmanic sun it may be mentioned that, according to Ait. Br. iii. 44, the sun never really sets. " People think that he sets, but in truth he only turns round after reaching the end of the day, and makes night below, day above ; and when they think he rises in the morning, he, having come to the end of the night, turns round, and makes day below, night above. He never really sets. Whoever knows this of him, that he never sets, obtains union and likeness of form with the sun, and the same abode as the sun's." Compare Muir, OST. v. 321. This may be the real reason why the Rig Veda speaks of a dark and
light sun.



206 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
self in body) is represented as going up on one of two paths. Either he goes to the Manes on a path which, according to later teaching, passes southeast through the moon, or he goes
northeast (the gods' direction) to the sun, which is his ' course and stay.' In the same chapter one is informed that the rays of the sun are the good (dead), and that every brightest light is the Father-god. The general conception here is that the
sun or the stars are the destination of the pious. On the other hand it is said that one will enjoy the fruit of his acts here on
earth, in a new birth ; or that he will ' go to the next world '
;
or that he will suffer for his sins in hell. The last is told in legendary form, and appears to us to be not an early view retained in folk-lore, but a late modification of an old legend. Varuna sends his son Bhrigu to hell to find out what happens
after death, and he finds people suffering torture, and, again, avenging themselves on those that have wronged them. But, despite the resemblance between this and Grecian myth, the fact that in the whole compass of the RiK (in the Atharvan perhaps in v. 19) there is not the slightest allusion to torture
in hell, precludes, to our mind, the possibility of this phase having been an ancient inherited belief.' Annihilation or a life in under darkness is the first (Rik)
hell. The general antithesis of light (as good) and darkness (as bad) is here plainly revealed again. Sometimes a little
variation occurs. Thus, according to Qat. Br. vi. 5. 4. 8, the
stars are women-souls, perhaps, as elsewhere, men also. The
< 'k1 (^at. Br. i. 4. 3. 11-22 ('The sinner shall suffer and go quickly to yonder world ') ; xi. 6. I (compare Weber, loc. cit. p. 20 ff. ; ZDMG. ix. 237), the Bhrigu story, of which a more modern form is found in the Upanishad period. For tlie course of the sun, the fires on either side of the way, the departure to heaven ' with the whole body,' compare (^at. Br. i. 9. 3. 2-15 ; iv. 5. 1. 1 ; vi. 6. 2. 4 ; xi. z. 7. 33 ; Weber, /tJr. t7Y. ; jMuir, loc. cit. v. p. 314. Not to have all one's bones in the next world is a disgrace, as Muir says, and for that reason they are collected at burial. Compare tlie custom as described by the French missionaries here. The American Indian has to have all his bones for future use, and the burying of the skeleton is an annual religious 'ceremony.



BRAHMANIC THEORIES OF CREATION. 201
converse notion that darkness is the abode of evil appears at a very early date : " Indra brought down the heathen, dasyiis,
into the lowest darkness," it is said in the Atharva Veda
(ix. 2. 17).^
In the later part of the great ' Brahmana of the hundred paths ' there seems to be a more modern view inculcated in
regard to the fate of the dead. Thus, in vi. i. 2. 36, the
opinion of ' some,' that the fire on the altar is to bear the worshipper to the sky, is objected to, and it is explained that he becomes immortal ; which antithesis is in purely Upanishadic style, as will be seen below.
BRAHMANIC THEORIES OF CREATION.
In Vedic polytheism, with its strain of pantheism, the act of
creating the world ^ is variously attributed to different gods. At the end of this period theosophy invented the god of the golden germ, the great Person (known also by other titles), who is the one (pantheistic) god, in whom all things are contained, and who himself is contained in even the smallest thing. The Atharvan transfers the same idea in its delinea
tion of the pantheistic image to Varuna, that Varuna who is the seas and yet is contained "in the drop of water" (iv. 16), a Varuna as different to the Varuna of the Rik as is the
1 Compare RV. iv. 28. 4 ; ' Thou Indra madest lowest the heathen.' Weber has shown, loc. cit., that the general notion of the Brahmanas is that all are born again in the next world, where they are rewarded or punished according as they are good or bad ; whereas in the Rig Veda the good rejoice in heaven, and the bad are annihilated. This general view is to be modified, however, by such side-theories as those just mentioned, that the good (or wise) may be reborn on earth, or be united with gods, or become sunUght or stars (the latter are ' watery ' to the Hindu, and this may explain the statement that the soul is 'in the midst of waters'). 2 There is in this age no notion of the repeated creations found in later literature. On the contrary, it is expressly said in the Rig \'eda, vi. 48. 22, that heaven and earth are created but once : " Only once was heaven created, only once was earth creslted," Zimmer, AIL. 408.



208 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Atharvan Indra to his older prototype. Philosophically the
Rik, at its close, declares that "desire is the seed of mind," and that " being arises from not-being." In the Brahmanas the creator is the All-god in more anthropo
morphic form. The Father^god, Prajapati, or Brahma (personal equivalent of brahma) is not only the father of gods, men, and devils, but he is the All. This Father-god of universal sovereignty, Brahma, remains to the end the personal creator. It is he who will serve as creator for the Puranic
Sankhya philosophy, and even after the rise of the Hindu sects he will still be regarded in this light, although his activity
will be conditioned by the will of Vishnu or Civa. In pure philosophy there will be an abstract First Cause ; but as there
is no religion in the acknowledgment of a First Cause, this too will soon be anthropomorphized. The Brahmanas themselves present no clear picture of creation. All the accounts of a personal creator are based merely
on anthropomorphized versions of the text 'desire is the seed.' Prajapati wishes offspring, and creates. There is, on the other hand, a philosophy of creation which reverts to the tale of the 'golden germ.'^ The world was at first water; thereon
floated a cosmic golden egg (the principle of fire). Out of
this came Spirit that desired ; and by desire he begat the worlds and all things. It is improbable that in this somewhat Orphic mystery there lies any pre-Vedic myth. The notion comes up first in the golden germ and egg-born bird (sun) of the Rik. It is not specially Aryan, and is found even among the American Indians.^ It is this Spirit with which the Fathergod is identified. But guess-work philosophy then asks what
1 When the principle of life is explained it is in terms of sun or fire. Thus Prajapati, Lord of beings, or Father-god, is first an epithet of Savitar, RV. iv. 53. 2 ; and the golden germ must be fire. 2 Schoolcraft, Historical and Statistical Information^ i. 32. As examples, of the many passages where 'water is the beginning' may be cited f^at. Br, vi. 7. i. 17; xl. 1. 6. I. The sun, born as Aditi's eighth son, is the bird, 'egg-born,' RV. x. 72. '8.

upheld this god, and answers that a support upheld all things. So Support becomes a god in his turn, and, since he must reach through time and space, this Support, Skambha, becomes
the All-god also ; and to him as to a great divinity the Atharvan
sings some of its wildest strains. When once speculation is
set going in the Brahmanas, the result of its travel js to land
its followers in intellectual chaos. ^ The gods create the Father^ god in one passage, and in another the Father-god creates the gods. The Father creates the waters, whence rises the golden egg. But, again, the waters create the egg, and out of the egg is
born the Father. A farrago of contradictions is all that these tales amount to, nor are they redeemed even by a poetical garb.^ In the period immediately following the Brahmanas, or toward the end of the Brahmanic period, as one will, there is a famous distinction made between the gods. Some gods, it is said, are spirit-god s ; some are work-gods. They are born of
spirit and of works, respectively. The difference, however, is not essential, but functional ; so that one may conclude from
this authority, the Nirukta (a grammatical and epexigetical work), that all the gods have a like nature ; and that the spirit
gods, who are the older, differ only in lack of specific functions from the work-gods. A not uninteresting debate follows this passage in regard to the true nature of the gods. Some people say they are anthropomorphic ; others deny this. " And certainly what is seen of the gods is not anthropomorphic ; for example, the sun, the earth, etc."^ In such a period of theo
logical advance it is matter of indifference to which of a group
of gods, all essentially one, is laid the task of creation. And,
indeed, from the Vedic period until the completed systems of philosophy, all creation to the philosopher is but emanation ; and stories of specific acts of creation are not regarded by him
i Among the new creators of Atharvan origin are, for instance, the sun under the name of Rohita, Desire (Love), etc., etc. - Ilhistrations of these contradictions may be found in plenty apud Muir iv. p. 20 ff. 3 Nirukta, vii. 4 j Muir, loc. cit. p. 131 and v. 17.



210 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
as detracting from the creative faculty of the First Cause. The
actual creator is for him the factor and agent of the real god. On the other hand, the vulgar worshipper of every era believed
only in reproduction on the part of an anthropomorphic god ;
and that god's own origin he satisfactorily explained by the myth of the golden egg. The view depended in each case not on the age but on the man.
If in these many pages devoted to the Brahmanas we have
produced the impression that the religious literature of this period is a confused jumble, where unite descriptions of ceremonies, formulae, mysticism, superstitions, and all the output
of active bigotry ; an olla podrida which contains, indeed, odds and ends of sound morality, while it presents, on the whole, a
sad view of the latter-day saints, who devoted their lives to
making it what it is ; we have offered a fairly correct view of
the age and its priests, and the rather dreary series of illustra
tions will not have been collected in vain. We have given,
however, no notion at all of the chief object of this class of
writings, the liturgical details of the sacrifices themselves. Even a rdsmnd of one comparatively short ceremony would be so long and tedious that the explication of the intricate formali
ties would scarcely be a sufficient reward. With Hillebrandt's patient analysis of the New- and Full-Moon sacrifice,' of which a sketch is given by von Schroeder in his Literatur und Cultur, the curious reader will be able to satisfy himself that a minute description of these ceremonies would do little to further his knowledge of the religion, when once he grasps the fact that the sacrifice is but show. Symbolism without folk-lore, only with the imbecile imaginings of a daft mysticism, is the soul of
it; and its outer form is a certain number of formulae, mechanical movements, oblations, and slaughterings.

THE SACRIFICE OF DOGSTAIL. 211
But we ought not to close the account of the era without giving counter-illustrations of the legendary aspect of this religion ; for which purpose we select two of the best-known tales, one from the end of the Brahmana that is called the Aitareya; the other from the beginning of the Qatapatha
;
the former in abstract, the latter in full.
THE SACRIFICE OF DOGSTAIL {Ait. Br. vii. 13).
Harigcandra, a king born in the great race of Ikshvaku, had
no son. A sage told him what blessings are his who has a son : ' He that has no son has no place in the world ; in the
person of a son a man is reborn, a second self is begotten.'
Then the king desired a son, and the sage instructed him to
pray to Varuna for one, and to offer to sacrifice him to the god. This he did, and a son, Rohita, at last was born to him. God Varuna demanded the sacrifice. But the king said : ' He is not
fit to be sacrificed, so young as he is ; wait till he is ten days old.' The god waited ten days, and demanded the sacrifice. But the king said : ' Wait till his teeth come.' The god waited, and then demanded the sacrifice. But the king said : ' Wait till his teeth fall out ' ; and when the god had waited, and
again demanded the sacrifice, the father said : ' Wait till his new teeth come.' But, when his teeth were come and he was demanded, the father said : ' A warrior is not fit to be sacrificed
till he has received his armor' (i.e., until he is knighted). So the god waited till the boy had received his armor, and then he demanded the sacrifice. Thereupon, the king called his
son, and said unto him : ' I will sacrifice thee to the god who
gave thee to me.' But the son said, ' No, no,' and took his bow and fled into the desert. Then Varuna caused the king
to be afflicted with dropsy.^ When Rohita heard of this he
1 The water-sickness already imputed to this god in the Rig Veda. This tale and that of Bhrigu (referred to above) show an ancient trait in the position of Varuna, as
chief god.



212 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
was about to return, but Indra, disguised as a priest, met him, and said : ' Wander on, for the foot of a wanderer is hke a
flower ; his spirit grows, and reaps fruit, and all his sins are forgiven in the fatigue of wandering.' ^ So Rohita, thinking that a priest had commanded him, wandered ; and every year, as he would return, Indra met him, and told him still to wander. Oh one of these occasions Indra inspires him to continue on his journey by telling him that the hita was now auspicious ; using the names of dice afterwards applied to the four ages.*
Finally, after six years, Rohita resolved to purchase a substi
tute for sacrifice. He meets a starving seer, and offers to buy
one of his sons (to serve as sacrifice), the price to be one hundred cows. The seer has three sons, and agrees to the bargain ; but "the father said, ' Do not take the oldest,' and the mother said, 'Do not take the youngest,' so Rohita took the middle
son, Dogstail." Varuna immediately agrees to this substitu
tion of Dogstail for Rohita, " since a priest is of more value
than a warrior."
The sacrifice is made ready, and Vigvamitra (the Vedic seer)
is the officiating priest. But no one would bind the boy to the post. ' If thou wilt give me another hundred cows I will bind him,' says the father of Dogstail. But then no one would kill the boy. ' If thou wilt give me another hundred
cows I will kill him,' says the father. The Apri verses'* are
said, and the fire is carried around the boy. He is about to
be slain. Then Dogstail prays to 'the first of gods,' the Father-god, for protection. But the Father-god tells him to pray to Agni, ' the nearest of the gods.' Agni sends him to
another, and he to another, till at last, when the boy has
prayed to all the gods, including the All-gods, his fetters drop
1 This is the germ of the pilgrimage-doctrine (see below). - Perhaps (IW. ix. 301) interpolated ; or the first allusion to the Four Ages. 3 These (compare afri, 'blessing,' in the A vesta) are verses in the Rig ^'eda introducing the sacrifice. They are meant as propitiations, and appear to be an ancient part of the ritual.



THE SACRIFICE OF DOGSTAIL. 213
off ; Harigcandra's dropsy ceases, and all ends well.' Only, when the avaricious father demands his son back, he is refused, and Vigvamitra adopts the boy, even dispossessing his own
protesting sons. For fifty of the latter agree to the exaltation
of Dogstail; but fifty revolt, and are cursed by Vigvamitra,
that their sons' sons should become barbarians, the Andhras, Pundras, Qabaras, Pulindas, and Mutibas, savage races (of this time), one of which can be located on the southeast coast.
The conclusion, and the matter that follows close on this tale,
is significant of the time, and of the priest's authority. For it
is said that 'if a king hears this story he is made free of sin,'
but he can hear it only from a priest, who is to be rewarded for telling it by a gift of one thousand cows, and other rich goods.
The matter following, to which we have alluded, is the use
of sacrificial formulae to defeat the king's foes, the description of a royal inauguration, and, at this ceremony, the oath which
the king has to swear ere the priest will anoint him (he is
anointed with milk, honey, butter, and water, ' for water is immortality ') : "I swear that thou mayst take from me whatever good works I do to the day of my death, together with my life and children, if ever I should do thee harm."^
When the priest is secretly told how he may ruin the king by a false invocation at the sacrifice, and the king is made to swear that if ever he hurts the priest the latter may rob him of
earthly and heavenly felicity, the respective positions of the
two, and the contrast between this era and that of the early hymns, become strikingly evident. It is not from such an age as this that, one can explain the spirit of the Rig Veda.
1 A group of hymns in the first book of the Rig Veda are attributed to Dogstail. At any rate, they do allude to him, and so prove a moderate antiquity (probably the middle period of the Rik) for the tale. The name, in Sanskrit Qunasgepa, has been ingeniously starred by Weber as Cynosoura ; the last part of each compound having the same meaning, and the first part being even phonetically the same {^unas, Kvv6s). 2 Ait, Br. viii. lo, 15, 20.



214 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The next selection is the famous story of the flood, which
we translate literally in its older form.^ The object of the legend in the Brahmana is to explain the importance of the
Ida (or Ila) ceremony, which is identified with Ida, Manu's
daughter. " In the morning they brought water to Manu to wash with, even as they bring it to-day to wash hands with. While he was washing a fish came into his hands. The fish said, ' Keep me, and I will save thee.' 'What wilt thou save me from?' ' A flood will sweep away all creatures on earth. I will save
thee from that.' ' How am I to keep thee .-" 'As long as we
are small,' said he (the fish), ' we are subject to much destruc
tion ; fish eats fish. Thou shalt keep me first in a jar. When
I outgrow that, thou shalt dig a hole, and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou shalt take me down to the sea,
for there I shall be beyond destruction.'
" It soon became a (great horned fish called a) jhasha, for
this grows the largest, and then it said : ' The flood will come this summer (or in such a year). Look out for (or worship) me, and build a ship. When the flood rises, enter into the ship, and I will save thee.' After he had kept it he took it down to the sea. And the same summer (year) as the fish had told him he looked out for (or worshipped) the fish ; and built a ship. And when the flood rose he entered into the ship. Then up swam the fish, and Manu tied the ship's rope to the horn of the fish ; and thus he sailed swiftly up toward the mountain of the north. ' I have saved thee ' said he (the' fish). ' Fasten the ship to a tree. But let not the water leave thee stranded while thou art on the mountain (top). Descend slowly as the water goes down.' So he descended slowly, and that descent of the mountain of the north is called the
1 The epic has a later version. This earlier form is found in (^ai. Br. i, 8. i. For the story of the flood among the American Indians compare Schoolcraft {Historical and Statistical Information)^ i. I'j.



THE STORY OF THE FLOOD. 215
' Descent of Manu.' The flood then swept off all the creatures of the earth, and Manu here remained alone. Desirous ai posterity, he worshipped and performed austerities. While he
was performing a sacrifice, he offered up in the waters clarifled butter, sour milk, whey and curds. Out of these in a year was produced a woman. She arose when she was solid, and clarified butter collected where she trod. Mitra and Varuna met her, and said : 'Who art thou? ' 'Manu's daughter,' said she. ' Say ours,' said they. ' No,' said she ;
' I am my father's.' They wanted part in her. She agreed to this, and she did not agree ; but she went by them and came to Manu. Said Manu: 'Who art thou?' 'Thy daughter,' said she. 'How my daughter, glorious woman ? ' She said : ' Thou hast begotten me of the offering, which thou madest in the water,
.clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. I am a blessing;
use me at the sacrifice. If thou usest me at the sacrifice, thou shalt become rich in children and cattle. Whatever blessing thou invokest through me, all shall be granted to thee.' So he used her as the blessing in the middle of the' sacrifice. For what is between the introductory and final offerings is the middle of the sacrifice. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he
begot the race of men on earth, the race of Manu ; and whatever the blessing he invoked through her, all was granted
unto him. " Now she is the same with the Ida ceremony ; and whoever, knowing this, performs sacrifice with the Ida, he begets the race that Manu generated ; and whatever blessing he invokes
through her, all is granted unto him." There is one of the earhest avatar stories in this tale.
Later writers, of course, identify the fish with Brahma and
with Vishnu. In other early Brahmanas the avatars of a god as a tortoise and a boar were known long before they
were appropriated by the Vishnuites.



CHAPTER X.
BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS.
In the Vedic hymns man fears the gods, and imagines God. In the Brahmanas man subdues the gods, and fears God. In the Upanishads man ignores the gods, and becomes God.^ Such in a word is the theosophic relations between the three periods represented by the first Vedic Collection, the
ritualistic Brahmanas, and the philosophical treatises called Upanishads. Yet if one took these three strata of thought to be quite independent of each other he would go amiss.^ Rather is it true that the Brahmanas logically continue what, the hymns begin ; that the Upanishads logically carry on the thought of the Brahmanas. And more, for in the oldest
Upanishads are traits that connect this class of writings (if they were written) directly, and even closely with the Vedic hymns themselves ; so that one may safely assume that the
time of the first Upanishads is not much posterior to that of the latest additions made to the Vedic collections, though this
indicates only that these additions were composed at a much later period than is generally supposed.^ In India no literary period subsides with the rise of its eventually ' succeeding
'
period. All the works overlap. Parts of the Brahmanas succeed, sometimes with the addition of whole books, their proper
i Compare (^at. Br, ii, 4. a. 1-6, where the Father-god gives laws of conduct ; and Kaushitaki Brahmana Upanishad, 3. S : " This spirit (breath) is guardian of the world, the lord of the' world ; he is my spirit " (or, myself), sa ma dima. The Brahmanic priest teaches that he is' a god like other gods, and goes so far as to say that he may be united with a god after death. The Upanishad philosopher says ' I am God.' 2 Compare Scherman, Philosophische Hyninen^ p. 93 ; above, p. 156.



BRAIIMANIC PANTHEISM.— THE UPANISHADS. 217
literary successors, the Upanishads. Vedic hymns are com
posed in the Brahmanic period.^ The prose Sutras, which, in
general, are earlier, sometimes post-date metrical Qastra-rules. Thus it is highly probable that, whereas the Upanishads began before the time of Buddha, the Qatapatha Brahmana (if not others of this class) continued to within two or three centuries of our era ; that the legal Sutras were, therefore, contemporary with part of the Brahmanic period ;
'^ and that, in short, the end of the Vedic period is so knit with the beginning of the Brahmanic, while the Brahmanic period is so knit with the rise of the Upanishads, Sutras, epics, and Buddhism, that one can
not say of any one : 'this is later,' 'this is earlier'; but each
must be taken only for a phase of indefinitely dated thought,
exhibited on certain lines. It must also be remembered that by the same class of works a wide geographical area may be represented ; by the Brahmanas, west and east ; by the Sutras, north and south ; by the Vedic poems, northwest and east to Benares (AV.) ; by the epics, all India, centred about the
holy middle land near Delhi. The meaning of Upanishad as used in the compositions
themselves, is either, as it is used to-day, the title of a
philosophical work ; that of knowledge derived from esoteric
teaching ; or the esoteric teaching itself. Thus brakma upanishad is the secret doctrine of brakma, and ' whoever follows this upanishad' means whoever follows this doctrine. This seems, however, to be a meaning derived from the nature of the Upanishads themselves, and we are almost inclined to think that the true significance of the word was originally that in which alone occurs, in the early period, the
combination upa-ni-sad, and this is purely external : " he makes
1 Or, in other words, the thought of the Brahmanic period (not necessarily of extant Brahmanas) is synchronous with part of the Vedic collection. 2 The last additions to this class of literature would, of course, conform in language to their models, just as the late Vedic Mantras conform as well as their composers can make them to the older song or chandas style.



218 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the common people upa-ni-sadin" i.e., 'sitting below' or 'sub
ject,' it is said in Qat. JBr. ix. 4. 3. 3 (from the literal meaning
of 'sitting below ').^ Instead, therefore, of seeing in tipanisad,
Upanishad, the idea of a session, of pupils sitting down to
hear instruction (the prepositions and verb are never used in
this sense), it may be that the Upanishads were at first subsidiary works of the ritualistic Brahmanas contained in the Aranyakas or Forest Books, that is, appendices to the Brah
mana, ostensibly intended for the use of pious forest-hermits (who had passed beyond the need of sacrifice) ; and this, in
point of fact, is just what they were ; till their growth resulted in their becoming an independent branch of literature. The usual explanation of ' Upanishad,' however, is that it represents
the instruction' given to the pupil 'sitting under' the teacher. Although at present t)etween two and three hundred Upanishads are known, at least by name, to exist, yet scarcely a
dozen appear to be of great antiquity. Some of these are integral parts of Brahmanas, and apparently were added to the
ritualistic works at an early period.^ While man's chief effort in the Brahmanic period seems to
be by sacrifice and penance to attain happiness hereafter, and to get the upper hand of divine powers ; while he recognizes a God, who, though supreme, has yet, like the priest himself, attained his supremacy by sacrifice and penance ; while he dreams of a life hereafter in heavenly worlds, in the realm of light, though hardly seeking to avoid a continuation of earthly re-births ; nevertheless he frees himself at times from ritualistic observances sufficiently to continue the questioning asked by his Vedic ancestors, and to wonder whither his immortal part
is definitively going, and whether that spirit of his will live independently, or be united with some higher power, such as the sun or Brahma.

BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 219
The philosophical writings called Upanishads ^ take up this question in earnest, but the answer is already assured, and the philosophers, or poets, of this period seek less to prove the
truth than to expound it. The soul of man will not only join a heavenly Power. It is part of that Power. Man's spirit
(self) is the world-spirit. And what is this ? While all the
Upanishads are at one in answering the first question, they are not at one in the method by which they arrive at the same result. There is no systematic philosophy ; but a tentative, and more or less dogmatic, logic. In regard to the second
question they are still less at one; but in general their answer
is that the world-spirit is All, and everything is a part of It or
Him. Yet, whether that All is personal or impersonal, and
what is the relation between spirit and matter, this is still an unsettled point. The methods and results of this half-philosophical literature will most easily be understood by a few examples. But, before
these are given, it will be necessary to emphasize the colloquial and scrappy nature of the teaching. Legend, parable, ritual
istic absurdities, belief in gods, denial of gods, belief in heaven, denial of heaven, are all mingled, and for a purpose. For some men are able, and some are unable, to receive the true light of knowledge. But man's fate depends on his knowledge. The wise man becomes hereafter what his knowledge has pre
pared him to be. Not every spirit is fitted for immortality, but
only the spirit of them that have wisely desired it, or, rather,
1 The relation between the Brahmanag (ritual works discussed in the last chapter) and the early Upanishads will be seen better with the help of a concrete example. As has been explained before, Rig Veda means to the Hindu not only the ' Collection ' of hymns, but all the library connected with this collection ; for instance, the two Brahmanas (of the Rig Veda), namely, the Aitareya and the KSushltaki (or CJankhayana), Now, each of these Brahmanas concludes with an Aranyaka, that is, a Forest-Book (aranya, forest, soHtude); and in each Forest Book is an Upanishad. For example, the third book of the Kaushitaki Aranyaka is the Kaushitaki Upanishad. So the Chandogya and Brihad Aranyaka belong respectively to the Saman and Yajus.



220 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
1 not desired it ; for every desire must have been extinguished before one is fitted for this end. Hence, with advancing belief in absorption and pantheism, there still lingers, and
not as a mere superfluity, the use of sacrifice and penance.
Rites and the paraphernalia of religion are essential till one
learns that they are unessential. Desire will be gratified till
one learns that the most desirable thing is lack of desire. But
so long as one desires even the lack of desire he is still in the fetters of desire. The way is long to the extinction of emotion, but its attainment results in happin^s that is greater than
delight ; in peace that surpasses joy.
In the exposition of this doctrine the old gods are retained
as figures. They are not real gods. But they are existent forms of God. They are portions of the absolute, a form of the Eternal, even as man is a form of the same. Absolute being, again, is described as anthropomorphic. ' This is that
'
under a certain form. Incessantly made is the attempt to explain the identity of the absolute with phenomena. The power (prahma), which is originally applied to prayer, is now taken as absolute being, and this, again, must be equated with the personal spirit (ego, self, atma). One finds himself back in the age of Vedic speculation when he reads of prayer (or penance) and power as one. For, as was shown above, the Rig Veda already recognizes that prayer is power. There the word for power, brahma, is used only as equivalent of prayer, and Brihaspati or Brahmanaspati is literally the 'god of power,'
as he is interpreted by the priests. The significance of the other great word of this period, namely atma, is not at all
uncertain, but to translate it is difficult. It is breath, spirit,
self, soul. Yet, since in its original sense it corresponds to spiritus (comparable to athmen), the word spirit, which also
signifies the real person, perhaps represents it best. We shall then render brahma and atma by the absolute and the ego or spirit, respectively ; or leave them, which is perhaps the he^t



BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 221
way, in their native form. The physical breath, prana, is occa
sionally used just like atnid. Thus it is said that all the gods
are one god, and this is prana, identical with brahma (Brihad
Aranyaka Upanishad, 3. 9. 9); ox prana is so used as to be the same with spirit, though, on the other hand, ' breath is born of
spirit' (Pragna Up. 3. 3), just as in the Rig Veda (above) it is said that all comes from the breath of God.
One of the most instructive of the older Upanishads is the
Chandogya. A sketch of its doctrines will give a clearer idea of Upanishad philosophy than a chapter of disconnected excerpts
:
All this (universe) is brahma. Man has intelligent force (or
will). He, after death, will exist in accordance with his will
in life. This spirit in (my) heart is that mind-making, breath
bodied, light-formed, truth-thoughted, ether-spirited One, of
whom are all works, all desires, all smells, and all tastes ; who comprehends the universe, who speaks not and is not moved
;
smaller than a rice -corn, smaller than a mustard -seed. . . . greater than earth, greater than heaven. This (universal
being) is my ego, spirit, and is brahma, force (absolute being).
After death I shall enter into him (3. 14).^ This all is breath
(= spirit in 3. 15. 4). After this epitome of pantheism follows a ritualistic bit
:
Man is sacrifice. Four and twenty years are the morning
libation ; the next four and forty, the mid-day libation ; the
next eight and forty, the evening libation. The son of Itara, knowing this, lived one hundred and sixteen years. He who knows this lives one hundred and sixteen years (3. 16).
Then, for the abolition of all sacrifice, follows a chapter
which explains that man may sacrifice symbolically, so that,
1 This teaching is ascribed to (Jandilya, to whose heresy, as opposed to the pure Vedantic doctrine of C^ankara, we shall have to revert in a later chapter. The heresy consists, in a word, in regarding the individual spirit as at any time distinct from the Supreme Spirit, though Qandilya teaches that it is ultimately absorbed into the
latter.



222 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
for example, gifts to the priests (a necessary adjunct of a real
/ sacrifice) here become penance, liberality, rectitude, non-injury,
truth-speaking {ib. 17. 4)'. There follows then the identifica
tion of brahma with mind, sun, breath, cardinal points, ether,
etc., even puns being brought into requisition, Ka is Kha and
Kha is Ka (4. 10. 5);^ earth, fire, food, sun, water, stars, man,
are brahma, and brahma is the man seen in the moon (4. 12. i). And now comes the identity of the impersonal brahma with the
personal spirit. The man seen in the eye is the spirit ; this is
the immortal, unfearing brahma (4. 15. i =8. 7. 4). He that knows this goes after death to light, thence to day, thence to
the light moon, thence to the season, thence to the year, thence to the sun, thence to the moon, thence to lightning ; thus he becomes divine, and enters brahma. They that go on this path of the gods that conducts to brahma do not return to
human conditions {ib. iS- 6). . But the Father-god of the Brahmanas is still a temporary creator, and thus he appears now {ib. 17): The Father-god brooded over^ the worlds, and from them extracted essences, fire from earth, wind from air, sun from sky. These three
divinities (the triad, fire, wind, and sun) he brooded over, and
from them extracted essences, the Rig Veda from fire, the Yajur Veda from wind, the Sama Veda from sun. In the preceding the northern path of them that know the absolute {brahma') has been described, and it was said that they return no more to earth. Now follows the southern path of them that only partly know brahm.a : " He that knows the oldest, j'ycstham, and the best, (resiham, becomes the oldest and the best. Now breath is oldest and best " (then follows the famous parable of the senses and
bteath, 5. I. 1). This (found elsewhere) is evidently regarded
1 " God ' Who ' is air, air (space) is God ' Who,' " as if one said ' either is aether.' 2
' Did penance over,' as one doing penance remains in meditation. 'Brooded' is Miiller's apt word for this abhi-tap.



BRAHMAXIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 223
as a. new doctrine, for, after the deduction has been made that, because a creature can Hve without senses, and even without mind, but cannot live without breath, therefore the
breath is the ' oldest and best,' the text continues, ' if one told this to a dry stick, branches would be produced and leaves put forth' (5. 2. 3).i The path of him that partly knows the
brahma which is expressed in breath, etc., is as follows : He goes to the moon, and, when his good works are used up, he (ultimately mist) rains down, becoming seed, and begins life over again on earth, to become like the people who eat him
(5. 10. 6); they that are good become priests, warriors, or members of the third estate ; while the bad become dogs, hogs,
or members of the low castes.^ A story is now told, instructive
as illustrating the time. Five great doctors of the law came together to discuss what is Spirit, what is brahma. In the
end they are taught by a king that the universal Spirit is
oiie's own spirit '(5. 18. i).
It is interesting to see that, although the Rig Veda distinctly says that ' being was born of not-being ' (dsatas sad ajdyata, x. 72. 3),^ yet not-being is here derived quite as emphatically from being. For in the philosophical explanation of the universe given in 6. 2. i ff. one reads: "Being alone existed in the beginning, one, and without a second. Others say ' notbeing alone '
. . . but how could being be born of not-being ? Baing alone existed in the beginning." * This being is then
represented as sentient. "It saw (and desired), 'may I be
miny,' and sent forth fire (or heat); fire (or heat) desired and
produced water ; water, food (earth) ; with the living spirit the

divinity entered fire, water, and earth " (6. 3). As mind comes from food, breath from water, and speecli from fire, all that makes a man is thus derived from the (true) being (6. 7. 6); and when one dies his speech is absorbed into mind, his mind into
breath, his breath into fire (heat), and heat iiito the highest
godhead (6. 8. 7). This is the subtile spirit, that is the Spirit,
that is the True, and this is the spirit of man. Now comes the grand conclusion of the Chandogya. He who knows the ego escapes grief. What is the ego ? The Vedas are names, and he that sees brahtna in the Vedas is indeed (partly) wise
;
but speech is better than a name ; mind is better than speech ;
will is better than mind ; meditation, better than will ; reflection, than meditation ; understanding, than reflection ; power, than understanding ; food, than power ; water, than food ; heat (fire), than water ; ether, than heat ; memory, than ether ; hope, than memory ; breath (= spirit), than hope. In each let one see brahma; ego in All. Who knows this is supreme in knowledge ; but more supreme in knowledge is he that knows that in true (being) is the highest being! True being is happiness
;
true being is ego ; ego is all ; ego is the absolute.-'
The relativity of divinity is the discovery of the Upanishads. And the relativity of happiness hereafter is the key-note of
their religious philosophy. Pious men are of three classes, according to the completed system. Some are good men, but
they do not know enough to appreciate, intellectually or spiritually, the highest. Let this class meditate on the Vedas. They desire wealth, not freedom. The second class wish, indeed, to emancipate themselves ; but to do so step by step ; not to
reach absolute brahma, but to live in bliss hereafter. Let these
worship the Spirit as physical life. They .will attain to the
1 As the Vedic notion of not-being existing before being is refuted, so the Atharvan homage to Time as Lord is also derided {gvei. 6) in the Upanishads. The supreme being is above time, as he is without parts («'^.). In this later Upanishad wisdom, penance, and the grace of God are requisite to know brahma.



BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 225
bliss of the realm of light, the realm of the personal creator. But the highest class, they that wish to emancipate themselves at once, know that physical life is but a form of spiritual life ;
that the personal creator is but a form of the Spirit ; that
the Spirit is absolute brahnia ; and that in reaching this they attain to immortality. These, then, are to meditate on spirit
as the highest Spirit, that is, the absolute. To fear heaven as 1
much as hell, to know that knowledge is, after all, the key to brahma ; that brahma is knowledge ; this is the way to emancipation. The gods are; but they are forms of the ego, and
their heaven is mortal. It is false to deny the gods. Indra
and the Father-god exist, just as men exist, as transient forms of brahma. Therefore, according to the weakness or strength of a man's mind and heart (desire) is he fitted to ignore gods and sacrifice. To obtain brahma his desires must be weak, his knowledge strong ; but sacrifice is not to be put away as useless. The disciplinary teaching of the sacrifice is a necessary preparation for highest wisdom. It is here that the Upanishads, which otherwise are to a great extent on the highway i to Buddhism, practically contrast with it. Buddhism ignores
the sacrifice and the stadia in a priest's life. The Upanishads retain them, but only to throw them over at the end when one has learned not to need them. Philosophically there is no
place for the ritual in the Upanishad doctrine • but their teachers stood too much under the dominion of the Brahmanas to ignore the ritual. They kept it as a means of perfecting the knowledge of what was essential. So ' by wisdom ' it is said ' one gets immortality.' The <^
Spirit develops gradually in man ; by means of the mortal he desires the immortal ; whereas other animals have only hunger and thirst as a kind of understanding, and they are
reborn according to their knowledge as beasts again. Such is the teaching of another of the Upanishads, the Aitareya
Aranyaka.



226 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
.This Upanishad contains some rather striking passages: "Whatever man attains, he desires to go beyond it; if he
should reach heaven itself he would desire to go beyond it "
(2. 3. 3. 1). "£}-ahf}ia is the A, thitlaer goes the ego" (2. 3. 8. 7). "A is the whole of Speech, and Speech is Truth, and
Truth is Spirit" (2. 3. 6. 5-14).^ "The Spirit brooded over the water, and form (matter) was born" (2. 4. 3. i ff.); so
physically water is the origin of all things" (2. i. 8. i).^ " Whatever belongs to the father belongs to the son, whatever belongs to the son belongs to the father" (Jb.). "Man has three births : he is born of his mother, reborn in the person
of his son, and finds his highest birth in death" (2. 5). In the exposition of these two Upanishads one gets at once the sum of them all. The methods, the illustrations, even the
doctrines, differ in detail ; but in the chief end and object of the Upanishads, and in the principle of knowledge as a means of attaining brahma, they are united. This it is that causes
the refutation of the Vedic ' being from not-being.' It is even said in the Aitareya that the gods worshipped breath (the spirit) as being and so became gods (great); while devils wor
shipped spirit as not-being, and hence became (inferior) devils
(2. I. 8. 6). It was noticed above that a king instructed priests. This interchange of the roles of the two castes is not unique. In the Kaushitaki Upanishad (4. 19), occurs another instance of a warrior teaching a Brahman. This, with the familiar illustration of a Gandhara (Kandahar) man, the song of the Kurus, and the absence of Brahmanic literature as such in the list of
1 This Vedic X670? doctrine is conspicuous in the Brahmana. Compare (^at. Br. vii. 5. 2. 21 : "Vac (X670S) is tlie Unborn one; from Vac the all-maker made creatures." See Weber, Ind. Stud. ix. 477 ff. 2 Compare J. U. B. i. 56. i, ' Water (alone) existed in the beginning.' This is the oldest and latest Hindu explanation of the matter of the physical universe. From the time of the Vedis to mediaeval times, as is recorded by the Greek travellers, water is regarded as the original element.



BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 227
works, cited vii. i, would indicate that the Chandogya was at least as old as the Brahmana literature.' In their present form several differences remain to be pointed out between the Vedic period and that of the Upanishads. The goal of the soul, the two paths of gods and of brahma, have been indicated. As already explained, the road to the absolute brahma lies beyond the path to the conditioned brahma. Opposed to this is the path that leads to the world of heaven, whence, when good works have been exhausted, the spirit descends to a new birth on earth. The course of this second path is conceived to be the dark half of the moon, and so back to man. Both roads lead first to the moon, then one goes on to brahma, the other returns to earth. It will be seen that good works are regarded as buoying a man up for a time,
till, like gas in a balloon, they lose their force, and he sinks down again. What then becomes of the virtue of a man who enters the absolute brahma, and descends no more ? He himself goes to the world where there is "no sorrow and no snow," where he lives forever {Brihad Aran. 5. 10); but "his beloved
relations get his virtue, and the relations he does not love get
his evil" (Kdushit. Up. i. 4). In this Upanishad fire, sun, moon, and lightning die out, and reappear as brahma. This is the doctrine of the Gdtterddmmerung, and succession of
aeons with their divinities (2. 12). Here again is it distinctly
stated that prana, breath, is brahma; that is, spirit is the
absolute (2. 13). What becomes of them that die ignorant of the ego ? They go either to the worlds of evil spirits, which are covered with
darkness — the same antithesis of light and darkness, as good
and evil, that was seen in the Brahmanas — or are reborn on
earth again like the wicked {T^d, 3). It is to be noted that at times all the parts of a man are

228 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
said to become immortal. For just as different rivers enter
tlie ocean and their names and forms are lost in it, so the sixteen parts of a man sink into the godhead and he becomes •without parts and immortal {Frafna Up. 6. 5) ; a purely pan
theistic view of absorption, in distinction from the Vedic view
of heaven, which latter, in the" form of immortal joy hereafter,
still lingers in the earlier Upanishads. It is further to be observed as the crowning point of these
speculations that, just as the bliss of emancipation must not
be desired, although it is desirable, so too, though knowledge is the fundamental condition of emancipation, yet is delight in the true a fatal error : " They that revere what is not knowledge enter into blind darkness ; they that delight in knowledge come
as it were into still greater darkness " (led, 9). Here, what is not real knowledge means good works, sacrifice, etc. But the sacrifice is not discarded. To those people capable only of
attaining to rectitude, sacrifices, and belief in gods there is
given some bliss hereafter ; but to him that is risen above this,
who knows the ego (Spirit) and real being, such bliss is no
bliss. His bliss is union with the Spirit. This is the completion of Upanishad philosophy. Before it is a stage where bliss alone, not absorption, is taught.' But
what is the ego, spirit or self (atind) ? First of all it is conscious ; next it is not the Person, for the Person is produced by the atmd. Since this Person is the type of the personal god, it is evident that the ego is regarded as lying back of personality. Nevertheless, the teachers sometimes stop with the latter. The developed view is that the immortality of the personal creator is commensurate only with that of the world
which he creates. It is for this reason that in the Mundaka
(i. 2. 10) it is said that fools regard fulfillment of desire in
1 Gough, Philosophy of the Upanishads, has sought to sho'W' that the pure Vedantism of C^ankara is the only belief taught in the Upanishads, ignoring the weight of those passages that oppose his (in our view) too sweeping assertion.



BRAHAIANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 229
heavenly happiness as the best thing ; for although they have their reward in the top of heaven, yet, when the elevation caused by their good works ends, as it will end, when the
buoyant power of good works is exhausted, then they drop down to earth again. Hence, to worship the creator as the, atma is indeed productive of temporary pleasure, but no more.
" If a man worship another divinity, devata, with the idea that he and the god are different, he does not know" {Brihad
Aran. Up. i. 4. 10). "Without passion and without parts" is
the brahma {Mimd. 2. 2. 9). The further doctrine, therefore, that all except brahma is delusion is implied here, and the " extinction of gods in brahma " is once or twice formulated.^ The fatal error of judgment is to imagine that there is in absolute being anything separate from man's being. When personified, this being appears as the supreme Person, identical with the ego, who is lord of what has been and what will be. By perceiving this controlling spirit in one's own spirit (or
self) one obtains eternal bliss ; " when desires cease, the mortal becomes immortal ; he attains bi-ahma here " in life
{Katha Up. 2. 5. 12 ; 6. 14; Br. Aran. Up. 4. 4. 7). How inconsistent are the teachings of the Upanishads in regard to cosmogonic and eschatological matters will be evident if one contrast the statements of the dijfferent tracts not only with those of other writings of the same sort, but even with other statements in the same Upanishads. Thus the Mundaka teaches first that Brahma, the personal creator, made the world and explained brahma (i. i. i). It then defines brahtna as the Imperishable, which, like a spider, sends out a web of
being and draws it in again (Jb. 6, 7). It states with all distinctness that the (neuter) brahma comes from The (masculine)
1 See the Parimara described, Ait. Br. viii. 28. Here brahma is wind, around
which die five divinities — lightning in rain, rain in moon, moon in sun, sun in fire,
fire in wind — and they are reborn in reverse order. The ' dying' is used as a curse.
The king shall say, • When fire dies in wind then may my foe die,' and he will die; so when any of the other gods dies around brahma.



230 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
One who is all-wise, all-knowing {ib. 9). This heavenly Person is the imperishable ego ; it is without form ; higher than the
imperishable (i, 2. 10 ff.; 2. i. 2); greater than the great
(3. 2. 8). Against this is then set (2. 2. 9) the great being
brahma, without passions or parts, i.e., without intelligence such
as was predicated of the atma , and (3. i. 3) then follows the doctrine of the personal ' Lord, who is the maker, the Person, who has his birth in brahma ' (^purusho brahmayonis) . That this
Upanishad is pantheistic is plain from 3. 2. 6, where Vedanta and Yoga are named. According to this tract the wise go to brahma or to ego (3. 2. 9 and i. 2. 11), while fools go to heaven and return again.
On the same plane stands the I^a, where atvia, ego. Spirit, is the True, the Lord, and is in the sun. Opposed to each other
here are ' darkness ' and ' immortality,' as fruit, respectively, of ignorance and wisdom. In the Kaushitaki Upanishad, taken with the meaning put into it by the commentators, the wise man goes to a very
different sort of brahma — one where he is met by nymphs, and rejoices in a kind of heaven. This brahma is of two sorts, absolute and conditioned ; but it is ultimately defined as 'breath.' Whenever it is convenient, 'breath' is regarded
by the commentators as ego, ' spirit ' ; but one can scarcely escape the conviction that in many passages ' breath ' was
meant by the speaker to be taken at its face value. It is the vital poWer. With this vital power (breath or spirit) one in dreamless sleep unites. Indra has nothing higher to say than that he is breath (spirit), conscious and immortal. Eventually the soul after death comes to Indra, or gains the bright heaven. But here too the doctrine of the dying out of the gods is known (as in Tditt. 3. 10. 4). Cosmogonically all here springs from
water (i. 4, 6, 7 ; 2. i, 12 ; 3. i, 2 ; 4. 20).
Most striking are the contradictions in the Brihad Aranyaka: " In the beginning there was only nothing ; this (world) was



BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM.— THE UPAXISHADS. 231
covered with death, that is hunger;' he desired," etc. (i. 2. i).
" In the beginning there was only ego (atma)." Atma articulated " I am," and (finding himself lonely and unhappy) divided himself into male and female,^ whence arose men, etc. (i. 4. i). Again : " In the beginning there was only braJima
;
this (neuter) knew atma . . . brahma was the one and only . . . it created" (i. 4. lo-ii); followed immediately by "he created" (12). And after this, in 17, one is brought back to " in the beginning there was only atma ; he desired ' let me
have a wife.' "
In 2. 3. I ff. the explicitness of the differences in brahma makes the account of unusual value. It appears that there are two forms of brahma, one is mortal, with form ; the other is
immortal, without form. Whatever is other than air and the space between (heaven and earth) is mortal and with form. This is being, its essence is in the sun. On the other hand,
the essence of the immortal is the person in the circle (of the sun). In man's body breath and ether are the immortal, the essence of which is the person in the eye. There is a visible and invisible brahma (atma) ; the real brahma is incompre
hensible and is described only by negations (3. 4. i ; 9. 26). The highest is the Imperishable {neuter), but this sees, hears,
and knows. It is in this that ether (as above) is woven
(3. 8. 11). After death the wise man goes to the world of the gods (1.5.16); he becomes the atma of all beings, just like that deity (i. 5. 20) ; he becomes identical ('how can one
know the knower?' vijnatar) in 2. 4. 12-13 ; and, according to 3. 2. 13, the doctrine of samsara is extolled ("they talked of karma, e^toWt A karma, secretly"), as something too secret to
be divulged easily, even to priests. That different views are recognized is evident from Taitt. 2. 6: "If one know^ brahma as asat he becomes only asat
1 Compare sterben, starve. 2 The androgynous creator of the Brahmanas.



232 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
(non-existence) ; if he knows tliat ' brahma is ' {i.e., a sad brahmd), people know him as thence existing." Personal atma is here insisted on ("He wished 'may I be many' "); and from attnd, the conscious brahma, in highest heaven, came the ether (2. 1, 6). Yet, immediately afterwards: "In the beginning was the non-existent ; thence arose the existent ; and That made for himself an ego (spirit, conscious life, atma; tad dtmdnam svayam akuruta, 2. 7). In man brahma is the sunbrahma. Here too one finds the brahtnanah pariijiaras (3. 10. 4
= Kaushit. 2. 12, ddivd), or extinction of gods in brahma. But
what that brahma is, except that it is bliss, and that man after death reaches 'the bliss-making dtmd,' it is impossible to say
(3. 6; 2. 8). Especially as the departed soul 'eats and sits
down singing' in heaven (3. 10. 5). The greatest discrepancies in eschatology occur perhaps in the Aitareya Aranyaka. After death one either "gets brahma "
(i. 3. I. 2), "comes near to the immortal spirit" (i. 3. 8. 14), or goes to the "heavenly world." Knowledge here expressly conditions the hereafter ; so much so that it is represented not
(as above) that fools go to heaven and return, but that all, save the very highest, are to recognize a personal creator (Prajapati) in breath (= ego =^brahjna'), and then they will "go to the heavenly world " (2. 3. 8. 5), "become the sun" (2. i". 8. 14), or "go to gods" (2. 2. 4. 6). Moreover after the highest wisdom has been revealed, and the second class of men has been disposed of, the author still returns to the ' shining
sky,' svarga, as the best promise (3). Sinners are born again
(2. I. I. 5) on earth, although hell is mentioned (2. 3. 2. 5).
The origin of world is water, as usual (2. i. 8. i). The highest
teaching is that all was atma, who sent forth worlds (lokan asrjatd), and formed the Person (as guardian of worlds), taking him from waters. Hence atma, Prajapati (of the second-class thinkers), and brahma are the same. Knowledge is brahma
(2. 4- I. I ; 6. I. s-7).



BRAHMANIC PANTHEISM. — THE UPANISHADS. 233
111 the Kena, where the best that can be said in regard to
brahma is that he is tadvana, the one that 'likes this' (or,
perhaps, is Mike this'), there is no absorption into a worldspirit. The wise 'become immortal'; 'by knowledge one gets immortality'; 'who knows this stands in heaven' (i. 2 ;
2- 4 ; 4- 9)- The general results are about those formulated by Whitney in regard to the Katha: knowledge gives continuation of happiness in heaven ; the punishment of the unworthy is to continue samsara, the round of rebirths. Hell is not mentioned in the Aitareya Upanishad itself but in the Aranyaka' (2. 3. 2. 5). That, however, a union with the universal dtma (as well as heaven) is desired, would seem to be the case from several of the passages cited above, notably Brihad Aran., i. 5. 20 {sa evafnvit sarvesdm bhutandm dtmd bhavati, yathidsa devatdivam so) ; 'he that knows this becomes the dtmd of all creatures, as is that divinity so is he ' ; though this is doubtless the dnanda
maya dtmd, or joy-making Spirit (Taitt. 2.8). Again two forms of brahma are explained (Mait. Up. 6.15 ff.)
:
There are two forms of brahma, time and not-time. That which was before the sun is not-time and has no parts. Time and parts begin with the sun. Time is the Father-god, the Spirit.
Time makes and dissolves all in the Spirit. He knows the Veda who knows into what Time itself is dissolved. This
manifest time is the ocean of creatures. But brahma exists
before and after time.^ As an example of the best style of the Upanishads we will
cite a favorite passage (given no less than four times in various versions) where the doctrine of absorption is most distinctly
taught under the form of a tale. It is the famous
1 We cannot, however, quite agree with Whitney who, loc. cit. p. 92, and Journal, xiii, p. ciii ff., impUes that belief in *ell comes later than this period. This is not so late a teaching. Hell is Vedic and Brahmanic. 2 This, in pantheistic style, is expressed thus (Qvet. 4) : ' When the liglit has arisen there is no day no night, neither being nor not-being; the Blessed One alone exists there. There is no likeness of him whose name is Great Glory."

DIALOGUE OF VAJNAVALKYA AND MAITREYI.i
Yajiiavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayani.
Now Maitreyi was versed in holy knowledge (brahttia), but Katyayani had only such knowledge as women have. But when Yajnavalkya was about to go away into the forest (to
become a hermit), he said: 'Maitreyi, I am going away from
this place. Behold, I will make a settlement between thee and
that Katyayani.' Then said Maitreyi: 'Lord, if this whole earth filled with wealth were mine, how then ? should I be immortal by reason of this wealth ? ' ' Nay,' said Yajnavalkya.
' Even as is the life of the rich would be thy life ; by reason of wealth one has no hope of immortality.' Then said Maitreyi
:
'With what I cannot be immortal, what can I do with that? whatever my Lord knows even that, tell me.' And Yajiiavalkya said : ' Dear to me thou art, indeed, and fondly speakest. Therefore I will explain to thee and do thou regard me as I explain.' And he said : ' Not for the husband's sake is a
husband dear, but for the ego's sake is the husband dear. Not for the wife's sake is a wife dear ; but for the ego's sake is a wife dear ; not for the son's sake are sons dear, but for the ego's sake are sons dear ; not for wealth's sake is wealth dear, but for the ego's sake is wealth dear ; not for the sake of the
Brahman caste is the Brahman caste dear, but for the sake of the ego is the Brahman caste dear ; not for the sake of the Warrior caste is the Warrior caste dear, but for love of the ego is the Warrior caste dear ; not for the sake of the worlds are worlds dear, but for the sake of the ego are worlds dear ; not for the sake of gods are gods dear, but for the ego's sake are
gods dear ; not for the sake of b/iiits (spirits) are bhtits dear,
but for the ego's sake are bkilts dear ; not for the sake of
anything is anything dear, but for love of one's self (ego) is anything (everything) dear; the ego (self) must be seen,

heard, apprehended, regarded, Maitreyi, for with the seeing, hearing, apprehending, and regarding of the ego the All is known. . . . Even as smoke pours out of a fire lighted with damp kindling wood, .even so out of the Great Being is blown out all that which is, Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva (-Angiras) Veda, Stories, Tales, Sciences, Upani
shads, food, drink, sacrifices ; all creatures that exist are blown
(breathed) out of this one (Great Spirit) alone. As in the ocean all the waters have their meeting-place ; as the skin is the
meeting-place of all touches ; the tongue, of all tastes ; the nose,
of all smells ; the mind, of all precepts ; the heart, of all knowledges ; ... as salt cast into water is dissolved so that one
cannot seize it, but wherever one tastes it is salty, so this Great
Being, endless, limitless, is a mass of knowledge. It arises out of the elements and then disappears in them. After death there is no more consciousness.-' I have spoken.' Thus said Yajnavalkya. Then said Maitreyi: 'Truly my Lord has bewildered me in saying that after death there is no more consciousness.' And Yajiiavalkya said : ' I say nothing bewildering, but what suffices for understanding. For where there
is as it were duality (dvditani), there one sees, smells, hears,
addresses, notices, knows another; but when all the universe has become mere ego, with what should one smell, see, hear, address, notice, know any one (else) ? How can one know him through whom he knows this all, how can he know the knower (as something different) ? The ego is to be described by negations alone, the incomprehensible, imperishable, un
attached, unfettered; the ego neither suifers nor fails. Thus, Maitreyi, hast thou been instructed. So much for immortality.' And having spoken thus Yajiiavalkya went
away (into the forest). Returning to the Upanishad, of which an outline was given in the beginning of this chapter, one finds a state of things

236 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
which, in general, may be said to be characteristic of the whole Upanishad period. The same vague views in regard to cosmogony and eschatology obtain in all save the outspoken sectarian tracts, and the same uncertainty in regard to man's
future fate prevails in this whole cycle.'' A few extracts will show this. According to the Chandogya (4. 17. i), a personal creator, the old Father-god of the Brahmanas, Prajapati, made the elements proceed from the worlds he had 'brooded' over
(or had done penance over, ahhyatapat'). In 3. 19. i, not-being was first ; this became being (with the mundane egg, etc.). In sharp contradiction (6. 2. i) : 'being was the first thing, it
willed,' etc., a conscious divinity, as is seen in ib. 3. 2, where
it is a 'deity,' producing elements as 'deities' {ib. 8. 6) which it enters 'with the living aima' and so develops names and
forms (so Tditt. 2. 7). The latter is the prevailing view of the Upanishad. In i. 7. 5 ff. the atma is the same with the universal atmd ; in 3. 12. 7, the brahma is the same with ether without and within, unchanging; in 3. 13. 7, the 'light above
heaven' is identical with the light in man; in 3. 14. i, all is
brahma (neuter), and this is an intelligent universal spirit.
Like the ether is the dtmd in the heart, this is brahma (ib. 2 ff.)
;
in 4. 3, air and breath are the two ends (so in the argument above, these are immortal as distinguished from all else) ; in 4.
10. 5 yad vdvd kaiii tad eva kham (brahma is ether) ; in 4. 15.
I, the ego is brahma , in 5. 18. i the universal ego is identified
with the particular ego (atma) ; in 6. 8 the ego is the True, with which one unites in dreamless sleep ; in 6. 15. i, 'vcAo para
devata or 'highest divinity' enters man's spirit, like fealt in
water (ib. 13). In 7. 15-26, a view but half correct is stated
to be that ' breath ' is all, but it is better to know that yo bhumd
1 Some of the Upanishads have been tampered with, so that all of the contradictions may not be due to the composers. Nevertheless, as the unLertainty of opinion in regard to cosmogony is quite as great as that in respect of absorption, all the vagueness cannot properly be attributed to the efforts of later systematizers to bring the Upanishads into their more or less orthodox Vedantism.

tad amrtam, the immortal (all) is infinity, which rests in its own
greatness, with a corrective ' but perhaps it doesn't ' (^yadi vd
no). This infinity is ego and atrna}
What is the reward for knowing this ? One obtains worlds, unchanging happiness, brahma; or, with some circumnavigation, one goes to the moon, and eventually reaches brahma or obtains the worlds of the blessed (5. 10. 10). The round of existence, samsdra, is indicated at 6. 16, and expressly stated
in 5. 10. 7 (insects have here, a third path). Immortality is
forcibly claimed • 'The living one dies not' (6. 11. 3). He who knows the sections 7. 15 to 26 becomes dtmdnanda and " lord of all worlds " ; whereas an incorrect view gives perishable worlds. In one Upanishad there is a verse (J^vet. 4. 5) which would indicate a formal duality like that of the Sankhyas;^ but in general one may say that the Upanishads are simply pantheistic, only the absorption into a world-soul
is as yet scarcely formulated. On the other hand, some of the older Upanishads show traces of an atheistic and materialistic (asad) philosophy, which is swallowed up in the growing
inclination to personify the creative principle, and ultimately
is lost in the erection of a personal Lord, as in the latest Upanishads. This tendency to personify, with the increase of
special sectarian gods, will lead again, after centuries, to the
rehabilitation of a triad of gods, the trimurti, where unite Vishnu, Qiva, and, with these, who are more powerful; Brahma, the Prajapati of the Veda, as the All-god of purely pantheistic
systems. In the purer, older form recorded above, the picrusha
(Person) is sprung from the dtmd. There is no distinction
between matter and spirit. Conscious being (sat) wills, and
so produces all. Or dtmd comes first ; and this is conscious

23S THE RELIGIQNS OF INDIA.
sat, and the cause of the worlds ; which atmd eventually becomes the Lord. The atmd in man, owing to his environment, cannot see whole, and needs the Yoga discipline of asceticism to enable him to do so. But he ii the same ego
which is the All.
The relation between the absolute and the ego is through will. "This (neuter) . brahma willed, 'May I be many,' and created" (Chdnd., above). Sometimes tKe impersonal, and sometimes the personal "spirit willed" {Tditt. 2. 6). And when it is said, in Brihad Aran. 1.4. i, that "In the beginning
ego, spirit, dtmd, alone existed," one finds this spirit (self) to be
a form of braJima {ih. lo-ii). Personified in a sectarian sense, this spirit becomes the divinity Rudra Qiva, the Blessed One
(Qvetdfvatara, 3. 5, n).' In short, the teachers of the Upanishads not only do not declare clearly what they believed in regard to cosmogonic and
escha'tological matters, but many of them probably did not know clearly what they believed. Their great discovery was
that man's spirit was not particular and mortal, but part of the
immortal universal. Whether this universal was a being alive and a personal atmd, or whether this personal being was but a transient form of impersonal, imperishable being; ^ and whether
the union with being, brahma, would result in a survival of
individual consciousness, — thpse are evidently points they were not agreed upon, and, in all probability, no one of the sages was
certain in regard to them. Crass identifications of the vital
1 As is foreshadowed in the doctrine of grace by Vac in the Rig Veda, in the (^Det., the Katha, and the Mund. Upanishads fJC. z. 23; M. 3. -z. 3), but nowhere else, there enters, with the sectarian pliase, that radical subversion of the Upanishad doctrine which becomes so powerful at a latet date, the teaching that salvation is a gift of God. " This Spirit is not got by wisdom ; the Spirit chooses as his own the body of that man whom He chooses." ^' See above. As descriptive of the immortal conscious Spirit, there is the famous verse ; " If the slayer thinks to slay, if the slain thinks he' te slain ; they both understand not; this one (the Spirit) slays not, and is not slain" {Katha, 2. 19) j loosely rendered by Emerson, ' If the red slayer think he slays,' etc.

principle with breath, as one with ether, which is twice emphasized as one of the two immortal things, were provisionally accepted. Then breath and immortal spirit were made one. Matter had energy from the beginning, brahma ; or was chaos, asat, without being. But when asat becomes sat, that sat becomes brahma, energized being, and to as'at there is no
return. In eschatology the real (spirit, or self) part of man
(ego) either rejoices forever as a conscious part of the
conscious world-self, or exists immortal in brahyna — imperishable being, conceived as more or less conscious.-' The teachers recognize the limitations of understanding
:
" The gods are in Indra, Indra is in the Father-god, the Father
god (the Spirit) is in brahma" — "But in what is brahma
V
And the answer is, " Ask not too much " {Brihad. Aran. Up.
3-6). These problems will be those of the future formal philosophy. Even the Upanishads do not furnish a philosophy alto
gether new. Their doctrine of karma, their identification'
of particular ego and universal ego, is not original. The
'breaths,' the 'nine doors,' the 'three qualities,' the. p urnsha as identical with ego, are older even than the Brahmanas (Scher
man, loc. cit. p. 62). It is not a new philosophy, it is a new religion that the Upanishads offer.^ This is no religion of rites and ceremonies,
although the cult is retained as helpful in disciplining and teaching ; it is a religion for sorrowing humanity. It is a religion
that comforts the afflicted, and gives to the soul ' that peace which the world cannot give.' In the sectarian Upanishads
this bliss of religion is ever present. "Through knowing Him who is more subtile than subtile, who is creator of everything,
1 The fact remarked by Thibaut that radically different systems o£ philosophy are built upon the Upanishads is enough to show how ambiguous are the declarations of
the latter. 2 Compare Earth, Religions, p. 76.



240 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
who has many forms, who embraces everything, the Blessed
Lord — one attains to peace without end" {Cvet. 4. 14-15).
These teachers, who enjoin the highest morality (' self-restraint, generosity, and mercy ' are God's commandments in Brihad
Aran. 5. 2) refuse to be satisfied with virtue's reward, and, being able to obtain heaven, 'seek for something beyond.' And this they do not from mere pessimism, but from a convic
tion that they will find a joy greater than that of heaven, and more enduring, in that world where is " the light beyond the
darkness " i^Qvet. 3. 8); "where shines neither sun, moon, stars,
lightning, nor fire, but all shines after Him that shines alone, and through His light the universe is lighted" {Mimd. 2. 2. 10).
This, moreover, is not a future joy. It is one that frees from
perturbation in this life, and gives relief from sorrow. In the Chandogya (7. i. 3) a man in grief comes seeking this new knowledge of the universal Spirit; "For," says he, "I have heard it said that he who knows the Spirit passes beyond grief." So in the Iga, though this is a late sectarian work, it
is asked, " What sorrow can there be for him to whom Spirit alone has become all things ? " (7). Again, " He that knows the joy of brahvia, whence speech with mind turns away without apprehending it, fears not" {Tditt. 2. 4); for "fear comes only from a second" {Brihad Aran. Up. i. 4. 2), and when one recognizes that all is one he no longer fears death (ib. 4. 4.
IS)Such is the religion of these teachers. In the quiet assump
tion that life is not worth living, they are as pessimistic as was Buddha. But if, as seems to be the case, the Buddhist be
lieved in the eventual extinction of his individuality, their
pessimism is of a different sort. For the teacher of the Upanishads believes that he will attain to unending joy ; not the rude happiness of ' heave'n-seekers,' but the unchanging
bliss of immortal peace. For him that wished it, there was heaven and the gods. These were not denied ; they were as

real as the " fool " that desired them. But for him that conquered passion, and knew the truth, there was existence without the pain of desire, life without end, freedom from rebirth. The spirit of the sage becomes one with the Eternal; man becomes God.



CHAPTER XI.
THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH.
For a long time after the Vedic age there is little that gives
one an insight into the views of the people. It'may be presumed, since the orthodox systems never dispensed with the established cult, that the form of the old Vedic creed was kept
intact. Yet, since the real belief changed, and the cult became
more and more the practice of a formality, it becomes neces
sary to seek, apart from the inherited ritual, the faith which
formed the actual religion of the people. Inasmuch as this phase of Hindu belief has scarcely been touched upon elsewhere, it may be well to state more fully the object of the
present chapter. We have shown above that the theology of the Vedic period had resulted, before its close, in a form of pantheism, which v.'as accompanied, as is attested by the Atharva Veda, with a demon
ology and witch-craft religion, the latter presumably of high
antiquity. Immediately after this come the esoteric Brahmanas, in which the gods are, more or less, figures in the eyes of the priests, and the form of a Father-god rises into chief prom
inence, being sometimes regarded as the creative force, but at
all times as the moral authority in the world. At the end of this period, however, and probably even before this period
ended, there is for the first time, in the Upanishads, a new
religion, that, in some regards, is esoteric. Hitherto the secrets
of religious mysteries had been treated as hidden priestly wis
dom, not to be revealed. But, for the most part, this wisdom is really nonsense; and when it is said in the Brahmanas, at the end of a bit of theological mystery, that it is a secret, or



THE POPULAR BRAPTMANIC FAITH. 243
that 'the gods love that which is secret,' one is not persuaded by the examples given that this esoteric knowledge is intellectually valuable. But with the Upanishads there comes the antithesis of inherited belief and right belief. The latter is
public property, though it is not taught carelessly. The
student is not initiated into the higher wisdom till he is drilled in the lower. The most unexpected characters appear in the role of instructors of priests, namely, women, kings, and mem
bers of the third caste, whose deeper wisdom is promulgated oftentimes as something quite new, and sometimes is whispered in secret. Pantheism, samsara^ and the eternal bliss of the individual spirit when eventually it is freed from further
transmigration, — these three fundamental traits of the new religion are discussed in such a way as to show that they had no hold upon the general public, but they were the intellectual wealth of a few. Some of the Upanishads hide behind a veil of mystery; yet many of them, as Windisch has said, are, in a way, popular; that is, they are intended for a general public,
not for priests alone. This is especially the case with the pantheistic Upanishads in their more pronounced form. But still it is only the very wise that can accept the teaching. It
is not the faith of the people.
Epic literature, which is the next living literature of the Brahmans, after the Upanishads, takes one, in a trice, from the beginnings of a formal pantheism, to a pantheism already disintegrated by the newer worship of sectaries. Here the impersonal atma, or nameless Lord, is not only an anthropomorphic Qiva, as in the late Upanishads, where the philosophic brahma is equated with a long recognized type of divinity, but atma is
identified with the figure of a tlieomorphic man.

244 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Is there, then, nothing with which to bridge this gulf ? In our opinion the religion of the law-books, as a legitimate phase of Hindu religion, has beenToo^much ignored. The religion of Upanishad and Vedanta, with its attractive analo
gies with modern speculation, has been taken as illustrative
of the religion of a vast period, to the discrediting of the belief represented in the manuals of law. To these certainly the name of literature can scarcely be applied, but in their
rapport with ordinary life they will be found more apt than are the profounder speculations of the philosophers to reflect the religious belief taught to the masses and accepted by them. The study of these books casts a broad light upon that interval between the Vedic and epic periods wherein it is
customary to imagine religion as being, in the main, cult or philosophy. Nor does the interest cease with the yield of
necessarily scanty yet very significant facts in regard to eschatological and cosmogonic views. The gods themselves are
not what they are in the rites of the cunning priests or in the
dogmas of the sages. In the Hindu law there is a reversion
to Vedic belief ; or rather not a reversion, but here one sees again, through the froth of rites an3 the murk of philosophy,
the under-stream of faith that still flows from the old fount,
if somewhat discolored, and waters the heart of the people. At just what time was elaborated the stupendous system of rites, which are already traditional in the Brahmanas, can never be known. Some of these rites have to do with special ceremonies, such as the royal inauguration, some are stated
w»za-sacrifices.^ Opposed to these j-^wa-feasts is the simpler
and older fire-cult, which persists in the house-rituals. All of
these together make up a sightly array of sacriiices.^ The
1 Weber has lately published two monographs on the sacrifices, the Rajasuya and the Vajapeya rites, both full of interesting details and popular features. 2 The traditional sacrifices are twenty-one in number, divided into three classes^ of seven each. The formal divisions are (i) oblations of butter, milk, corn, etc.
;
(2) soma sacrifices; (3) animal sacrifices, regarded as part of the first two. The



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 245
soma-x\yM2X is developed in the Brahmanas. But with this class of works there must have been from ancient times another which treated of the fire-ritual, and of which the more
'
modern representatives are the extant Sutras. It is with
Sutras that legal literature begins, but these differ from the
ritualistic Sutras. Yet both are full of religious meat. In these collections, even in the more special, there is no arrangement that corresponds to western ideas of order. In a com
pleted code, for example, there is a rough distribution of subjects under different heads, but the attempt is only tentative, and each work presents the appearance of a heterogeneous mass of regulations and laws, from which one must pick out the law for which he is seeking. The earlier legal works were
in prose ; the later evolved codes, of which there is a large
number, in metre. It is in these two classes of house-ritual
and law-ritual, which together constitute what is called Smriti,
tradition-ritual (in distinction from the so-called Cruti, revela
tion-ritual), that one may expect to find the religion of the
time ; not as inculcated by the promoters of mystery, nor yet as disclosed by the philosopher, but as taught (through the
priest) to the people, and as accepted by them for their daily guidance in matters of every-day observance. We glance first
at the religious observances, for here, as in the case of the great sacrifices, a detailed examination would be of no more value than a collective impression ; unless, indeed, one were
hunting for folk-lore superstitions, of which we can treat now
only in the mass. It is sufficient to understand that, accord
ing to the house-ritual {grhya-siltra) and the law-ritual {dharma
sutra, and dhanna-^astra)^ for every change in life there was an appropriate ceremony and a religious observance ; for
every day, oblations (three at least); for every fortnight and
sacrifice of the new and full moon is to be repeated on each occasion for thirty years. A sattra, session, is a long sacrifice which may last a year or more. 1 The latter are the metrical codes, a part of Smriti (smrti).



246 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
season, a sacrifice. Religious formulae were said over the child yet unborn. From the moment of birth he was surrounded with observances.-' At such and such a time the child's head was shaved ; he was taken out to look at the sun ; made to eat from a golden spoon; invested with the sacred cord, etc., etc. When grown up, a certain number of years were passed with a Guru, or tutor, who taught the boy his Veda; and to whom he acted as body-servant (a study and office often cut short in the case of Aryans who were not priests). Of the sacraments alone, such as the observances to which we have just alluded, there are no less than forty accord
ing to Gautama's laws (the name-rite, eating-rite, etc.). The pious householder who had once set up his own fire, that is, got married, must have spent most of his time, if he followed directions, in attending to some religious ceremony. He had several little rites to attend to even before he might say his prayers in the morning ; and since even to-day most of these personal regulations are dutifully observed, one may assume that in the full power of Brahmanhood they were very straitly enforced.^
It is, therefore, important to know what these works, so closely in touch with the general public, have to say in regard to religion. What they inculcate will be the popular theology of completed Brahmanism. For these books are intended to give instruction to all the Aryan castes, and, though this instruction filtrates through the hands of the priest, one may be sure that the understanding between king and priest was such as to make
the code the real norm of justice and arbiter of religious
opinions. For instance, when one reads that the king is a prime
1 The Five Paramount Sacrifices (Observances) are, according to Manu iii. 70, study of the Veda (or teaching it) ; sacrifice to tlie Manes and to the gods ; offerings of foods to ghosts (or spirits) ; and hospitality. 2 In the report of the Or. Congress for 1880, p. 158 ff., WilHams has a very interesting account of the daily rites of the modern orthodox Hindu (' Rig Veda in Religious Service^).



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 247
divinity, and that, quid pro quo, the priest may be banished, but never may be punished corporally by the king, because the former is a still greater divinity, it may be taken for granted that such was received, opinion. When we come to take up
the Hinduism of the epic we shall point out that that work
contains a religion more popular even than that of the legal
literature, for one knows that this latter phase of religion was
at first not taught at all, but grew up in the face of opposi
tion. But for the present, before the rise of epic ' Hinduism,'
and before taking up the heretical writings, it is a great gain
to be able to scan a side of religion that may be called popular in so far as it evidently is the faith which not only was taught to the masses, but which, as is universally assumed in the law, the masses accept ; whereas philosophers alone accept the atvia religion of the Upanishads,' and the Brahmanas are not intended for the public at all, but only for initiated priests. What, then, is the religious belief and the moral position of the Hindu law-books ? In how far has philosophy affected public religion, and in what way has a reconciliation been affected between the contradictory beliefs in regard to the gods ; in regard to the value of works on the one hand, and of knowledge on the other ; in regard to hell as a means of punishment for sin on the one hand, and reincarnation (samsdra) on the other ; in regard to heaven as a reward of good deeds on the one hand, and absorption into God on the other
;
in regard to a personal creator on the one hand, and a First
Cause without personal attributes on the other ?
For the philosophical treatises are known and referred to in the early codes ; so that, although the completed systems postdated the Sutras, the cosmical and theological speculations of the earlier Upanishads were familiar to the authors of the
legal systems. The first general impression produced by a perusal of the law-books is that the popular religion has remained unaiiected



248 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
by philosophy. And this is correct in so far as that it must be put first in describing the codes, which, in the main, in keeping the ancient observances, reflect the inherited faith. When, therefore, one says that pantheism-' succeeded poly
theism in India, he must qualify the assertion. The philosophers are pantheists, but what of the vulgar ? Do they give up polytheism ; are they inclined to do so, or are they taught to do so ? No. For there is no formal abatement in the rigor of the older creed. Whatever the wise man thought, and whatever in his philosophy was the instruction which he imparted to his peers, when he dealt with tlie world about him
he taught his intellectual inferiors a scarcely modified form of
the creed of their fathers. How in his own mind this wise man reconciled the two sets of opinion has been shown above.
The works of sacrifice, with all the inherited belief implied by
them, were for him preparatory studies. The elasticity of his philosophy admitted the whole world of gods, as a temporary reality, into his pantheistic scheme. It was, therefore, neither
the hypocrisy of the Roman augur, nor the fear of results that
in his teaching held him to the inheritance he had received.
Gods, ghosts, demons, and consequently sacrifices, rites, ordeals, and formulae were not incongruous with his philosophical opinions. He himself believed in these spiritual powers and in the usefulness of serving them. It is true that he believed in their eventual doom, but so far as man was concerned they were jjr actic ally real. There was, therefore, not only no reason why the sage should not inculcate the old rites, but there was
every reason why he should. Especially in the case of pious but ignorant people, whose wisdom was not yet developed to a full appreciation of divine relativity, was it incumbent on
him to keep them, the lower castes, to the one religion that they could comprehend.
1 We ignore here the later distinction between the Vedanta andSankhya systems. Properly speaking, the latter is dualistic.



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 249
It is thus that the apparent inconsistency in exoteric and
esoteric beliefs explains itself. For the two are not contradictory. They do not exclude each other. Hindu pantheism includes polytheism with its attendant patrolatry, demonology, and consequent ritualism.^ With rare exceptions it was only the grosser religion that the vulgar could understand ; it was only this that they were taught and believed. •Thus the old Vedic gods are revered and worshipped by name. The Sun, Indra, and all the divinities embalmed in
ritual, are placated and ' satiated ' with offerings, just as they had been satiated from time immemorial. But no hint is given
that this is a form; or that the Vedic gods are of less account than they had been. Moreover, it is not in the inherited
formulae of the ritual alone that this view is upheld. To be' sure, when philosophical speculation is introduced, the Fathergod comes to the fore; Brahma^ sits aloft, indulgently advising
his children, as he does in the intermediate stage of the Brahmanas ; and ati7%a (brahma) too is recognized to be the real being of Brahma, as in the Upanishads.' But none of this
touches the practice of the common law, where the ordinary man is admonished to fear Yama's hell and Varuna's bonds, as he would have been admonished before the philosopher grew wiser than the Vedic seers. Only personified Right, Dharma, takes his seat with shadowy Brahma among the other gods.*
1 At a later date Buddha himself is admitted into the Brahmanic pantheon as an
avatar of the All-god ! 2 Sometimes regarded as one with Prajapati, and sometimes treated as distinct
from him. 3 Thus (for the priestly ascetic alone) in M. vi. 79 ; ' Leaving his good deeds to his loved ones and his evil deeds to his enemies, by force of meditation he goes to the
eternal brahma.' Here brahma; but in Gautama perhaps Brahma. 4 That is, when the latter are grouped as in the following list. Our point is that, despite new faith and new gods, Vedic polytheism is taught not as a form but as a reality, and that in this period the people still believe as of old in the old gods, though they also acknowledge new ones (below).



250 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
What is the speech which the judge on the bench is ordered to repeat to the witnesses? Thus says the law-giver Manu: "When the witnesses are collected together in the court, in the presence of the plaintiff and defendant, the (Brahman) judge should call upon them to speak, kindly addressing them in the following manner: 'Whatever you know has been done
in this affair . . . declare it all. A witness who in testifying
speaks the trfith reaches the worlds where all is plenty . . . such testimony is honored by Brahma. One who in testifying speaks an untruth is, all unwilling, bound fast by the cords of
Varuna,^ till an hundred births are passed.' . . . (Then, speaking to one witness) : ' Spirit (soul) is the witness for the
Spirit, and the Spirit is likewise the refuge of the Spirit.
Despise not, therefore, thine own spirit (or soul), the highest
witness of man. Verily, the wicked think ' no one sees us,' but the gods are looking at them, and also the person within (conscience). Dyaus, Earth, the Waters, (the person in the)
heart. Moon, Sun, Fire, Yama, Wind, Night, the twin Twilights,
and Dharma know the conduct of all corporeal beings. . . . Although, O good man, thou regardest thyself, thinking, ' I am
alone,' yet the holy one (saint) who sees the evil and the good, stands ever in thy heart. It is in truth god Yama, the son of Vivasvant, who resideth in thy heart ; if thou beest not at variance with him (thou needest) not (to) go to the Ganges and to the (holy land of) the Kurus (to be purified).' " Here there is no abatement in Vedic polytheism, although
it is circled round with a thin mist from later teachings. In the same way the ordinary man is taught tliat at death his
spirit (soul) will pass as a manikin out of his body and go to
Yama to be judged; while the feasts to the Alanes, of course, imply always the belief in the individual activity of dead ancestors. Such expressions as ' The seven daughters of
1 Compare Manu, ix. 245 : " Varuna is the lord of punishment and holdeth a sceptre (punishment) even over Idngs."



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 251
Varuna' {sapta varunlr imds, Agv. Grih. S. 2. 3. 3) show that even in detail the old views are still retained. There is no
advance, except in superstitions,' on the main features of the
old religion. So the same old fear of words is found, resultingin new euphemisms. One must not say 'scull,' kapala, but
call it bhagala, 'lucky' (Gaut. 9. 21); a factor in the making of African languages also, according to modern travellers.
Images of the gods are now over-recognized by the priest, for they must be revered like the gods themselves (Jb. 12; Par. Grih. S. 3. 14. 8. etc.). Among the developed objects of the cult serpents now occupy a prominent place. They are mentioned as worshipful in the Brahmanas. In the Sutra period offerings are made to snakes of earth, air, and heaven;
the serpents are ' satiated ' along with gods, plants, demons,
etc. (Cankh. 4. 9. 3; 15. 4; Kqv. 2. i. 9; 3. 4. i; Parask. 2. 14. 9) and blood is poured out to them (Agv. 4. 8. 27).^ But
other later divinities than those of the earliest Veda, such as Wealth (Kubera), and Dharma, have crept into the ritual. With the Vedic gods appears as a divinity in Khad. i. 5. 31 the lovegod Kama, of the Atharvan; while on the other hand Rudra the
beast-lord (Pagupati, Lord of Cattle), the 'kindly' Qiva, appears as 'great god,' whose namfes are Qankara, Prishataka, Bhava,
Qarva, Ugra, Igana (Lord); who has all names and greatness, while he yet is described in the words of the older text as ' the
god that desires to kill ' (Agv. 2. 2,2; 4. 8. 9, 19,'' 29, 32 ; Ait. jgr. 3. 34). On the other hand Vishnu is also adored, arid
that in connection with the Aoyos, or Vac {ib. 3. 3. 4). Quite
in Upanishad manner — for it is necessary to show that these

were then really known — is the formula ' thou art a student oiprana (Breath,) and art given over to Ka ' {ib. i. 20. 8.), or 'whom?' In Agvalayana no Upanishads are given in the
list of literature, which includes the ' Eulogies of men,' Itihasas,
Puranas, and even the Mahabharata (3. 3. i ; 4. 4). But in I. 13. I, Upanishad-rites (and that of a very domestic nature) are recognized, which would corroborate the explanation of Upanishad given above, as being at first a subsidiary work, dealing with minor points.' Something of the sciolism df the
Upanishads 'seems to lie in the prayer that of the four paths on which walk the gods the mortal may be led in that which bestows 'freedom from death' (Par. 3. i. 2); and many of the teachers famous in the Upanishads are now revered by name
like gods (Agv. 3. 4. 4, etc.). On turning from these domestic Sutras to the legal Sutras it becomes evident that the pantheistic doctrine of the Upanishads, and in part the Upanishads themselves, were already
familiar to the law-makers, and that they influenced, in some degree, the doctrines of the law, despite the retention of the older forms. Not only is samsara the accepted doctrine, but the atma, as if in a veritable Upanishad, is the object of religious devotion. Here, however, this quest is permitted only to the ascetic, who presumably has performed all ritualistic
duties and passed through the stadia that legally precede his own.
. Of all the legal Sutra-writers Gautama is oldest, and perhaps
is pre-buddhistic. Turning to his work one notices first that the Mimamsist is omitted in the list of learned'men (28. 49);^ but since the Upanishads and Vedanta are expressly mentioned, it is evident that the author of • even the oldest Sutra was

THE -POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 253
acquainted with whatever then corresponded to these works.^ The opposed teaching of hell versus samsara is found in
Gautama. But there is rather an interesting attempt to unite
them. Ordinarily it is to hell and heaven that reference is
made, e.g., ' the one that knows the law obtains the heavenlyworld ' (28. 52); 'if one speak untruth to a teacher, even in thought, even in respect to little things, he slays seven men
after and before him ' (seven descendants and seven ancestors, 23. 31). So in the case of witnesses: 'heaven (is the fruit) for
speaking the trutlj; otherwise hell ' (13. 7); 'for stealing (land) hell' (is the punishment, ib. 17). Now and then comes the philosophical doctrine : ' one does not fall from the world of
Brahma' (9. 74); 'one enters into union and into the same world with Brahma' (8. 25). But in 21. 4-6 there occurs the following statement: 'To be
an outcast is to be deprived of the works of the twice-born, and hereafter to be deprived of happiness; this some (call)
hell.' It is evident here that the expression asiddhis (deprivation of success or happiness) is placed optionally beside naraka (hell) as the view of one set of theologians compared with that of another; ' lack of obtaining success, i.e., reward' stands parallel to 'hell.' In the same chapter, where Manu
says that he who assaults a Brahman " obtains hell for one hundred years " (M. xi. 207), Gautama (21. 20) says "for one hundred years, lack of heaven " (asvargyani), which may mean hell or the deprivation of the result of merit, i.e., one hundred years will be deducted from his hea!venly life. In this case not a new and better birth but heaven is assumed to be the reward of good acts. Now if one turns to 11. 29-30 he finds both views combined. In the parallel passage in Apastamba
1 The commentator here (19. 12, cited by Biihler) defines Vedanta as the part of the Aranyakas which are not Upanishads, that is, apparently as a local ' Veda-end
'
(veda-anta), though this meaning is not admitted by some scholars, who ^ill see in anta only the meaning 'goal, aim.'



254 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
only better or worse re-births are promised as a reward for good or evil (2. 5. 11. lo-ii); but here it is said: "The castes and orders that remain by their duty, having died, having en
joyed the fruits of their acts, with the remnant of their (merit)
obtain re-birth, having an excellent country, caste, and family;
having long life, learning, good conduct, wealth, happiness, and
wisdom. They of different sort are destroyed in various ways." Here, heavenly joys (such as are implied by nihp-eyasani in 26) are to be enjoyed first, and a good birth
afterwards, and by implication one probablji has to interpret the next sentence to mean 'they are sent to hell and then
re-born in various low births.' This, too, is Manu's rule
(below). At this time the sacred places which purify are in great vogue, and in Gautama a list of them is given (19. 14), viz. : " all mountains, all rivers, holy pools, places of pilgrimage
(i.e., river-fords, tirthdni), homes of saints, cow-pens, and
altars." Of these the tlrthas are particularly interesting, as
they later become of great importance, thousands of verses in the epic being devoted to their enumeration and praise. Gautama says also that ascetics, according to some teachers, need not be householders first (3. i), and that the Brahman ascetic stays at home during the rainy season, like the heretic
monks (ib. 13). If one examine the relative importance of the
forms and spirit of religion as taught in this, the oldest dharmasutra^ he will be impressed at first with the tremendous weight laid on the former as compared with the latter. But, as was
said apropos of the Brahmanic literature, one errs who fails to appreciate the fact that these works are intended not to give
a summary of religious conduct, but to inculcate ceremonial rules. Of the more importance, therefore, is the occasional pause which is made to insist, beyond peradventure, on the superiority of moral rules. A very good instance of this is
found in Gautama. He has a list of venial sins. Since lying
1 The Rudra (Civa) invocation at 26. izff. is interpolated, according to Biihler.



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 255
is one of the most heinous offences to a Hindu lawgiver, and
the penances are severe, all the treatises state formally that an untruth uttered in fun, or when one is in danger, or an oath of
the sort implied by Plato : d^poSt'criov o/dkov ov <j>a(nv etvai,
all these are venial, and so are lies told to benefit a (holy)
cow, or to aid a priest ; or told from religious motives of any sort without self-interest. This is almost the only
example of looseness in morals as taught in the law. But the following case shows most plainly the importance of morality as opposed to formal righteousness. After all the forty sacraments (to which allusion was made above), have been re
counted, there are given ' eight good qualities of the soul,'
viz., mercy, forbearance, freedom from envy, purity, calmness, correct behavior, freedom from greed and from covetousness. Then follows : " He that has (performed) the forty sacraments
but has not the eight good qualities enters not into union with Brahma, nor into the heaven of Brahma.^ But he that has (performed) only a part of the forty sacraments and has the eight good qualities enters into union with Brahma, and into the heaven of Brahma." This is as near to heresy as prebuddhistic Brahmanism permitted itself to come.
In the later legal Sutra of the northern Vasistha'' occurs a
rule which, while it distinctly explains what is meant by liber
ality, viz., gifts to a priest, also recognizes the 'heavenly reward'
:
" If gifts are given to a man that does not know the Veda the
divinities are not satisfied" (3. 8). In the same work (6. i)
' destruction ' is the fate of the sinner that lives without ob
1 Here there is plainly an allusion to the two states of felicity of the Upanishads. Whether the law-giver believes that the spirit will be united with Brahma or simply live in his heaven he does not say. 2 Gautama, too, is probably a Northerner. The Siitra, it should be observed, are not so individual as would be implied by the name of the teachers to whom they are credited. They were each texts of a school, carana, but they are attributed uniformly to a special teacher, who represents the carana, as has been shown by Miiller. For what is known in regard to the .early ' Sutra-makers ' see Biihler's Introductions to volumes ii. and xiv. of the Sacred Books.

servance of good custom ; yet is it said in the same chapt (27): " If a twice-born man dies with the food of a Qudra (lowe
caste) in his belly, he would become a village pig, or he
born again in that (^udra's) family"; and, in respect to soi begotten when he has in him such food : " Of whom the foo of him are these sons ; and he himself would not mount heaven ... he does not find the upward path " (29, 28). 1 ib. 8. 17 the Brahman that observes all the rules ' does not fa from brahmaloka' i.e., the locality of Brahma. Further, :

the Manes, and evil spirits (asuras) are referred to in the fol
lowing chapter (20, 25); and hell in the same chapter is declared to be the portion of such ascetics as will not eat meat when requested to do so at a feast to the Manes or gods
(11. 34), — rather an interesting verse, for in Manu's code the corresponding threat is that, instead of going to hell 'for as
long, i.e., as many years, as the beast has hairs,' as here, one
shall experience 'twenty-one rebirths,' i.e., the hell-doctrine in terms of samsara; while the same image occurs in Manu in the form ' he that slaughters beasts unlawfully obtains as many
rebirths as there are hairs on the beast' (v. 35, 38). The passive attitude sometimes ascribed to the Manes is denied
;
they rejoice over a virtuous descendant (ir. 41); a bad one
deprives them of the heaven they stand in (16. 36). The authorities on morals are here, as elsewhere, Manu and other seers, the Vedas, and the Father-god, who with Yama gives
directions to man in regard to lawful food, etc. (14. 30). The > moral side of the code, apart from ritual impurities, is given, as usual, by a list of good and bad qualities (above), while
formal laws in regard to theft, murder (especially of a priest), adultery and drunkenness (20. 44; i. 20), with violation of caste-regulations by intercourse with outcasts, are ' great crimes.' Though older than Apastamba, who mentions the Purva-mimamsa, Vasistha, too, knows the Vedanta (3. 17), and the Mimamsa {jiikalpin^tarkin, 3. 20, M. xii. in From the Sutras of Baudhayana's probably southern school
something of additional interest is to be gained. Here ' dark
ness' takes the place of hell (2. 3. 5. 9), which, however, by a
citation is explained (in 2. 2. 3. 34) as ' Yama's hall.' A verse is
cited to show that the greatest sin is lack of faith (i. 5. 10. 6)
and not going to heaven is the reward of folly (ib. 7) ; while the
reward of virtue is to live in heaven for long (4. 8. 7). The same freedom in regard to ascetics as occurs in other Sutra
works is to be found in this author, not in the more suspicious

final chapters, but in that part of the work which is accepted as oldest/ and agrees with the data found in the Brahmanas, where
the pre-buddhistic monk is called Bhikshu, 'beggar,' or Sannyasin 'he that renounces,' just as these terms are employed in the heretical writings. As among the Jains (and Buddhists), the Brahmanic ascetic carries a few simple utensils, and wanders about from house to house and village to village, begging food. Some authorities (among the Brahmans) say that one may become an ascetic as soon as he has completed his study, though ordinarily this may be done only after passing through the householder stadium. On becoming an ascetic the beggar takes the
vow not to injure any living thing (Baudh. ii. lo. 17. 2. n, 29), exactly as the Jain ascetic takes the vow of non-injury. More
than this, as will be seen below, the details of the Brahman
ascetic's vows are almost identical with those of the Jain
ascetic. He vows not to injure living beings, not to lie, not
to steal, to be continent, to be liberal ; with the five minor
vows, not to get angry, to obey the Teacher, not to be rash,
to be cleanly and pure in eating.^ To this ascetic order in the Brahman priesthood may be traced the origin of the heretical monks. Even in the Brahmanas occur the termini technici of the Buddhist priesthood, notably the ^rainana or ascetic monk, and the word buddha, 'awakened' {pratibudh). The ' four orders ' are those enumerated as the householder, student, ascetic, and forest-hermit. If one live in all four
orders according to rule, and be serene, he will come to peace, that is, salvation (Apastamba, 2. 9. 21. i, 2).
According to this later legal writer, who belongs to Southern India/ it is only after one has passed through all the preceding
1 Compare Biililer's Introduction, p. xxxv. SEE. vol. xiv. 2 Baudh. ii. iS. 2-3. Compare Jacobi's Introduction, p. xxiiiff. of SEE. vol. xxii. 3 Eiihler (Introduction, p. xxxi) gives as the district of the Apastambiya school parts of the Bombay Presidency, the greater parts of the Nizam's possessions, and parts of the .Madras Presidency. Apastamba himself refers to Northerners as if they were foreigners {loc. cit.).



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 259
Stadia that he may give up works (sacrifice, etc.) and devote himself to seeking the ai'»za, 'wandering about, without caring for earth or heaven, renouncing truth and falsehood, pleasure and
pain' (ib. lo, 13). There follows this passage one significant of the opposition between purely Upanishad-ideas and those of the law-givers : 'Acquirement of peace (salvation) depends, it is said, on knowledge ; this is opposed by the codes. If on knowledge (depended) acquirement of peace, even here (in this world)
one would escape grief ' {ib. 14-16). Further, in describing the forest-hermit's austerities (ib. 23. 4 £f.)_, verses from a Purana are
cited which are virtually Upanishadic : ' The eight and eighty thousand seers who desired offspring (went) south on Aryaman's path, and obtained (as their reward) graves ; (but) the eight and eighty thousand, who did not desire offspring (went) north on Aryaman's path and make for themselves immor
tality,' that is to say ' abandon desire for offspring; and of the two paths (which, as the commentator observes, are mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad), that which gives immortality instead of death (graves) will be yours.' It is admitted that such ascetics have miraculous powers ; but the law-maker emphatically protests in the following Sutra against the supposition that a rule which stands opposed to the received rites
(marriage, sacrifice, etc.) is of any power, and asserts that for
the future life an endless reward (' fruit '), called in revelation
' heavenly,' is appointed (/i5. 8-11). The next chapter, how
ever, limits, as it were, this dogma, for it is stated that ifnmor
tality is the re-birth of one's self in the body of one's son, and a verse is cited: 'Thou procreatest progeny, and that's thy
immortality, O mortal,' with other verses, which teach that
sons that attend to the Vedic rites magnify the fame and heaven of their ancestors, who 'live in heaven until the de
struction of creation' (a bhutasamplavai, 2. 9. 24. 5). But ' according to the Bhavishyat-Purana ' after this destruction of creation 'they exist again in heaven as the cause of seed'



260 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
(ib. 6). And then follows a quotation from the Father-god
:
' We live with those people who do these (following) things : (attend to) the three Vedas, live as students, create children,
sacrifice to the Manes, do penance, make sacrifice to the gods,
practice liberality ; he that extols anything else becomes air
(or dust) and perishes ' (ib. 8) ; and further : ' only they that
commit sin perish ' (not their ancestors). The animus of this whole passage is apparent. The lawmaker has to contend with them that would reject the neces
sity of following in order the traditional stadia of a priest's
life; that imagine that by becoming ascetjcs without first having passed through the preliminary stadia they can by knowledge alone attain the bliss that is obtained by union with brahma (or Brahma). In other words the jurist has to contend with a trait eminently anti-brahmanistic, even Buddhistic. He denies this value of knowledge, and therewith shows that what he wishes to have inculcated is a belief in the temporary personal existence of the Manes; in heaven till the end of the world-order ; and the annihilation of the wicked ; while he has a confused or mixed opinion in regard to one's own personal immortality, believing on the one hand that there is a future existence in heaven with the gods, and on the other (rather a materialistic view) that immortality is nothing but continued existence in the person of one's descendants, who are virtually one's self in another body : dehatvam evd^nyat, " only the body
is different" '{ib. 2). As to cosmogony it is stated to be (not the emanation of an atma) but the " emission (creation) of the Father-god and of the seers " (the latter being visible as stars,
ib. 13, 14). In this there is plainly a received popular opinion, which reflects the Vedic and Brahmanic stage, and is opposed to the philosophical views of the Upanishads, in other words of the first Vedantic philosophy ; while it is mixed up with the .late doctrine of the cataclysms, which ruin each succeeding creation. The equal annihilation of the wicked [dhvamsanti')



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 261
and unorthodox (dhvamsate) is to be noticed. They are here
subject" neither to hell nor to rebirth, but they "become dust and perish " (Jb. 8, 9).
Throughout the whole legal literature one will find this same antithesis of views in regard to the fate of good and bad,
although it is seldom that annihilation is predicated of the
latter. Usually hell or rebirth are their fate — two views,
which no one can really reconcile. They are put side by side; exactly as in priestly discussion in India and Europe it still remains an unsettled question as to when the soul becomes immortal. "^ Occidental experience teaches how easy it is for such views to stand together unattacked, although they are the object of speculation. This passage is perhaps, histor
ically, the most satisfactory (as it is philosophically unsatis
factory) that can be cited in answer to the questions that were posed above. But from other parts of legal literature a few
more statements may be culled, to illustrate still further the lack of uniformity not only in popular belief, but in the teaching provided for the public. First from the same work of Apastamba, in 2. 11. 29. 9-10 it is said that if a witness in court perjure himself he shall be punished by the king, "and
further, in passing to the next world, hell" (is his portion); whereas " (the reward) for truth is heaven, and praise on the
part of all creatures." Now, let one compare first il>. 2. 5. 11. lo-ii: "Men of low castes are reborn in higher castes in suc
cessive births, and men of high castes in low castes, if they
respectively perform and neglect their duties." And then this
Vedantic passage of the same author (i. 8. 22£[.): ."Let one (as penance for sin) devote himself to the Yoga (mental discipline) which has to do with the highest atma. . . . Nothing is known higher than the acquisition of atma. We shall (now)
1 In India the latter question is: does the soul immediately at death unite with the atma or does it travel to it. In Europe : does the soul wait for the Last Day, or get to heaven immediately? Compare Maine, Early Law and Custom, p. 71.



262 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
cite some a/^za-acquisition-verses, viz.: All living creatures
(are) the citadel of him that rests in secret, the indestructible one, the immaculate one. Immortal they that devote themselves to the moveless one who has a movable dwelling . . . the great one whose body is light, universal, free . . . the
eternal (part) in all creatures, the wise, immortal, unchanging
one, limbless, voiceless, formless, touchless, purest, the highest goal. He that everywhere devotes himself to Him {atma as Lord), and always lives accordingly ; that by virtue of Yoga
recognizes Him, the subtile one, shall rejoice in the top of heaven. . . . He, atmd, comprehends all, embraces all, more
subtile than a lotus-thread and huger than the earth. . . . From him are created all bodies; he is the root, he the Ever
lasting, the Eternal One." This discipline it will be observed is enjoined as penance
and to get rid of faults, that is, to subdue the passions. As
the same chapter contains a list of the faults which are to be
overcome before one " arrives at peace " (salvation) they may
be cited here : " Anger, joy, wrath, greed, distraction, injury,
threats, lying, over-eating, calumny, envy, sexual desire, and
hate, lack of studying dtma^ lack of Yoga — the destruction of these (faults) is based on Yoga " (mental concentration). On the other hand : " He that devotes himself, in accordance with
the law, to avoiding anger, joy, wrath, greed, distraction, in
jury, threats, lies, over-eating, calumny and envy; and practices liberality, renunciation, uprightness, kindness, subduing (of
the passions), self-control ; and is at peace with all creatures ; and practi.ces Yoga ; and acts in an Aryan (noble) way ; and
does not hurt anything ; and has contentment — qualities
which, it is agreed, appertain to all the (four) stadia — he becomes sdrvagdmin" [ib. 23. 6), that is 'one belonging to the all-pervading ' (All-soul). There appears to be a contradiction between the former passage, where Yoga is enjoined on ascetics alone; and this, where Yoga is part of the discipline



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 263
of all four stadia. But what was in the author's mind was probably that all these vices and moral virtues are enumerated
as such for all ; and he slips in mental concentration as a virtue for the ascetic, meaning to include all the virtues he knows.
A few further illustrations from that special code which has won for itself a preeminent name, 'the law-book of Manu,'
^
will give in epitome the popular religion as taught to the masses ; withal even better than this is taught in the Sutras. For Father Manu's law-book, as the Hindus call it, is a popular Qastra or metrical^ composite of law and religion, which reflects the opinion of Brahmanism in its geographical stronghold, whereas the Sutras emanate from various localities, north and south. To Manu there is but one Holy Land, the Kurus' plain and the region round-about it (near Delhi). The work takes us forward in time beyond even the latest Sutras, but the content is such as to show that formal Brah
manism in this latest stage still keeps to its old norm and to Brahmanic models. It deserves therefore to be examined with care from several points of view if one would escape from the belief of the philosopher to the more general teaching. In this popular religion
all morality is conditioned by the castes,^ which is true also to
a certain degree of the earlier Sutras, but the evil fruit of this
plant is not there quite so ripe as it is in the later code. The enormity of all crimes depends on who commits them, and against whom they are committed. The three upper castes
1 Thought by some scholars to have been developed out of the code of the Manavas ; but ascribed by the Hindus to Father Manu, as are many other verses of legal character contained in the epic and elsewhere. 2 Although Sutras may be metrical too in part, yet is the complete metrical form, as in the case of still later (Jastra, evidence that the work is intended for the general public. 8 The priest alone, in the post-Vedic age, has the right to teach the sacred texts
;
he has immunity from bodily punishment ; the right to receive gifts, and other special privileges. The three upper castes have each the right and duty of studying the sacred texts for a number of years.



264 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
alone have religious privileges. The lowest caste, outcasts, women, and diseased persons are not allowed to hear the holy
texts or take part in ceremonies.^ As to the rites, they are
the inherited ones, sacrifices to gods, offerings to Manes and spirits, and all the ceremonies of house and individual, as
explained above ; with especial and very minute rules of ob
servance for each of the four stadia of a priest's life.^ There is no hint in any of this of the importance of the knowledge of the atma. But in their proper place the rules of morality and the higher philosophical views are taught. The doctrine of re-birth is formally stated, and the attainment of the world of Brahma {brahmci) by union of ceremonies and knowledge is in
culcated. The ascetic should seek, by meditation, to go to
Brahma (or braJimd) for when he is utterly indifferent, then, both
here and after death, he gains everlasting happiness. Therefore he should study the Vedas, but especially the teachings in regard to the Supreme Spirit, and the Upanishads ; studying
the Vedanta is a regular part of his final discipline (vi. 74-94). In another part of the work the distinction made in the
Upanishads is upheld, that religious acts are of two sorts, one designed to procure bliss, and cause a good man to reach equality with the gods ; the other performed without selfish motive ; by which latter " even the five elements are overcome," that is, the absorption into brahma is effected. For "among all virtuous acts the knowledge of the spirit, atma, is highest
;
through this is obtained even immortality. One that sees
spirit in all things and all things in spirit sacrifices to spirit
and enters Brahma (or brahma)." "The spirit (or self) is all
1 Weber has shown, loc. cit., that the Qudras did attend some of the more popular ceremonies, and at first apparently even took a part in them. 2 The 'four orders ' or stadia of a priest's life, student, householder, hermit, ascetic, must not be confused with the 'four (political) orders' (castes), priest, warrior,
farmer, slave — to which, from time to time, were added many ' mixed castes,' as well as ' outcasts,' and natural pariahs. At the time of Manu's code there were already many of these half-assimilated groups.



THE POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 26S
divinities ; the All is based on spirit." And in Upanishadic vein the Person is then proclaimed as lord of gods, whom " some call fire, some call Manu, some call Indra, some call air, and some call eternal brahma." But though this be the view of the closing verses, yet in the beginning of the work is this Person represented as being produced from a First Cause. It would be out of place here to analyse the conflicting philosophical views of the Manu code. Even his commentators are uncertain whether he belonged to the pantheistic Vedanta or dualistic Sankhya school. For them that believe in no Manu the solution is simpler. Although Manu is usually called a Puranic Sankhyan, yet are both schools represented, and that without regard to incongruous teaching. Manu is no more Sankhyan than Vedantic. Indeed in the main part of the work the teaching is clearly more Vedantic. But it suffices here to point out that the a/wa-philosophy and religion
is not ignored ; it is taught as essential. Nevertheless, it is
not taught in such a way as to indicate that it is requisite for the vulgar. On the contrary, it is only when one becomes an
ascetic that he is told to devote himself to the pursuit of the knowledge of atma. In one passage there is evidence that two replies were given to this fundamental question in regard to works and knowledge. For after enumerating a list of good acts, among which are knowledge and Vedic ceremonies, it is asked which among them most tends to deliverance. The answer is vital. Or it should be, but it is given in an ambiguous form (xii. 85-6): "Amid all these acts the knowledge
of self, atma, is the highest, for it produces immortality. Amid all these acts the one most productive of happiness, both
after death and in this life, is the Vedic ceremony." Knowledge gives real immortality ; rites give temporary bliss.
The Upanishads teach that the latter is lower than the former,
but each answers the question. There were two answers, and Manu gives both. That is the secret of many discrepancies



266 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
in Hindu rules. The law-giver cannot admit absolutely and once for all that the Vedic ceremony is of no abiding use, as it can be of no use to one that accepts the higher teaching. He keeps it as a training and allows only the ascetic to be a philosopher indeed. But at the same time he gives as a sort of peroration to his treatise some ' elegant extracts ' from philo
sophical works, which he believes theoretically, although prac
tically he will not allow them to influence his ritualism. He
is a true Brahman priest.
It is this that is always so annoying in Brahmanic philos
ophy. For the slavery of tradition is everywhere. Not only does the ritualist, while admitting the force of the philosopher's reasons, remain by Vedic tradition, and in consequence refuse to supplant ' revelation ' with the higher wisdom and better religion, which he sees while he will not follow it ; but even
the philosopher must needs be ' orthodox,' and, since the scrip
tures themselves are self-contradictory, he is obliged to use
his energies not in discovering truth, but in reconciling his
ancestors' dogmas, in order to the creation of a philosophical system which shall agree with everything that has been said in the Vedas and Upanishads. When one sees what subtlety and logical acumen these philosophers possessed, he is moved to wonder what might have been the outcome had their minds been as free as those of more liberal Hellas. But unfortunately they were bound to argue within limits, and were as much handicapped in the race of thought as were they that had to conform to the teachings of Rome. For though India
had no church, it had an inquisitorial priestly caste, and the
unbeliever was an outcast. What is said of custom is true of faith : " Let one walk in the path of good men, the path in which his father walked, in which his grandfathers walked
;
walking in that path one does no wrong" (Manu iv. 178). Real philosophy, unhampered by tradition, is found only among the
heretics and in the sects of a later time.



THE -POPULAR BRAHMANIC FAITH. 267
The gods of old are accepted by the orthodox as a matter of course, altfiough theoretically they are born of the All-god,
who is without the need of ceremonial rites. To the other
castes the active and most terrible deity is represented as being
the priest himself. He not only symbolizes the fire-god, to
whom is offered the sacrifice, but he actually is the divinity in person. Hence there is no greater merit than in giving gifts
to priests. As to eschatology, opinions are not contrasted any
more. They are put side by side. In morality truth, purity, and harmlessness are chiefly inculcated. But the last (ascribed
by some scholars to Buddhistic influence) is not permitted to interfere with animal sacrifices.
Some of the rules for the life of a householder will show in brief the moral excellence and theoretical uncertainty of Manu's law-code. The following extracts are from the fourth, the Ten
Commandments from the sixth, and the description of the hells (twenty-two in all)' from the fourth and twelfth books of Manu's code. These rules may be accepted as a true reflexion of what was taught to- the people by stringent Brahmanism as yet holding aloof from Hinduism. A householder must live without giving any pain (to living creatures). He must perform daily the ceremonies ordained in the Veda. In this way he obtains heaven. Let him never
neglect the offerings to seers, gods, spirits (sprites), men, and
Manes. Some offer sacrifice only in their organs of sense (not
in external offerings) ; some by knowledge alone. Let him
not explain law and rites to the Qudra (slave) caste ; if he does so,, he sinks into the hell Boundless. Let him not take presents from an avaricious king who disobeys the law-codes ; if he does so, he goes to twenty-one hells (called Darkness, Dense

him never despise himself. Let him say what is true and what is agreeable, but not disagreeable truth or agreeable falsehood. Let him not dispute with anybody, but let him say 'very well' Let him not insult anybody. Remembering his former births, and studying the Veda again and again, he gets endless happiness. Let him avoid unbelief and censure of the
Vedas, reviling of gods, hatred, pride, anger, and cruelty. He
that even threatens a priest will go to the hell Darkness for one hundred years ; if he strikes him he will be born in twentyone sinful rebirths (according to another passage in the eleventh book he goes to hell for a thousand years for the
latter offence). Priests rule the world of gods. But deceitful,
hypocritical priests go to hell. Let the householder give gifts, and he will be rewarded. One that gives a . garment gets a place in the moon ; a giver of grain gets eternal happiness ; a giver of the Veda gets union with Brahma {brahma ; these
gifts, of course, are all to priests). He that gives respectfully
and he that receives respectfully go to heaven ; otherwise both
go to hell. Let him, without giving pain to any creature, slowly pile up virtue, as does an_ ant its house, that he may have a companion in the next world. For after death neither
father, nor mother, nor son, nor wife, nor relations are his com
panions ; his virtue alone remains with him. The relations
leave the dead body, but its' virtue follows the spirit ; with his
virtue as his companion he will traverse the darkness that is
hard to cross ; and virtue will lead him to the other world with a luminous form and etherial body. A priest tha.t makes low connections is reborn as a slave. The Father-god permits a priest to accept alms even from a bad man. For fifteen years the Manes refuse to accept food from one that despises a free
gift. A priest that sins should be punished (that is, mulcted,
a priest may not be punished corporally), more than an ordinary man, for the greater the wisdom the greater the offence. They that commit the Five Great Sins live many years in hells,

and afterwards obtain vile births ; the slayer of a priest be
comes in turn a dog, a pig, an ass, a camel, a cow, a goat, a
sheep, etc., etc. A priest that drinks intoxicating liquor be
comes various insects, one after another. A priest that steals
becomes a spider, snake, etc., etc. By repeating sinful acts men are reborn in painful and base births, and are hurled about in hells ; where are sword-leaved trees, etc., and where they are
eaten, burned, spitted, and boiled ; and they receive births
in despicable wombs ; rebirth to age, sorrow, and unquenchable death. But to secure supreme bliss a priest must study the Veda, practice austerity, seek knowledge, subdue the
senses, abstain from injury, and serve his Teacher. Which of these gives highest bliss ? The knowledge of the spirit is the highest and foremost, for it gives immortality. The perform
ance of Vedic ceremonies is the most productive of happiness here and hereafter. The Ten Commandments for the twice-born aYe : Contentment, patience, self-control, not to steal, purity, control of passions, devotion (or wisdom), knowledge,
truthfulness, and freedom from anger. These are concisely summarized again in the follpwing : ' Manu declared the condensed rule of duty for (all) the four castes to be : not to injure
a living thing ; to speak the truth ; not to steal ; to be pure ;
to control the passions' (vi. 92 ; x. 63). The 'non-injury' rule
does not apply, of course, to sacrifice {ib. iii. 268). In the epic the commandments are given sometimes as ten, some
times as eight. In order to give a completed exposition of Brahmanism we have passed beyond the period of the great heresies, to which we must soon revert. But, before leaving the present division of the subject, we select from the mass of Brahmanic domestic
rites, the details of which offer in general little that is worth noting, two or three ceremonies which possess a more human
interest, the marriage rite, the funeral rite, and those strange trials, known among so many other peoples, the ordeals. We



270 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sketch these briefly, wishing merely to illustrate the religious side of each ceremony, as it appears in one or more of its
features.
THE MARRIAGE RITE.
Traces of exogamy may be suspected in the bridegroom's driving off with his bride, but no such custom, of course, is
recognized in the law. On the contrary, the groom is supposed
to belong to the same village, and special rites are enjoined
'if he be from another village.' But again, in the early rule
there is no trace of that taint of family which the totem-scholars
of to-day cite so loosely from Hindu law. The girl is not precluded because she belongs to the same family within certain degrees. The only restriction in the House-rituals is that she
shall have had "on the mother's and father's side" wise, pious, and honorable ancestors for ten generations (A9VI. i. 5). Then
comes the legal restriction, which some scholars call 'primitive,'
that the wife must not be too nearly related. The girl has her own ordeal (not generally mentioned among ordeals !) : The wooer that thus selects his bride (this he does if one has not been found already either by his parents or by his own incli
nation) makes eight balls of earth and calls on the girl to choose
one (' may she get that to which she is born '). If she select a ball made from the earth of a field that bears two crops, she
(or her child) will be rich in grain ; if from the cow-stall, rich
in cattle ; if from the place of sacrifice, godly ; if from a pool
that does not dry, gifted ; if from the gambler's court, devoted
to gambling ; if from cross-roads, unfaithful ; if from a barren
field, poor in grain ; if from the burying-ground, destructful of her husband. There are several forms of making a choice, but we confine ourselves to the marriage.^ In village-life the bride
1 The girl is given or bought, or may make her own choice among different suitors. Buying a wife is reprehended by tlie early law-givers (therefore, customary). The rite of marriage presupposes a grown girl, but child-marriages also were known to the early law.



THE FUNERAL CEREMONY. 271
groom is escorted to the girl's house by young women who tease him. The bridegroom presents presents to the bride, and receives a cow. The bridegroom takes the bride's hand, saying 'I take thy hand for weal' (Rig Veda, x. 85. 36), and leads her to a certain stone, on which she steps first with the right foot (toe). Then three times they circumambulate the fire, keeping it to the right, an old Aryan custom for many rites, as in the deisel of the Kelts ; the bride herself offering grain in the fire, and the groom repeating more Vedic verses. They then take together the seven solemn steps (with verses),^ and so they are married. The groom, if of another village, now drives away with the bride, and has ready Vedic verses for every stage of the journey. After sun-down the groom points out the north star, and admonishes the bride to be no less constant and faithful. Three or twelve days they remain chaste, some say one night ; others say, only if he be from another village. The new husband must now see to the house-fire, which he keeps ever burning, the sign of his being a householder.
THE FUNERAL CEREMONY.
Roth has an article in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (viii. 467) which is at once a description of one of the
funeral hymns of the Rig Veda (x. 18) with the later ritual, and a criticism of the bearing of the latter on the former.^ He shows here that the ritual, so far from having induced the hymn, totally changes it. The hymn was written for a burial ceremony. The later ritual knows only cremation. The ritual,
1 The groom ' releases her from Varuna's fetter,' by symbolically loosening the hair. They step northeast, and he says : ' One step for sap ; two for strength ; three for riches ; four for luck; five for children ; six for the seasons ; seven for friendship. Be true to me ; may we have many long-lived sons.' 2 There is another funeral hymn, x. 16, in which the Fire is invoked to burn the dead, and bear him to the fathers ; his corporeal parts being distributed ' eye to the sun, breath to the wind,' etc.



272 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
therefore, forces the hymn into its service, and makes it a cremation-hymn. This is a very good (though very extreme) example of the difference in age between the early hymns of the
Rig Veda and the more modern ritual. Miiller, ib. ix. p. I (sic),
has given a thorough account of the later ritual and ritualistic
paraphernalia. We confine ourselves here to the older ceremony.
The scene of the Vedic hymn is as follows : The friends and relatives stand about the corpse of a married man. By the side of the corpse sits the widow. The hymn begins: " Depart, O Death, upon some other pathway, upon thy path, which differs from the path of gods . . . harm not our children, nor our heroes. . . . These living ones are separated from the dead ; successful to-day was our call to the gods. (This man is dead, but) we go back to dancing and to laughter, extending
further our still lengthened lives." Then the priest puts a stone between the dead and living: "I set up a wall for the living, may no one of these come to this goal ; may they live an hundred full harvests, and hide death with this stone. . . ." The matrons assembled are now bid to advance without tears, and make their offerings to the fire, while the widow is separated from the corpse of her husband and told to enter again into the world of the living. The priest removes the dead warrior's bow from his hand : " Let the women, not widows, advance with the ointment and holy butter ; and without tears, happy, adorned, let them, to begin with, mount to the altar (verse 7, p. 274, below). Raise thyself, woman, to the world of the living ; his breath is gone by whom thou liest
;
come hither ; of the taker of thy hand (in marriage), of thy
wooer thou art become the wife' (verse 8). I take the bow from the hand of the dead for our (own) lordship, glory, and strength." Then he addresses the dead: "Thou art there, and we are here ; we will slay every foe and every attacker (with
1 See below.



THE FUNERAL CEREMONY. 273
the power got from thee). Go thou now to Mother Earth, who
is wide opened, favorable, a wool-soft maiden to the good man
;
may she guard thee from the lap of destruction. Open, O earth, be not oppressive to him ; let him enter easily ; may he fasten close to thee. Cover him like a mother, who wraps her child in her garment. Roomy and firm be the earth, supported by a thousand pillars ; from this time on thou (man) hast thy home and happiness yonder ; may a sure place remain to him forever. I make firm the earth about thee ; may I not be harmed in laying the clod here ; may the fathers hold this pillar for thee, and Ya'ma make thee a home yonder." In the Atharva Veda mention is made of a coffin, but none
is noticed here. » Hillebrandt {loc. cit. xl. 711) has made it probable that the eighth verse belongs to a still older ritual, according to which this verse is one for human sacrifice, which is here
ignored, though the text is kept."^ Just so the later ritual
keeps all this text, but twists it into a crematory rite. For in the later period only young children are buried. Of burial there was nothing for adults but the collection of bones and
ashes. At this time too the ritual consists of three parts, cre
mation, collection of ashes, expiation. How are these to be
reconciled with this hymn ? Very simply. The rite is described and verses from the hymn are injected into it without
the slightest logical connection. That is the essence of all
the Brahmanic ritualism. The later rite is as follows : Three altars are erected, northwest, southwest, and southeast of a mound of earth. In the fourth corner is the corpse ; at whose feet, the widow. The brother of the dead man, or an old servant, takes the widow's hand and causes her to rise while
the priest says " Raise thyself, woman, to the world of the
1 Compare Weber, Streifen, 1. 66 ; The king's first wife lies with a dead victim, and is bid to come back again to Ufe. Levi rate marriage is known to all the codes, but it is reprehended by the same code that enjoins it. (M. ix. 65.)



274 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
living." Then follows the removal of the bow ; or the break
ing of it, in the case of a slave. The body is now burned, while the priest says " These living ones are separated from the dead"; and the mourners depart without looking around, and must at once perform their ablutions of lustration. After
a time the collection of bones is made with the verse " Go thou now to Mother Earth" and "Open, Dearth." Dust is flung on the bones with the words " Roomy and firm be the earth"; and the skull is laid on top with the verse "I make
firm the earth about thee." In other words the original hymn is fitted to the ritual only by displacement of verses from their proper order and by a forced application of the words. After all this comeS the ceremony of expiation with the use of the
verse " I set up a wall " without application of any sort.
Further ceremonies, with further senseless use of other verses, follow in course of time. These are all explained minutely in the essay of Roth, whose clear demonstration of the modernness of the ritual, as compared with the antiquity of the hymn should be read complete. The seventh verse (above) has a special literature of its own, since the words "let them, to begin with, mount the altar," have been changed by the advocates of suttee, widowburning, to mean 'to the place of fire'; which change, how
ever, is quite recent. The burning of widows begins rather
late in India, and probably was confined at first to the pet wife
of royal persons. It was then claimed as an honor by the first
wife, and eventually without real authority, and in fact against
early law, became the rule and sign of a devoted wife. The practice was abolished by the English in 1829 ; but, consider
ing the widow's present horrible existence, it is questionable whether it would not be a mercy to her and to her family to restore the right of dying and the hope of heaven, in the place of the living death and actual hell on earth in which she is entombed to-day.



ORDEALS. 275
ORDEALS.i
Fire and water are the means employed in India to test
guilt in the earlier period. Then comes the oath with judgment indicated by subsequent misfortune. All other forms of ordeals are first recognized in late law-books. We speak first of the ordeals that have been thought to be primitive Aryan. The Fire-ordeal : (i) Seven fig-leaves are tied seven times upon the hands after rice has been rubbed upon the palms
;
and the judge then lays a red-hot ball upon them; the accused,
or the judge himself, invoking the god (Fire) to indicate the innocence or the guilt of the accused. The latter then walks a certain distance, ' slowly through seven circles, each circle sixteen fingers broad, and the space between the circles being of the same extent,' according to some jurists ; but other dimensions, and eight or nine circles are given by other authorities. If the accused drop the ball he must repeat the test. The burning of the hands indicates guilt. The Teutonic laws give a different measurement, and state that the hand is to be sealed for three days (manus sub sigillo triduum tegatur)
before inspection. This sealing for three days is paralleled by modern Indie practice, but not by ancient law. In Greece
there is thfe simple /xu'Spovs aipetv xepoTi' (Ant. 264) to be compared. The German sealing of the hand is not reported till
the ninth century.^ (2) Walking on Fire : There is no Ordeal in India to correspond to the Teutonic walking over six, nine, or twelve hot ploughshares. To lick a hot ploughshare, to sit on or handle
1 The ordeal is called divyam {pramanani) ' Gottesurtheil.' This means of information is employed especially in a disputed debt and deposit, and according to the formal code is to be applied only in the absence of witnesses. The code also restricts the use of fire, water, and poison to the slaves (Yaj. ii. 98). 2 Kaegi, Alter und HerHtnfi dcs Gervianischcn Goitesttriheils, p. 50. We call especial attention to the fact that the most striking coincidences in details of practice are not early either in India or Germany.



276 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
hot iron, and to take a short walk over coals is late Indie. The German practice also according to Schlagintweit " war
erst in spaterer Zeit aufgekommen." ' (3) Walking through Fire: This is a Teutonic ordeal, and
(like the conflict-ordeal) an Indie custom not formally legalized.
The accused walks directly into the fire. So irvp SiepTrcLv (loc,
cit.).
Water-ordeals: (i) May better be reckoned to fire-ordeals. The innocent plunges his hand into boiling water and fetches out a stone (Anglo-Saxon law) or a coin (Indie law) without
injury to his hand. Sometimes (in both practices) the plunge alone is demanded. The depth to which the hand must be inserted is defined by Hindu jurists.
(2), The Floating-ordeal. The victim is east into water. If
he floats he is guilty; if he drowns he is innocent. According
to some Indie authorities an arrow is shot off at the moment the accused is dropped into the water, and a ' swift runner
'
goes after and fetches it back. " If at his return he find the
body of the accused still under water, the latter shall be declared to be innocent." ^ According to Kaegi this ordeal would appear to be unknown in Europe before the ninth century. In both countries Water (in India, Varuna) is invoked not to keep the body of a guilty man but to reject it (make it
fioat).
Food-ordeal: Some Hindu law-books prescribe that in the case of suspected theft the accused shall eat consecrated rice. If the gums be not hurt, no blood appear on spitting, and the man do not tremble, he will be innocent. This is also a
1 Schlagintweit, Die Gotiesurtheile der Indier, p. 24. 2 This is the earliest formula. Later law-books describe the length and strength of the bow. and some even give the measure of distance to which the arrow must be shot. Two runners, one to go and one to return, are sometimes allowed. There is another water-ordeal "for religious men." The accused is to drink consecrated water. If in fourteen (or more or less) days no calamity happen to him he will be innocent. The same test is made in the case of the oath and of poison (below).



ORDEALS. 277
Teutonic test, but it is to be observed that tlie older laws in India do not mention it.
On the basis of these examples (not chosen in historical sequence) Kaegi has concluded, while admitting that ordeals with a general similarity to these have arisen quite apart
from Aryan influence, that there is here a bit of primitive
Aryan law; and that even the minutiae of the various trials described above are zi!/--Aryan. This we do not believe. But before stating our objections we must mention another ordeal.
The Oath : While fire and water are the usual means of testing crime in India, a simple oath is also permitted, which may involve either the accused alone or his whole family. If
misfortune within a certain time (at once, in seven days, in a
fortnight, or even half a year) happen to the one that has
sworn, he will be guilty. This oath-test is also employed in
the case of witnesses at court, perjury being indicated by the subsequent misfortune (Manu, viii. loS).-' Our objections to seeing primitive Aryan law in the minutiae of ordeals is based on the gradual evolution of these ordeals
and of their minutiae in India itself. The earlier law of the
Sutras barely mentions ordeals; the first 'tradition law' of
Manu has only fire, water, and the oath. All others, and all
special descriptions and restrictions, are mentioned in later
books alone. Moreover, the earliest (pre-legal) notice of ordeals in India describes the carrying of hot iron (in the test of theft) as simply "bearing a hot axe," while still earlier
there is only walking through fire.^
1 In the case of witnesses Manu gives seven days as the limit. When one adopts the oath as an ordeal the misfortune of the guilty is supposed to come ' quickly.' As an ordeal this is not found in the later law. It is one of the Greek tests {loc. cit.). When swearing the Hindu holds water or holy-grass. 2 AV. ii. 12 is not a certain case of this, but it is at least Brahmanic. The carrying of the axe is alluded to in the Chandogya Upanishad (Schlagintweit, Die Gotiesuriheile dcr Indier^ p. 6).



278 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
To the tests by oath, fire, and water of the code of Manu are soon added in later law those of consecrated water, poison,
and the balance. Restrictions increase and new trials are described as one descends the series of law-books (the con
secrated food, the hot-water test, the licking of the plough
share, and the lot). Some of these later forms have already
been described. The further later tests we will now sketch
briefly.
Poison : The earliest poison-test, in the code of Yajnavalkya
(the next after Manu), is an application of aconite-root, and as
the poison is very deadly, the accused is pretty sure to die. Other laws give other poisons and very minute restrictions,
tending to ease the severity of the trial.
The Balance-test : This is the opposite of the floating-test. The man ^ stands in one scale and is placed in equilibrium with a weight of stone in the other scale. He then gets out
and prays, and gets in again. If the balance sinks, he is
guilty ; if it rises, he is innocent.
The Lot-ordeal : This consists in drawing out of a vessel one of two lots, equivalent respectively to dharma and adharma, right and wrong. Although Tacitus mentions the same ordeal among the Germans, it is not early Indie law, not being known to any of the ancient legal codes. One may claim without proof or disproof that these are all ' primitive Aryan ' ; but to us it appears most probable that
only the idea of the ordeal, or at most its application in the simplest forms of water and fire (and perhaps oath) is primi
tive Aryan, and that all else (including ordeal by conflict) is of secondary growth among the different nations.
As an offset to the later Indie tendency to lighten the severity of the ordeal may be mentioned the description of the
floating-test as seen by a Chinese traveller in India in the
1 Yajnavalkya {loc. cit^ restricts this test to women, cliildren, priests, tlie old, blind, lame, and sick. On phdla for agni, idA\. gg, see ZDMG. ix. byy.



ORDEALS. 279
seventh century a.d. : ^ " The accused is put into a sack and a stone is put into another sack. The two sacks are connected
by a cord and flung into deep water. If the sack with the
man sinks and the sack with the stone floats the accused is declared to be innocent."
1 Schlagintweit, loc. cii. p. 26 (Hiouen Thsang).



CHAPTER XII.
JAINISM.i
One cannot read the Upanishads without feeling that he is
already facing an intellectual revolt. Not only in the later
tracts, which are inspired with devotion to a supreme and uni^
versal Lord, but even in the oldest of these works the atmos
phere, as compared with that of the earlier Brahmanic period, is
essentially different. The close and stifling air of ritualism
has been charged with an electrical current of thought that must soon produce a storm. That storm reached a head in Buddhism, but its premonitory signs appear in the Upanishads, and its first outbreak preceded the advent of Gautama. Were it possible to draw a line of demarcation between the Upanishads that come before and after Buddhism, it would be historically more correct to review the two great schisms, Jainism and Buddhism, before referring
to the sectarian Upanishads. For these latter in their present
form are posterior to the rise of the two great heresies. But,
since such a division is practically uncertain in its application, we have thought it better in our sketch of the Upanishads and
legal literature to follow to the end the course of that agitated
thought, which, starting with the great identification oijiva, the
1 We retain here and in Buddhism the usual terminology. Strictly speaking, Jainism is to Jina (the reformer's title) as is Bauddhism to Buddha, so that one should say Jinism, Buddhism, or Jainism, Bauddhism. Both titles, Jina and Buddha ('victor' and 'awakened'), were given to each leader; as in general many other mutual titles of honor were applied by each sect to its own head, Jina, Arhat (* venerable'), Mahavira ('great hero'), Buddha, etc. One of these titles was used, however, as a title of honor by the Jains, but to designate heretics by the Buddhists, viz., Tirthakara, 'prophet' (see Jacobi, SBE. xxii. Introd. p. xx).



JAINISM. 281
individual spirit, and atma, the world-spirit, the All, continues
till it loses itself in a multiplication of sectarian dogmas, where the All becomes the god that has been elected by one communion of devotees.^
The external characteristics of Upanishad thought are those of a religion that has replaced formal acts by formal introspection. The Yogin devotee, who by mystic communion desires absorption into the world-spirit, replaces the Sannyasin and Yati ascetics, who would accomplish the same end by renunci
ation and severe self-mortification. This is a fresh figure on the stage of thought, where before were mad Munis, beggars, and miracle-mongers. On this stage stands beside the ascetic the theoretical theosophist who has succeeded in identifying himself, soberly, not in frenzy, with God.^ What were the
practical results of this teaching has been indicated in part
already. The futility of the stereotyped religious offices was recognized. But these offices could not be discarded by the orthodox. With the lame and illogical excuse that they were
useful as discipline, though unessential in reality, they were
retained by the Brahman priest. Not so by the Jain ; still less so by the Buddhist. In the era in which arose the public revolt against the dogmatic teaching of the Brahman there were more sects than one that have now passed away forgotten. The eastern part of India, to which appertain the later part of the Qatapatha Brah
mana and the schismatic heresies, was full of religious and
philosophical controversy. The great heretics were not inno-l vators in heresy. The Brahmans permitted, encouraged, and' shared in theoretical controversy. There was nothing in the
1 It is possible, however, on the other hand, that both Vishnuite and Qivaite sects (or, less anglicized, Vaishnavas, Qaivas, if one will also say Vaidic for Vedic), were formed Ijefore the end of the sixth century B.C. Not long after this the divinities Civa and Vishnu receive especial honor. 2 The Beggar ((Jramana, Bhikshu), the Renunciator (Sannyasin), the Ascetic (Yati), are Brahmanic terms as well as sectarian.



282 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
tenets of Jainism or of Buddhism that from a philosophical point of view need have caused a rupture with the Brahmans.
But the heresies, nevertheless, do not represent the priestly
caste, so much as the caste most apt to rival and to disregard the claim of the Brahman, viz., the warrior-caste. They were
supported by kings, who gladly stood against priests. To a great extent both Jainism a'nd Buddhism owed their success (amid other rival heresies with no less claim to good protest
antism) to the politics of the day. The kings of the East were impatient of the Western church ; they were pleased to throw it over. The leaders in the ' reformation ' were the younger sons of noble blood. The church received many of these younger sons as priests. Both Buddha and Mahavira were, in fact, revolting adherents of the Brahmanic faith, but they were princes and had royalty to back them. Nor in the Brahmanhood of Benares was Brahmanhood at its strongest. The seat of the Vedic cult lay to the westward,
where it arose, in the 'holy land,' which received the Vedic Aryans after they had crossed out of the Punjab. With the eastward course of conquest the character of the people and the very orthodoxy of the priests were relaxed. The country
that gave rise to the first heresies was one not consecrated to the ancient rites. Very slowly had these rites marched thither, and they were, so to speak, far from their religious base of supplies. The West was more conservative than the East. It was the home of the rites it favored. The East was but a
foster-father. New tribes, new land, ngw growth, socially and
intellectually, — all these contributed in the new seat of Brah
manhood to weaken the hold of the priests upon their specu
lative and now recalcitrant laity. So before Buddha there were heretics and even Buddhas, for the title was Buddha's only by adoption. But of most of these earlier sects one knows little. Three or four names of reformers have been handed down ; half a dozen opponents or rivals of Buddha existed and vied



JAINISM. 283
with him. Most important of these, both on account of his probable priority and because of the lasting character of his school, was the founder or reformer of Jainism, Mahavira Jfiatriputra/ who with his eleven chief disciples may be regarded as the first open seceders from Brahmanism, unless one assign the same date to the revolt of Buddha. The two schisms have
so much in common, especially in outward features, that for long it was thought that Jainism was a sub-sect of Buddhism. In their legends, in the localities in which they flourished, and in many minutiae of observances they are alike. Nevertheless, their differences are as great as the resemblance between them, and what Jainism at first appeared to have got of Buddhism seems now to be rather the common loan made by each sect from Brahmanism. It is safest, perhaps, to rest in the assurance that the two heresies were contemporaries of the sixth century B.C., and leave unanswered the question which Master preceded the othqr, though we incline to the opinion that the founder of Jainism, be he Mahavira or his own reputed master, Pargvanatha, had founded his sect before Gautama became Buddha. But there is one good reason for treating of Jainism before Buddhism,^ and that is, that the former represents a theological mean between Brahmanism and Buddhism. Mahavira, the reputed founder of his sect, was, like Buddha
1 The three great reformers of this period are Mahavira, Buddha, and Gosala. The last was first a pupil and then a rival of Mahavira. The latter's nephew, Jamali, also founded a distinct sect and became his uncle's opponent, the speculative sectarian tendency being as pronounced as it was about the same time in Hellas. Gosala appears to have had quite a following, and his sect e.xisted for a long time, but now it is utterly perished. An account of this reformer and of Jamali will be found in Leumann's essay, Indische Stiidien, xvii. p. 98 ff. and in the appendix to Rockhill's Life of Buddha. 2 The Nirgranthas (Jains) are never referred to by the Buddhists as being a new sect, nor is their reputed founder, Nataputta, spoken of as their founder ; whence Jacobi plausibly argues that their real founder was older than Mahavira, and that the sect preceded that of Buddha. Lassen and Weber have claimed, on the contrary, that Jainism is a revolt against Buddhism. The identification of Nataputta (Jiiatri. piitra) with Mahavira is due to Biihler and Jacobi (Kalpasutra, Introd. p. 6).



2S4 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
and perhaps his other rivals, of aristocratic birth. His father
is called king, but he was probably hereditary chief of a district incorporated as a suburb of the capital city of Videha, while by marriage he was related to the king of Videha, and to the ruling house of Magadha. His family name was Jiiatri
putra, or, in his own Prakrit (Ardhamagadhi) dialect, Nataputta ; but by his sect he was entitled the Great Hero, Mahavira ; the Conqueror, Jina ; the Great One, Vardahmana, etc. His sect was that of the Nirgranthas (Nigganthas), i.e., ' without bonds,' perhaps the oldest name of the whole body. Later there are found no less than seven sub-sects, to which come as eighth the Digambaras, in contradistinction to all the seven Cvetambara sects. These two names represent the two present bodies of the church, one body being the Q^vetambaras, or
' white-attire ' faction, who are in the north and west ; the
other, the Digambaras, or ' sky-attire,' i.e., naked devotees of the south. The latter split off from the main body about two hundred years after Mahavira's death ; as has been thought by some, because the ^vetambaras refused to follow the Di
gambaras in insisting upon nakedness as the rule for ascetics.* The earlier writings show that nakedness was recommended, but was not compulsory.^ Other designations of the main
sects, as of the sub-sects, are found. Thus, from the practice
of pulling out the hairs of their body, the Jains were derisively
termed Luiicitakegas, or ' hair-pluckers.' The naked devotees
1 According to Jacobi, ZDMG. xxxvui. 1 7, the split in the party arose in this way. About 350 B.C. some Jain monks under the leadership of Bhadrabahu went south, and they followed stricter rules of asceticism than did their fellows in the north. Both sects are modifications of the original type, and their differences did not result in sectarian separation till about the time of our era, at which epoch arose the differentiating titles of sects that had not previously separated into formal divisions, but had drifted apart geographically. 2 Compare Jacobi, loc. cit., and Leumann's account of the seven sects of the (^vetambaras in the essay in the Indische Studien referred to above. At the present day the Jains are found to the number of about a million in the northwest (Qvetambaras), and «outh (Digambaras) of India. The original seat of the whole body in its first form was, as we have said, near Benares, where also arose and flourished Buddhism.

of this school are probably the gymnosophists of the Greek historians, although this general term may have been used in describing other sects, as the practice of dispensing with attire is common even to-day with many Hindu devotees.'
An account of the Jain absurdities in the way of speculation
would indeed give some idea of their intellectual frailty,
but, as in the case of the Buddhists, such an account has but
little to do with their religion. It will suffice to state that the ' ages ' of the Brahmans from whom Jain and Buddhist derived their general conceptions of the ages, are here reckoned quite
differently ; and that the first Jina of the long series of prehistoric prophets lived more than eight million years and was five hundred bow-lengths in height. Monks and laymen now
appear at large in India, a division which originated neither with Jain nor Buddhist,^ though these orders are more clearly divided among the heretics, from whom, again, was borrowed
by the Hindu sects, the monastic institution, in the ninth century (a.d.), in all the older heretical completeness. Although atheistic the Jain worshipped the Teacher, and paid some regfird to the Brahmanical divinities, just as he worships the Hindu gods to-day, for the atheistical systems admitted gods as demi-gods or dummy gods, and in point of fact became very superstitious. Yet are both founder-worship and super
stition rather the growth of later generations than the original
practice. The atheism of the Jain means denial of a divine
creative Spirit."
1 Hemacandra's Yogagastra, edited by Windisch, ZDMG. xxviii. 1S5 ff. (iii. 133). The Jain's iiate of women did not prevent his worshipping goddesses as the female energy like the later Hindu sects. The Jains are divided in regard to the possibility of woman's salvation. The Yogajastra alludes to women as ' the lamps that burn on the road that leads to the gate of hell,' ii. 87. The Digambaras do not admit women into the order, as do the Qvetambaras. 2 Die Bharata-sage, Leumann, ZDMG. xlviii. p. 65. See also above in the Siitras. With the Jains there is less of the monastic side of religion than with the Buddhists. 3 Jains are sometimes called Arhats on account of their veneration for the Arhat or chief Jina (whence Jain). Their only real gods are their chiefs or Teacheis, whose

Though at times in conflict with the Brahmans the Jains never departed from India as did the Buddhists, and even Brahmanic priests in some parts of India serve to-day in Jain
temples.
In metaphysics as in reHgion the Jain differs radically from the Buddhist. He believes in a dualism not unlike that of the Sankhyas, whereas Buddhistic philosophy has no close connection with this Brahmanic system. To the Jain eternal matter stands opposed to eternal spirits, for (opposed to pantheism) every material entity (even water) has its own individual spirit. The Jain's Nirvana, as Barth has said, is escape from the body, not escape from existence.^ Like the Buddhist the
Jain believes in reincarnation, eight births, after one has started on the right road, being necessary to the completion of perfection. Both sects, with the Brahmans, insist on the noninjury doctrine, but in this regard the Jain exceeds his Brah
manical teacher's practice. Both heretical sects claim that
their reputed founders were the last of twenty-four or twentyfive prophets who preceded the real founder, each successively having become less monstrous (more human) in form.
The Jain literature left to us is quite large ^ and enough has been published already to make it necessary to revise the old belief in regard to the relation between Jainism and Buddhism.
We have said that Jainism stands nearer to Brahmanism (with which, however, it frequently had quarrels) than does
idols are v^^orshipped in the temples. Thus, like the Buddhist and some Hindu sects of modern times, they have given up God to worship man. Rather have they adopted an idolatry of man and worship of womanhood, for they also revere the female energy. Positivism has ancient models
!
1 The Jain sub-sects did not differ much among themselves in philosophical speculation. Their differences were rather of a practical sort. 2 See the list of the BerUn MSS.; Weber, Berlin MSS. vol. ii. 1892; and the thirty-third volume of the German Oriental Journal, pp. 478, 693. For an account of the literature see also Jacobi's introduction to the SBE. vol. xxii; and Weber, Ueber die heiligcn Schriftcn der Jaina in vols, xvi, xvii of the Indischc Stttdien (translated by Smyth in the Indian Antiquary) ; and the Bibliography (below).



JAINISM. 287
Buddhism.^ The most striking outward sign of this is the weight laid on asceticism, which is common to Brahmanism and Jainism but is repudiated by Buddhism. Twelve years of asceti
cism are necessary to salvation, as thinks the Jain, and this
self-mortification is of the most stringent sort. But it is not in
their different conception of a Nirvana of release rather than
of annihilation, nor in the Sankhya-like ^ duality they affect,
nor yet in the prominence given to self-mortification that the Jains differ most from the Buddhists. The contrast will appear more clearly when we come to deal with the latter sect. At present we take up the Jain doctrine for itself.
The ' three gems ' which, according to the Jains,' result in the spirit's attainment of deliverance are knowledge, faith, and
virtue, or literally ' right knowledge, right intuition, and right
practices.' Right knowledge is a true knowledge of the rela
tion of spirit and non-spirit (the world consists of two classes,
spirit and non-spirit), the latter being immortal like the former. ^Right intuition is absolute faith in the word of the Master and
the declarations of the Agamas, or sacred texts. Right prac
tices or virtue consists, according to the Yogagastra, in the
correct fivefold conduct of one that has knowledge and faith
:
(i) Non-injury, (2) kindness aftd speaking what is true (in so
far as the truth is pleasant to the hearer),'' (3) honorable con
duct, typified by ' not stealing,' (4) chastity in word, thought,
and deed, (5) renunciation of earthly interests. The doctrine of non-injury found but modified approval
among the Brahmans. They limited its application in the case of
i A case of connection in legends between Buddhist and Jain is mentioned below. Another is the history of Icing PaSsi, elaborated in Buddhistic literature (Tripitaka) and in the second Jain Upanga alike, as has been shown by Leumann. '^ The Jain's spirit, however, is not a world-spirit. He does not believe in an All-Spirit, but in a plurality of eternal spirits, fire-spirits, wind-spirits, plantspirits, etc. 3 Compare Colebrooke's Essays, vol, ii. pp. 404, 444, and the Yoga5astra cited above. ^ This is n9t in the earlier form of the vow (see below).



288 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sacrifice, and for this reason were bitterly taunted by the Jains
as ' murderers.' " Viler than unbelievers,'' says the Yogagastra,
quoting a law of Manu to the effect that animals may be slain
for sacrifice, " are those cruel ones who make the law that
teaches killing." ^ For this reason the Jain is far more partic
ular in his respect for life than is the Buddhist. Lest animate
things, even plants and animalculae, be destroyed, he sweeps
the ground before him as he goes, walks -veiled lest he inhale
a living organism, strains water, and rejects not only meat but even honey, together with various fruits that are supposed to
contain worms ; not because of his distaste for worms but because of his regard for life. Other arguments which, logically, should not be allowed to influence him are admitted, how
ever, in order to terrify the hearer. Thus the first argument
against the use of honey is that it destroys life ; then follows the argument that honey is 'spit out by bees ' and therefore it
is nasty.^
The Jain differs from the Buddhist still more in ascetic
practices. He is a forerunner, in fact, of the horrible modern devotee whose practices we shall describe below. The older view of seven hells in opposition to the legal Brahmanic number of thrice seven is found ' (as it is in the Markandeya Purana), but whether this be the rule we cannot say.^ It is interesting to see that hell is preserved with metempsychosis exactly as it is among the Brahraans.^ Reincarnation on
1 ii. 37 and 41. Although the Brahman ascetic took the vow not to kill, yet is he permitted to do so for sacrifice, and he may eat flesh of animals killed by other animals (Gautama, 3. 31). 2 Loc. cit. iii. 37-3S. The evening and night are not times to eat, and for the same reason " The Gods eat in the morning, the Seers at noon, the Fathers in the afternoon, the devils at twilight and night" {ib. 58). For at night one might eat a a living thing by mistake. 8 x^oc. cit. ii. 27. 4 The pun mamsa^ " Me eat will be hereafter whose nteat I eat in this life " (Lanman), shows that Jain and Brahman believed in a hell where the injured avenged themselves (Manu, v. 55 ; HYQ. iii. 26), just as is related in the Bhrigu story (above).



JAINISM. 289
earth and punishment in hells between reincarnation seems to
be the usual belief. The salvation which is attained by the
practice of knowledge, faith, and five-fold virtue, is not imme
diate, but it will come after successive reincarnations ; and
this salvation is the freeing of the eternal spirit from the bonds
of eternal matter ; in other words, it is much more like the
' release ' of the Brahman than it is like the Buddhistic
Nirvana, though, of course, there is no ' absorption,' each spirit
remaining single. In the order of the Ratnatraya or ' three gems ' Cankara appears to lay the greatest weight on faith, but in Hemacandra's schedule knowledge ^ holds the first place.
This is part of that Yoga, asceticism, which is the most im
portant element in attaining salvation.^
Another division of right practices is cited by the Yogagastra
(i. 33 ff.) : Some saints say that virtue is divided into five kinds
of care and three kinds of control, to wit, proper care in walk
ing, talking, begging for food, sitting, and performing natural
functions of the body — these constitute the five kinds of care, and the kinds of control are those of thought, speech, and act.
This teaching it is stated, is for the monks. The practice of the
laity is to accord with the custom of their country.
The chief general rules for the laity consist in vows of obe
dience to the true god, to the law, and to the (present) Teacher ; which are somewhat like the vows of the Buddhist. God here is the Arhat, the 'venerable' founder of the sect. The laic has
also five lesser vows : not to kill, not to lie, not to steal, not to
commit adultery or fornication, to be content with little. According to the Qastra already cited the laic must rise early in the morning, worship the god's idol at home, go to the
temple and circumambulate the Jina idol three times, strewing flowers, and singing hymns, and then read the Pratyakhyana (an old Purva, gospel).^ Further rules of prayer and practice
1 By intuition or instruction, 2 l^oc. cit. i. 15 ff. 3 Loc. cit. iii. 1 21 ff. Wilson, Essays, 1. 3 19, gives a description of the simple Jain rituaL

guide him through his day. And by following this rule he expects to obtain spiritual ' freedom ' hereafter ; but for his life
on earth he is "without praise or blame for this world or the
next, for life or for death, having meditation as his one pure wife " (iii. 150). He will become a god in heaven, be reborn again on earth, and so, after eight successive existences (the Buddhistic number), at last obtain salvation, release (from
bodies) for his eternal soul (153).
As in the Upanishads, the gods, like men, are a part of the system of the universe. The wise man goes to them (becomes
a god) only to return to earth again. All systems thus unite
hell and heaven with the karma doctrine. But in this Jain work, as in so many of the orthodox writings, the weight is laid more on hell as a punishment than on rebirth. Probably the first Jains did not acknowledge gods at all, for it is an early rule with them not to say ' God rains,' or use any such expression, but to say 'the cloud rains '; and in other ways they avoid to employ a terminology which admits even implicitly the existence of divinities. Yet do they use a god not infrequently as an agent of gloriiication of Mahavira, saying in later writings that Indra transformed himself, to do the Teacher honor ; and often they speak of the gods and goddesses as if these were regarded as spirits. Demons and inferior beings are also utilized in the same way, as when 'it is said that at the Teacher's birth the demons (spirits) showered gold upon the town. The religious orders of the Qlvetambara sect contained nuns as well as monks, although, as we have said, women are not esteemed very favorably : " The world is greatly troubled by women. People say that women are vessels of pleasure. But
this leads them to pain, to delusion, to death, to hell, to
birth as hell-beings or brute-beasts." Such is the decision in the Acaranga Sutra, or book of usages for the Jain monk and nun. From the same work we extract a few rules to illustrate



JAINISM. 291
the practices of the Jains. This literature is the most tedious
in the world, and to give the gist of the heretic law-maker's
manual will suffice. Asceticism should be practiced by monk and nun, if possible.
But if one finds that he cannot resist his passions, or is disabled and cannot endure austerities, he may commit suicide; although this release is sometimes reprehended, and is not
allowable till one has striven against yielding to such a means. But when the twelve years of asceticism are passed one has assurance of reaching Nirvana, and so may kill himself. Of
Nirvana there is no description. It is release, salvation, but
it is of such sort that in regard to it 'speculation has no place,' and ' the mind cannot conceive of it ' (copied from the
Upanishads). In other regards, in contrast to the nihilistic
Buddhist, the Jain assumes a doubtful attitude, so that he is termed the 'may-be philosopher,' jya^fz'i?;//;?,'' in opposition to the Buddhist, the philosopher of ' the void.'
But if the Jain may kill himself, he may not kill or injure anything else. Not even food prepared over a fire is accept
able, lest he hurt the 'fire-beings,' for as he believes in
water-beings, so he believes in fire-beings, wind-beings, etc. Every plant and seed is holy with the sacredness of life. He may not hurt or drive away the insects that torment his naked
flesh. ' Patience is the highest good,' he declares, and the rules for sitting and lying conclude with the statement that
not to move at all, not to stir, is the best rule. To lie naked,
bitten by vermin, and not to disturb them, is religion. Like
a true Puritan, the Jain regards pleasure in itself as sinful.
" What is discontent, and what is pleasure ? One should live
subject to neither. Giving up all gaiety, circumspect, restrained,
one should lead a religious life. Man ! Thou art thine own friend; why longest thou for a friend beyond thyself? . . .
First troubles, then pleasures ; first pleasures, then troubles.
1 Who says " may be."



292 THE RELIGIONS OF IiVDIA.
These are the cause of quarrels." And again, " Let one think, ' I am I,' " i.e., let one be dependent on himself alone. When
a Jain monk or nun hears that there is to be a festival (perhaps to the gods, to Indra, Skanda, Rudra, Vishnu,^ or the demons, as in Acaranga Sutra, ii. 1.2) he -must not go thither
;
he must keep himself from all frivolities and entertainments. During the four months of the rainy season he is to remain in
one place,^ but at other times, either naked or attired in a few garments, he is to wander about begging. In going on his begging tour he is not to answer questions, nor to retort if
reviled. He is to speak politely (the formulae for polite address and rude address are given), beg modestly, and not render himself liable to suspicion on account of his behavior when in the house of one of the faithful. Whatever be the
quality of the food he must eat it, if it be not a wrong sort. Rice and beans are especially recommended to him. The great Teacher Jiiatriputra (Mahavira), it is said, never went to shows, pantomines, boxing-matches, and the like ; but, remain
ing in his parents' house till their death, that he might not grieve his mother, at the age of twenty-eight renounced the world with the consent of the government, and betook himself
to asceticism ; travelling naked (after a year of clothes) into barbarous lands, but always converting and enduring the reproach of the wicked. He was beaten and set upon by sinful men, yet was he never moved to anger. Thus it was that he became the Arhat, the Jina, the Kevalin (perfect sage).^ It
1 Mukunda. 2 This ' keeping vasso ' is also a Brahmanic custom, as Biihler has pointed out. But it is said somewhere that at that season the roads are impassible, so that there is not so much a conscious copying as a physical necessity in keeping vasso; perhaps also a moral touch, owing to the increase of life and danger of killing, 3 In the lives of the Jinas it is said that Jiiatriputra's (Nataputta's) parents worshipped the 'people's favorite,' Pargva, and were followers of the (Jramanas (ascetics). In the same work (which contains nothing further for our purpose) it is said that ArhatSj Cakravarts, Baladevas, and Vasudevas, present, past, and future, are aristocrats, born in noble families. The heresies and sectaries certainly claim as much.



JAINISM. 293
is sad to have to add, however, that Mahavira is traditionally
said to have died in a fit of apoplectic rage.
The equipment of a monk are his clothes (or, better, none), his alms-bowl, broom, and veil. He is ' unfettered,' in being
without desires and without injury to others. ' Some say that
all sorts of living beings may be slain, or abused, or tormented,
or driven away — the doctrine of the unworthy. The righteous man does not kill hor cause others to kill. He should not cause the same punishment for himself.' The last clause is significant. What he does to another
living being will be done to him. He will suffer as he has
caused others to suffer. The chain from emotion to hell
•
the avoidance of the former is on account of the fear of the
latter — is thus connected : He who knows wrath knows pride ; he who knows pride knows deceit ; he who knows deceit knows greed (and so on ; thus one advances) from greed to love, from love to hate, from hate to delusion, from delusion to conception, from conception to birth, from birth to death, from death
to hell, from hell to animal existence, ' and he who knows animal existence knows pain.' The five great vows, which have been thought by some scholars to be copies of the Buddhistic rules, whereas they are really modifications of the old Brahmanic rules for
ascetics as explained in pre-Buddhistic literature, are in detail
as follows :
^
The First vow : I renounce all killing of living beings, whether subtile or gross, whether movable or immovable. Nor shall I myself kill living beings nor cause others to do it, nor consent to it. As long as I live I confess and blame, repent and exempt
myself of these sins in the thrice threefold way,^ in mind, speech,
and body.
1 Acaranga S. ii. 15. We give Jacobi's translation, as in the verses already cited from this work. 2 Acting, commanding, consenting, past, present, or future (Jacobi).



294 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The five 'clauses' that explain this vow are: (i) the
Niggantha (Jain) is careful in walking ; (2) he does not allow his mind to act in a way to suggest injury of living beings ;
(3) he does not allow his speech to incite to injury ; (4) he is
careful in laying down his utensils ; (5) he inspects his food
and drink lest he hurt living beings. The Second Vow : I renounce all vices of lying speech aris
ing from anger, or greed, or fear, or mirth. I confess (etc., as
in the first vow).
The five clauses here explain that the Niggantha speaks only after deliberation ; does not get angry ; renounces greed ;
renounces fear; renounces mirth — lest through any of these he be moved to lie. The Third Vow : I renounce all taking of anything not given, either in a village, or a town, or a wood, either of little
or much, or small or great, of living or lifeless things. I shall neither take myself what is not given nor cause others to take it, nor consent to their taking it. As long as I live I confess
(etc., as in the first vow).
The clauses here explain that the Niggantha must avoid
different possibilities of stealing, such as taking food without
permission of his superior. One clause states that he may take
only a limited ground for a limited time, i.e., he may not settle down indefinitely on a wide area, for he may not hold land absolutely. Another clause insists on his having his grant to the land renewed frequently.
The Fourth Vow : I renounce all sexual pleasures, either with gods, or men, or animals. I shall not give way to sensu
ality (etc.).
The clauses here forbid the Niggantha to discuss topics relating to women, to contemplate the forms of women, jto recall the pleasures and amusements he used to have with women, to eat and drink too highly seasoned viands, to lie near women.



JAINISM. 295
The Fifth Vow : I renounce all attachments, whether little
or much, small or great, living or lifeless ; neither shall I my
self form such attachments, nor cause others to do so, nor
consent to their doing so (etc.).
The five clauses particularize the dangerous attachments
formed by ears, eyes, smell, taste, touch.
It has been shown above (following Jacobi's telling comparison of the heretical vows with those of the early Brahman ascetic) that these vows are taken not from Buddhism but from
Brahmanism. Jacobi opines that the Jains took the four first and that the reformer Mahavira added the fifth as an offset to the Brahmanical vow of liberality.-' The same writer shows
that certain minor rules of the Jain sect are derived from the same Brahmanical source. The main differences between the two Jain sects have been catalogued in an interesting sketch by Williams,'' who mentions
as the chief Jain stations of the north Delhi (where there is an annual gathering), Jeypur, and Ajmir. To these Mathura on the Jumna should be added.^ The Qvetambaras had forty-five or forty-six Agamas, eleven or twelve Angas, twelve Upangas,
and other scriptures of the third or fourth century B.C., as they
claim. They do not go naked (even their idols are clothed), and they admit women into the order. The Digambaras do not admit women, go naked, and have for sacred texts later
works of the fifth century a.d. The latter of course assert that the scriptures of the former sect are spurious.*
1 SBE. xxii. Introd. p, xxiv. 2 JRAS. XX. 279. 3 See Biihler, the last volume of the Bfigraphica Indica, and his other articles in the WZKM. V. 59, 175. Jeypur, according to WilUams, is the stronghold of the Digambara Jains. Compare Thomas, JRAS. ix. 155, Early Faith of A^oka. * The redaction of the Jain canon took place, according to tradition, in 454 or 467 A.D. (possibly 527). "The origin of the extant Jaina literature cannot be placed earlier than about 300 b,c." (Jacobi, Introduction to Jain Siiiras, pp. xxxvii, xliii). The present Angas (' divisions ') were preceded by Purvas, of which there are said to have been at first fourteen. On the number of the scriptures see Weber, loc. at.



296 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
In distinction from the Buddhists the Jains of to-day keep up caste. Some of them are Brahmans. They have, of course, a different prayer-formula, and have no Stupas or Dagobas (to
hold relics); and, besides the metaphysical difference spoken of above, they differ from the Buddhists in assuming that metempsychosis does not stop at animal existence, but includes inanimate things (as these are regarded by others). According to one of their own sect of to-day, ahimsa paramo dharmas,'the:
highest law of duty is not to hurt a living creature.' ^ The most striking absurdity of the Jain reverence for life has frequently been commented upon. Almost every city of western India, where they are found, has its beast-hospital, where animals are kept and fed. An amusing account of such an
hospital, called Pinjra Pol, at Saurarashtra, Surat, is given in
the first nimaber of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society!^ Five thousand rats were supported in such a temple-hospital in Kutch.'
Of all the great religious sects of India that of Nataputta is
perhaps the least interesting, and has apparently the least ex
cuse for being.* The Jains offered to the world but one great moral truth, withal a negative truth, ' not to harm,' nor was this verity invented by them. Indeed, what to the Jain is the great truth is only a grotesque exaggeration of what other sects recognized in a reasonable form. Of all the sects the Jains are the most colorless, the most insipid. They have
1 Williams, loc. cit. The prayer-formula is :
' Reverence to Arhats, saints, teachers, sul>teacher5, and all good men.' 2
* A place which is appropriated for the reception of old, worn-out^ lame, or disabled animals. At that time (1823) they chiefly consisted of buffaloes and cows, but there were also goats and sheep, and even cocks and hens,' and also ' hosts of vermin.' 3 JRAS. 1S34, p. 96. The town was taxed to provide the food for the rats. * Because the Jains have reverted to idolatry, demonology, and man-worship. But at the outset they appear to have had two great principles, one, that '1:here is no divine power higher than man ; the other, that all life is sacred. One of these is now practically given up, and the other was always taken too seriously.



JAINISM. 297
no literature worthy of the name. They were not original enough to give up many orthodox features, so that they seem like a weakened rill of Brahmanism, cut off from the source, yet devoid of all independent character. A religion in which the chief points insisted upon are that one should deny God, worship man, and nourish vermin, has indeed no right to exist
;
nor has it had as a system much influence on the history of thought. As in the case of Buddhism, the refined Jain metaphysics are probably a late growth. Historically these sectaries
served a purpose as early protestants against ritualistic and
polytheistic Brahmanism ; but their real affinity with the latter
faith is so great that at heart they soon became Brahmanic again. Their position geographically would make it seem probable that they, and not the Buddhists, had a hand in the
making of the ethics of the later epic.



CHAPTER XIII.
BUDDHISM.
While the pantheistic believer proceeded to anthropomorphize in a still greater degree the atma of his fathers, and eventually landed in heretical sectarianism; while the orthodox Brahman simply added to his pantheon (in Manu and other law-codes) the Brahmanic figure of the Creator, Brahma ; the
truth-seeker that followed the lines of the earlier philosophical thought arrived at atheism, and in consequence became either
stoic or hedonist. The latter school, the Carvakas, the so
called disciples of Brihaspati, have, indeed, a philosophy without religion. They simply say that the gods do not exist, the priests are hypocrites ; the Vedas, humbug ; and the only thing worth living for, in view of the fact that there are no gods, no heaven,
and no soul, is pleasure : ' While life remains let a man live happily ; let him not go without butter (literally ghee) even though he run into debt,' etc.^ Of sterner stuff was the man
who invented a new religion as a solace for sorrow and a refuge
from the nihilism in which he believed. Whether Jainism or Buddhism be the older heresy, and it is not probable that any definitive answer to this question will
ever be given, one thing has become clear in the light of recent studies, namely, the fact already shown, that to Brahmanism are due some of the most marked traits of both the heretical sects. The founder of Buddhism did not strike out a new system of morals ; he was not a democrat ; he did not originate a plot to overthrow the Brahmanic priesthood ; he

did not invent tlie order of monks.^ Tliere is, perhaps, no person in history in regard to whom have arisen so many
opinions that are either wholly false or half false. '^ We shall not canvass in detail views that would be mentioned
only to be rejected. Even the brilliant study of Senart,^ in which the figure of Buddha is resolved into a solar type and the history of the reformer becomes a sun-myth, deserves only to be mentioned and kid aside. Since the publication of the canonical books of the southern Buddhists there is no longer any question in regard to the human reality of the great knight who illumined, albeit with anything but heavenly light, the darkness of Brahmanical belief. Oldenberg * has taken Senart seriously, and seriously answered him. But Napoleon and Max Miiller have each been treated as sun-myths, and Senart's
essay is as convincing as either /!?« d^ esprit.
In Nepal, far from the site of Vedic culture, and generations after the period of the Vedic hymns, was born a son to the noble family of the Qakyas. A warrior prince, he made at last exclusively his own the lofty title that was craved by many of
his p3ers, Buddha, the truly wise, the 'Awakened.' The Qakyas' land extended along the southern border of Nepal and the northeast part of Oude (Oudh), between the Iravati (Rapti) river on the west and south, and the Rohini on thi east ; the district which lies around the present Gorakhpur, about one hundred miles north-northeast of Benares, The p3rsonal history of the later Buddha is interwoven with legend from which it is not always easy to disentangle the threads of trutli. In the accounts preserved in regard to the Master, one
has first to distinguish the Pali records of the Southern Buddhists from the Sanskrit tales of the Northerners ; and again, it is necessary to discriminate between the earlier and

later traditions of the Southerners,' who have kept in general
the older history as compared with the extravagant tradition preserved in the Lalita Vistara, the Lotus of the Law, and the other works of the North. What little seems to be authentic
history is easily told ; nor are, for our present purpose, of much value the legends, which mangonize the life of Buddha. They will be found in every book that treats of the subject,
and' some of the more famous are translated in the article on
Buddha in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. We content ourselves with the simplest and oldest account, giving such facts as help
to explain the religious significance of Buddha's life and work among his countrymen. Several of these facts, Buddha's place in society, and the geographical centre of Buddhistic
activity, are essential to a true understanding of the relations between Buddhism and Brahmanism. Whether Buddha's father was king or no has rightly been questioned. The oldest texts do not refer to him as a king's
son, and this indicates that his father, who governed the Qakya-land, of which the limits have just been specified,^ was
rather a feudal baron or head of a small clan, than an actual king. The Q)akya power was overthrown and absorbed into that of the king of Oude (Kosala) either in Buddha's own life
time or immediately afterwards. It is only the newer tradition that extols the power and wealth which the Master gave up on
renouncing worldly ties, a trait characteristic of all the later
accounts, on the principle that the greater was the sacrifice the greater was the glory. Whether kings or mere chieftains, the Qakyas were noted as a family that cared little to honor the Brahmanic priests. They themselves claimed descent from
Ikshvaku, the ancient seer-king, son of Manu, and traditionally first king of Ayodha (Oude). They assumed the name of

Gautama, one of the Vedic seers, and it was by the name of 'the Ascetic Gautama' that Buddha was known to his contemporaries ; but his personal name was Siddhartha ' he that
succeeds in his aim,' prophetic of his life ! His mother's
name Maya (illusion) has furnished Senart with material for his sun-theory of Buddha ; but the same name is handed down as that of a city, and perhaps means in this sense ' the wonderful.' She is said to have died when her son was still a boy. The boy Siddhartha, then, was a warrior rajput by birth, and possibly had a very indifferent training in Vedic literature, since he is never spoken of as Veda-wise.' The future Buddha was twenty-nine when he resolved to renounce the world. He was already married and had a son (Rahula, according to later
tradition). The legends of later growth here begin to thicken,
telling how, when the future Buddha heard of the birth of his son, he simply said ' a new bond has been forged to hold me to the world ' ; and how his mind was first awakened to appreciation of sorrow by seeing loathy examples of age, sickness, and death presented to him as he drove abroad. Despite his
father's tears atid protests Siddhartha, or as one may call him now by his patronymic, the man Gautama, left his home and family, gave up all possessions, and devoted himself to self
mortification and Yoga discipline of concentration of thought,
following in this the model set by all previous ascetics. He
says himself, according to tradition, that it was a practical pessimism which drove him to take this step. He was not pleased with life, and the pleasures of society had no charm for him. When he saw the old man, the sick man, the dead man, he became disgusted to think that he too would be subject to
age, sickness, and death : " I felt disgust at old age ; all pleasure then forsook me." In becoming an ascetic Gautama
1 This is Oldenberg's opinion, for the reason here stated. On the other hand it may be questioned whether this negative evidence be conclusive, and whether it be not more probable that a young nobleman would have been well educated.



302 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
simply endeavored to discover some means by which he might avoid a recurrence of life, of which the disagreeable side in his estimation outweighed the joy. He too had already answered negatively the question Is life worth living ? We must pause here to point out that this oldest and simplest account of Gautama's resolve shows two things. It makes clear that Gautama at first had no plan for the uni
versal salvation of his race. He was alert to 'save his own soul,' nothing more. We shall show presently that this is confirmed by subsequent events in his career. The next
point is that this narration in itself is a complete refutation
of the opinion of those scholars who believe that the doctrine
of karma and reincarnation arose first in Buddhism, and that the Upanishads that preach this doctrine are not of the pre-Buddhistic period. The last part of this statement of opinion is, of course, not touched by the story of Gautama's renunciation, but the first assumption wrecks on it. Why should Gautama have so given himself to Yoga discipline ?
Did he expect to escape age, sickness, death, in this life by that means ? No. The assumption from the beginning is the belief in the doctrine of reincarnation. It was in order to free himself from future returns of these ills that Gautama, renounced his home. But nothing whatever is said of his discovering or inventing the doctrine of reincarnation. Both hell and karma are taken for granted throughout the whole early Buddhistic literature. Buddha discovered neither of them, any more than he discovered a new system of morality, or a new system of religious life ; although more credit accrues to him in regard to the last because his order was opposed to that then prevalent ; yet even here he had antique authority for his
discipline.
To return to Gautama's ^ life. Legend tells how he fled

away on his horse Kanthaka, in search of solitude and the
means of salvation, far from his home to the abode of ascetics, for he thought : " Whence comes peace ? When the fire of desire is extinguished, when the fire of hate is extinguished,
when the fire of illusion is extinguished, when all sins and all
sorrows are extinguished, then comes peace." And the only means to this end was the renunciation of desire, the discipline
of Yoga concentration, where the mind fijied on one point loses all else from its horizon, and feels no drawing aside to worldly
things. What then has Gautama done from the point of view of the Brahman ? He has given up his home to become an ascetic. But this was permitted by usage, for, although the strict western code allowed it only to the priest, yet it was customary among the other twice-born castes at an earlier day, and in this
part of India it awakened no surprise that one of the military
caste should take up the life of a philosopher. For the
historian of Indie religions this fact is of great significance, since such practice is the entering wedge which was to split
the castes. One step more and not only the military caste but the lower, nay the lowest castes, might become ascetics.
But, again, all ascetics were looked upon, in that religious
society, as equal to the priests. In fact, where Gautama lived there was rather more respect paid to the ascetic than to the priest as a member of the caste. Gautama
was most fortunate in his birth and birth-place. An aristocrat,
he became an ascetic in a land where the priests were particularly disregarded. He had no public opinion to contend
against when later he declared that Brahman birth and Brahman wisdom had no value. On the contrary, he spoke to
venerable, Arhat (a general title of perfected saints); Tathagata * who is arrived like' (the preceding Buddhas, at perfection); and also by many other names common to other sects, Buddha, Jina, The Blessed One (Bhagavat), The Great Hero, etc. The Buddhist disciple may be a layman, qravaka ; a mohk, i/iikshti ; a perfected saint, arhat; a saintly doctor of the law, bodhisattva ; etc.



304 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
glad hearers, who heard repeated loudly now as a religious truth what often they had said to themselves despitefully in
private. Gautama journeyed as a muni, or silent ascetic sage, till after seven years he abandoned his teachers (for he had become a disciple of professed masters), and discontentedly wandered about in Magadha (Behar), ' the cradle of Buddhism,' till he came to Uruvela, Bodhi Gaya.' Here, having found that concentration of mind, Yoga-discipline, availed nothing, he undertook another method of asceticism, self-torture. This he practiced for some time. But it succeeded as poorly as his first plan, and he had nearly starved himself to death when it occurred to him that he was no wiser than beforg. Thereupon he gave up starvation as a means of wisdom and began to eat. Five other ascetics, who had been much impressed by his endurance and were quite ready to declare themselves his disciples, now deserted him, thinking that as he had relaxed his discipline he must be weaker than themselves. But Gautama sat beneath the sacred fig-tree ^ and lo ! he became illumined. In a moment he saw the Great Truths. He was now the Awakened. He became Buddha. The later tradition here records how he was tempted of Satan. For Mara (Death), ' the Evil One ' as he is called by the Buddhists, knowing that Buddha had fotind the way of salvation, tempted him to enter into Nirvana at once, lest by converting others Buddha should rob Mara of his power and dominion. This and the legend of storms attacking him and his being protected by the king of snakes, Mucalinda, is lack
ing in the earlier tradition.
Buddha remains under the do-tree fasting, for four times seven days, or seven times seven, as says the later report. At

first he resolves to be a 'Buddha for himself,'* that is to save only himself, not to be 'the universal Buddha,' who converts and saves the world. But the God Brahma comes down from heaven and persuades him out of pity for the world to preach
salvation. In this legend stands out clearly the same fact we have animadverted upon already. Buddha had at first no intention of helping his fellows. He found his own road to
salvation. That sufficed. But eventually he was moved through pity for his kind to give others the same knowledge with which he had been enlightened.^ Here is to be noticed with what suddenness Gautama becomes Buddha. It is an early case of the same absence of
study or intellectual preparation for belief that is rampant in the idea of ictic conversion. In a moment Gautama's eyes are opened. In ecstacy he becomes illuminated with the light of knowledge. ' This idea -is totally foreign to Brahmanism. It
is not so strange at an earlier stage, for the Vedic poet often
' sees ' his hymn,^ that is, he is inspired or illumined. But no Brahman priest was ever ' enlightened ' with sudden wisdom, for his knowledge was his wisdom, and this consisted in learning interminable trifles. But the wisdom of Buddha was this :
I. Birth is sorrow, age is sorrow, sickness is sorrow, death is sorrow, clinging to earthly things is sorrow.
II. Birth and re-birth, the chain of reincarnations, result from the thirst for life together with passion and desire.
III. The only escape from this thirst is the annihilation of
desire. IV. The only way of escape from this thirst is by following
the Eightfold Path : Right belief, right resolve, right word,

306 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
right act, right life, right effort, right thinking, right medi
tation.^ But Buddha is said to have seen more than these, the Four Great Truths, and the Eightfold Path, for he was enlightened
at the same time (after several days of fasting) in regard to
the whole chain of causality which is elaborated in the later
tradition.
-- The general result of this teaching may be formulated thus,
that most people are foolishly optimistic and that the great awakening is to become a pessimist. One must believe not only that pain is inseparable from existence, but that the pleasures of life are only a part of its pain. When one has got so far along the path of knowledge he traverses the next stage
and gets rid of desire, which is the root of life, — this is a
Vedic utterance, — till by casting off desire, ignorance, doubt, and heresy, as add some of the texts,^ one has removed far away all unkindness and vexation of soul, feeling good-will
to all.
Not only in this scheme but also in other less formal declarations of Buddha does one find the tey-note of that which
makes his method of salvation different alike to that of Jain or Brahman. Knowledge is wisdom to the Brahman ; asceticism is wisdom to the Jain ; purity and love is the first wisdom to the Buddhist. We do not mean that the Brahman does not reach theoretically a plane that puts him on the same level with Buddhism. We have pointed out above a passage in the work ^ of the old . law-giver Gautama which might almost have been
1 Dhammacakkappavattana, Rhys Davids in his introduction to this suita gives and explains the eight as follows (SBE. xi. p. 144): 1, Right views; freedom from superstition or delusion. 2, Right aims, high and worthy of the intelligent, earnest man. 3, Right speech, kindly, open, truthful. 4, Right conduct, peaceful, honest, pure. 5, Right livelihood, bringing hurt to no living thing. 6, Right effort in selftraining and in self-control. 7, Right mindfulness, the active watchful mind. 8, Right contemplation, earnest thought on the deep mysteries of'life, 2 Hardy, Manual, p. 496.

uttered by Gautama Buddha: ''He that has performed all the forty sacraments and has not the eight good qualities enters not into union with Brahma nor into the heaven of Brahma ; but he that has performed only a part of the forty sacraments
and has the eight good qualities, enters into union with Brahma and into the heaven of Brahma"; and these eight good qualities are mercy, forbearance, freedom from envy, purity, calmness, correct behavior, freedom from greed and from covetousness. Nevertheless with the Brahman this is
adventitious, with the Buddhist it is essential. / These Four Great Truths are given to the world first at Benares, whither Buddha: went in order to preach to the five ascetics that had deserted him. His conversation with them shows us another side of Buddhistic ethics. The five monks, when they saw Buddha approaching, jeered, and said : " Here
is the one that failed in his austerities." Buddha tells them to acknowledge him as their master, and that he is the Enlightened One. "How," they ask, "if you could not succeed in becoming a Buddha by asceticism, can we suppose that you become one by indulgence .' " Buddha tells them that neither voluptuousness nor asceticism is the road that leads to Nirvana ; that he, Buddha, has found the middle path between the two extremes, the note is struck that is neither too high nor too low. The five monks are converted when they hear the Four Great Truths and the Eightfold Path, and there are
now six holy ones on earth, Buddha and his five disciples.
Significant also is the social status of Buddha's first conver
sion. It is ' the rich youth ' of Benares that flock about him,^
of whom sixty soon are counted, and these are sent out into all the lands to preach the gospel, each to speak in his own
tongue, for religion was from this time on no longer to be hid
behind the veil of an unintelligible language. And it is not
1 " A decided predilection for the aristocracy appears to have Hngered as an heirloom of the past in the jolder Buddhism," Oldenberg, Bttddha^ p. 157.



308 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
only the aristocracy of wealth that attaches itself to the new teacher and embraces his doctrines with enthusiasm. The next converts are a thousand Brahman priests, who constituted a religious body under the leadership of three ascetic Brahmans.
It is described in the old writings how these priests were still performing their Vedic rites when Buddha came again to Bodhi Gaya and found them there. They were overcome with astonishment as they saw his power over the King of
Snakes that lived among them. The gods — for Buddhism, if
not Buddha, has much to do with the gods — descend from heaven to hear him, and other marvels take place. The Brahmans are all converted, The miracles and the numbers may
be stripped off, but thus denuded the truth still remains as
important as it is plain. Priests of Brahman caste were among the first to adopt Buddhism. The popular effect of the teaching must have been great, for one reads how, when Buddha, after this great conversion, begins his victorious wanderings in Behar (Magadha), he converted so many of the
young nobles that — since conversion led to the immediate
result of renunciation — the people murmured, saying that Gautama (Gotama) was robbing them of their youth.
^
From this time on Buddha's life was spent in wandering about and preaching the new creed mainly to the people of Bshar and Oude (Kagi-Kosala, the realm of Benares-Oude), his course extending from the (Iravati) Rapti river in the north to Rajagriha (^gaha, now Rajgir) south of Behar, while he spent the vasso or rainy season in one of the parks, many of which were donated to him by wealthy members of the
fraternity.^ Wherever he went he was accompanied with a considerable number of followers, and one reads of pilgrims from distant
1 Mahdvagga^ i. 24. On the name (Gautama) Gotama, see Weber, IS. i. 180. "^ The parks of Veluvana and Jetavana were especially affected by Buddha. Compare Oldenberg, Buddha^ p. 145.



BUDDHISM. 309
places coming to see and converse with him. The number of his followers appears to have been somewhat exaggerated by
the later writers, since Buddha himself, when prophesying of
the next Buddha, the " Buddha of love " (Maitreya) says that, whereas he himself has hundreds of followers, the next Buddha will lead hundreds of thousands.
Although, theoretically, all the castes give up their name, and, when united in the Buddhistic brotherhood, become " like
rivers that give up their identity and unite in the one ocean,"
yet were most of the early recruits, as has been said, from
influential and powerful families ; and it is a tenet of Buddhism in regard to the numerous Buddhas, which have been born ^ and are still to be born on earth, that no Buddha can be born
in a low caste. The reason for this lies as much as anything in the nature of the Buddhistic system which is expressly declared to be "fbr the wise, not for the foolish." It was not a system based as such on love or on any democratic sentiment. It was a philosophical exposition of the causal nexus of birth and freedom from re-birth. The common man, untrained in logic, might adopt the teaching, but he could not understand it.
The " Congregation of the son of the Qalcyas " — such was the
earliest name for the Buddhistic brotherhood — were required only to renounce their family, put on the yellow robe, assume the tonsure and other outward signs, and be chaste and highminded. But the teachers were instructed in the subtleties of
the ' Path,' and it needed no little training to follow the
leader's thought to its logical conclusion. Of Buddha's life, besides the circumstances already narrated little is known. Of his disciples the best beloved was Ananda,
his own cousin, whose brother was the Judas of Buddhism. The latter, Devadatta by name, conspired to kill Buddha in order that he himself might get the post of honor. But hell

310 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
opened and swallowed him up. He appears to have had convictions of Jain tendency, for before his intrigue he preached against Buddha, and formulated reactionary propositions which
inculcated a stricter asceticism than that taught by the
Master.^ It has been denied that the early church contained lay members as well as monks, but Oldenberg appears to have set the matter right (p. 165) in showing that the laity, from the begin
ning, were a recognized part of the general church. The
monk {bhikshu, bhikku) was formally enrolled as a disciple, wore the gown and tonsure, etc. The lay brother, ' reverer
'
(upasakd), was one that assented to the doctrine and treated the monks kindly. There were, at first, only men in the congregation, for Buddhism took a view as unfavorable to woman
as did Jainism. But at his foster-mother's request Buddha
finally admitted nuns as well as monks into his fold. When Ananda asks how a monk should act in presence of a wonSan Buddha says ' avofd to look at her ' ; but if it be necessary to look, 'do not speak to her'; but if it be necessary to speak, 'then keep wide awake, Ananda.'^ Buddha died in the fifth century. Rhys Davids, who puts the date later than most scholars, gives, as the time of the great Nirvana, the second decade from the end of the fourth century. On the other hand, Biihler and Miiller reckon the year as 477, while Oldenberg says 'about 480.'^ From Buddha's own words, as reported by tradition, he was eighty
1 Buddha's general discipline as compared with that of the Jains was much more lax, for instance, in the eating of meat. Buddha himself died of dysentery brought on by eating pork. The later Buddhism interprets much more strictly the rule of ' non-injury ' ; and as we have shown, Buddha entirely renounced austerities, choosing the mean between laxity and asceticism. 2 Or ' take care of yourself ' ; Mahdparinibhdna^ v. 23. 3 The chief Buddhistic dates are given by Miiller (introduction to Dhmmnafada, SEE. vol. X.) as follows : 557, Buddha's birth; 477, Buddha's death and the First Council at Rajagriha; 377, the Second Council at Vai§aK; 259, Agoka's coronation ; Z42, Third Council at Pataliputta ; 222, Ajoka's death. These dates are only tenta

years old at the time of his death, and if one alluts him thirtysix years as his age when he became independent of masters, his active life would be one of forty-four years. It was probably less than this, however, for some years must be added to
the first seven of ascetic practices before he took the field as a preacher.
The story of Buddha's death is told simply and clearly. He crossed the Ganges, where at that time was building the town of Patna (Pataliputta, ' Palibothra '), and prophesied its future
greatness (it was the chief city of India for centuries after);
then, going north from Rajagriha, in Behar, and Vaigali, he proceeded to a point east of Gorukhpur (Kasia). Tradition thus makes him wander over the most familiar places till he comes back almost to his own country. There, in the region known to him as a youth, weighed down with years and "ill
health, but surrounded by his most faithful disciples, he died.
Not unafEecting is the final scene.'' 'Now the venerable Ananda (Buddha's beloved disciple) went into the cloister-building, and stood leaning against the lintel of the door and weeping at the thought : " Alas ! I remain still but a learner, one who has yet to work out his own
perfection. And the Master is about to pass away from me ^— he who is so kind." Then the Blessed One called the brethren and said: "Where then, brethren, is Ananda?" "The vener
able Ananda (they replied) has gone into the cloister-building and stands leaning against the lintel of the door, weeping." . . .
And the Blessed One called a certain brother, and said " Go
tive, but they give the time nearly enough to serve as a guide. From the Buddhists (Ceylon account) it is known that the Council at Vai^ali was held one hundred years after Buddha's death (one hundred and eighteen years before the coronation of Agoka, whose grandfather, Candragupta, was Alexander's contemporary). The interval between Nirvana and Agoka, two hundred and eighteen years, is the only certain date according to Koppen, p. 208, and despite much argument since he wrote, the remark still holds. ' Englished by Rhys Davids, Mahaparinibbana-sutia (SBE. xi. 95 ff.).



312 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
now, brother^ and call Ananda in my name and say, ' Brother Ananda, thy Master calls for thee.' " " Even so. Lord," said that brother, and he went up to where Ananda was, and said to the venerable Ananda: "Brother Ananda, thy Master calls for thee." " It is well, brother," said the venerable Ananda, and he went to the place where Buddha was. And when he was come thither he bowed down before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ananda, as he sat there by his side : " Enough, Ananda, let not thyself be troubled ; weep not. Have I not told thee already that we must divide ourselves from all that is nearest
and dearest ? How can it be possible that a being born to die should not die ? For a long time, Ananda, hast thou been very near to me by acts of love that is kind and good and never varies, and is beyond all measure. (This Buddha repeats three
times.) Thou hast done well. Be earnest in effort. Thou, too, shalt soon be free." . . . When he had thus spoken, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Let not the Blessed
One die in this little wattle and daub town, a town in the midst of the jungle, in this branch township. For, Lord, there are,
other great cities such as Benares (and others).. Let the Blessed One die in one of them." ' This request is refused by Buddha. Ananda then goes to
the town and tells the citizens that Buddha is dying. ' Now, when they had heard this saying, they, with their young men and maidens and wives were grieved, and sad, and afflicted at
heart. And some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and stretched forth their arms, and wept, fell prostrate on the ground and rolled to and fro, in anguish at the thought " Too soon will the Blessed One die ! Too soon will the Happy One pass away ! Full soon will the Light of the world vanish away ! " ' . . . When Buddha is alone again with his disciples, ' then the Blessed One addressed the brethren and said
" It may be, brethren, that there may be doubt or misgiving in



BUDDHISM. 313
the mind of some brother as to the Buddha, the truth, the path
or the way. Inquire, brethren, freely. Do not have to re
proach yourselves afterwards with this thought: ' Our Teacher was face to face with us, and we could not bring ourselves to inquire of the Blessed One when we were face to face with him.' " And when he had thus spoken they sat silent. Then (after repeating these words and receiving no reply) the Blessed One addressed the brethren and said, " It may be that you put no questions out of reverence for the Teacher. Let one friend communicate with another." And when he had thus spoken the brethren sat silent. And the venerable Ananda said: "How wonderful a thing. Lord, and how marvellous. Verily, in this whole assembly, there is not one brother who has doubt or misgiving as to Buddha, the truth, the path or the way." Then Buddha said: "It is out of the fullness of thy faith that thou hast spoken, Ananda. But I know it for certain." . . . Then the Blessed One addressed the brethren saying: "Behold, brethren, I exhort you saying, transitory are all component things ; toil without ceasing." And these were the last words of Buddha.' It is necessary here to make pause for a moment and survey the temporal and geographical circumstances of Buddha's life.
His lifetime covered the period of greatest intellectual growth in Athens. If, as some think, the great book of doubt ^ was
written by the Hebrew in 450, there would be in three lands,
at least, about the same time the same earnestly scornful skepticism in regard to the worn-out teachings of the fathers. But at a time when, in Greece, the greatest minds were still veiling infidelity as best they could, in India atheism was already formulated. It has been questioned, and the question has been answered
both affirmatively and negatively, whether the climatic con
ditiong of Buddha's home were in part responsible for the
1 Ecdesiasies.



314 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
pessimistic tone of his philosophy. If one compare the geographical relation of Buddhism to Brahmanism and to Vedism respectively with a more familiar geography nearer home, he will be better able to judge in how far these conditions may
have influenced the mental and religious tone. Taking Kabul and Kashmeer as the northern limit of the period of the Rig
Veda, there are three geographical centres. The latitude of the Vedic poets corresponds to about the southern boundary of Tennessee and North Carolina. The entire tract covered by the southern migration to the time of Buddhism, extending from Kabul to a point that corresponds to Benares (35° is a little north of Kabul and 25" is a little south of Behar), would
be represented loosely in the United States by the difference between the northern line of Mississippi and Key West. The extent of Georgia about represents in latitude the Vedic province. (35° to 30°), while Florida (30° to 25°) roughly shows the southern progress from the seat of old Brahmanism to the cradle of young Buddhism. These are the extreme limits of Vedism, Brahmanism and proto-Buddhism. South of this the country was known to Brahmanism only to be called savage, and not before the late Sutras (c. 300 B.C.) is one brought as far south as Bombay in the West. The Aitareya Brahmana, which represents the old centre of Brahmanism around Delhi, knows of the Andhras, south of the Godavari river in the southeast (about the latitude of Bombay and Hayti), only as outer 'Barbarians.' It is quite conceivable that a race of hardy mountaineers, in shifting their hoiAe through generations from the hills of Georgia and Tennessee to the sub-tropical region of Key West (to Cuba), in the course of many centuries might become morally affected. But it seems to us, although the miasmatic plains of Bengal may perhaps present even a sharper contrast to the Vedic region than do Key West and Cuba to Georgia, that the climate in effecting a moral degradation (if pessimism be immoral) must have produced also the effect of



BUDDHISM. 315
mental debility. Now to our mind there is not the slightest proof for the asseveration, which has been repeated so often that it is accepted by many nowadays as a truism,, that Buddhism or even post- Buddhistic literature shows any trace of mental decay. ^ There certainly is mental weakness in the Brahmanas, but these cannot all be accredited to the miasms of Bengal. They are the bones of a religion already dead,
kept for instruction in a cabinet ; dry, dusty, lifeless, but awful to the beholder and useful to the owner., Again, does Bud
dhism lose in the comparison from an intellectual point of view when set beside the mazy gropings of the Upanishads ? A^'e have shown that dogma was the base of primal pantheism ; of real logic there is not a whit. We admire the spirit of the teachers in ttie Upanishads, but we have very little respect for
the logical ability of any early Hindu teachers; that is to say, there is very little of it to admire. The doctors of the Upanishad philosophy were poets, not dialecticians. Poetry indeed waned in the extreme south, and no spirited or powerful litera
ture ever was produced there, unless it was due to foreign
influence, such as the religious poetry of Ramaism and the Tamil Sittars. But in secondary subtlety and in the marking of distinctions, in classifying and analyzing on dogmatic premises,
as well as in the acceptance of hearsay truths as ultimate
verities — we do not see any fundamental disparity in these regards between the mind of the Northwest and that of the Southeast ; and what superficial difference exists goes to the credit of Buddhism. For if -one must have dogma it is something to have system, and while precedent theosophy was based on the former it knew nothing of the latter. Moreover, in Bud
dhism there is a greater intellectual'vigor than in ariy phase of j
^ The common view is thus expressed by Oldenberg: " In dem schwulen, feuchten, von der Natur mit Reichthiimern Uppig gesegneten Tropenlande des Ganges hat das \^olk, das in frischer Jugendkraft steht, als es vom Norden her eindringt, bald aufgehort Jung und stark zu sein. Menschen und Volker reifen in jenem Lande . . • schnell heran, um ebenso schnell an Leib und Seele zu erschlaffen " {loc, cii.'p. ii).

Brahmanism (as distinct from Vedism). To cast off not only gods but soul, and more, to deny the moral efficacy of asceti
cism, this was a leap into the void, to appreciate the daring of
which one has but to read himself into the priestly literature of Buddha's rivals, both heterodox and orthodox. We see then in Buddhism neither a debauched moral type, nor a weakened intellectuality. The pessimism of Buddhism, so far as it con
cerns earth, is not only the same pessimism that underlies the religious motive of Brahmanic pantheism, but it is the same pessimism that pervades Christianity and even Hebraism. This world is a sorry place, living is suffering ; do thou escape from it. The pleasures of life are vanity ; do thou renounce
them." "To die is gain," says the apostle; and the Preacher : " I have seen all the works that are done under the sun and
behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit. He that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow. For what hath man of all his labor and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun ? For all his days are sorrows and his travail
grief. That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ;
even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth so dieth the other ; yea, they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast : for all is vanity. All go
unto one place ; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward ? I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living
which are yet alive. The dead know not anything, their love and their hatred apd their envy is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under
the sun. The wandering of the desire, this also is vanity." The Preacher is a fairly good Buddhist. If pessimism be the conviction that life on earth is not worth
living, this view is shared alike by the greatest of earth's religions. If pessimism be the view that all beauty ends with life and that beyond it there is nothing for which it is worth



BUDDHISM. 317
while to live, then India has no parallel to this Homeric belief. If, however, pessimism mean that to have done with existence on earth is the best that can happen to a man, but that there is bliss beyond, then this is the opinion of Brahmanism,
Jainism, and Christianity. Buddhism alone teaches that to live on earth is weariness, that there is no bliss beyond, and that one should yet be calm, pure, loving, and wise. How could such a religion inspire enthusiasm ? How could
it send forth jubilant-Tlisciples to preach the gospel of joy? Yet did Buddhism do even this. Not less happy and blissful than were they that received the first comfort of pantheism were the apostles of Buddha. His progress was a triumph of gladness. They that believed in him rejoiced and hastened to their fellows with the good tidings. Was it then a new
morality, a new ethical code, that thus inspired them? Let one but look at the vows and commandments respectively taken by and given to the Buddhist monk, and he will see that in Buddhism there is no new morality. The Ten Vows are as follows :
I take the vow not to kill ; not to steal ; to abstain from impurity; not to lie ; to abstain from intoxicating drinks which hinder progress and virtue ; not to eat at forbidden times ; to abstain from dancing, singing, music and stage plays ; not to use garlands, scents, unguents, or ornaments ; not to use a high or broad bed ; not to receive gold or silver.
The Eight Commandments are as follows :
Do not kill ; do not steal ; do not lie ; do not drink intoxicating drinks; do not commit fornication or adultery ; do not eat unseasonable food at night ; do not wear garlands or use perfumes ; sleep on a mat spread on the ground.
The first five of these commands are given to every Buddhist, monk, or layman; the last three are binding only on the monk.^ These laws and rules were, however, as we have indicated in
1 Rhys Davids, Buddhism, pp. i6o, 139.



318 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the chapter on Jainism, the common property, with some unimportant variations and exceptions, of the Brahman ascetic, the Jain, and tlie Buddhist. There was surely nothing here to
rouse especial interest. No. But there was one side of Buddhism that was new, not absolutely new, for it formed part of
the moral possession of that early band which we may call the' congregation of the Spirit. The Brahman theoretically had done away with penance and with prayer, with the Vedic gods and with the Vedic rites. Yet was it impossible for him prac
tically to absolve the folk of these. The priest might admit
that he knew a better way to salvation, but he still led the people over the hard old road, and he himself went that way also, because it was the way of the fathers, because it was the only way for them that were unwise, and perhaps, too, because it was the only way in which the priest could keep his place as
guide and leader of the people. Jainism smote down some of the obstacles that the Brahman had built and kept. Mahavira made the way to salvation shorter, but he did not make it easier ,for the masses. Asceti
cism, self-mortification, starvation, torture, — this was hig means of gaining happiness hereafter.
But Buddha cut down all obstacles. He made the lowest equal with the highest. , It is true that he was no democrat.
It is true that his success depended, in great part, on political
influence, on the conversion of kings and nobles, men of his
own class. It is true also that Buddha at first, like every other Hindu theosophist, sought no salvation for the world around him, but only for himself. But he was moved with pity for the multitude. And why ? The sages among them knew no path to happiness save through life-long torture ; the common peo
ple knew only a religion of rites in which they took no interest,
the very words of which were unintelligible ; and its priests in their eyes, if not contemptible, at least were unsympathetic. And at the same time the old caste-system oppressed and in



BUDDHISM. 319
suited them. It is evident that the times were ripe for a more
humane religion and a new distribution of social privileges. Then Buddha arose and said: " He that is pure in heart is the true priest, not he that knows the Veda. Like unto one that standeth where a king hath stood and spoken, and standing and speaking there deems himself for this a king, seems to me the man that repeateth the hymns, which the wise men of old have spoken, and standing in their placeaad—leaking, deems himself for this a sage. The Vedag^re nothing, the
priests are of no account, save as they b^e morally of repute. Again, what use to mortify the flesh ? Asceticism is of no 1
value. Be pure, be good ; this is the foundation of wisdom
to restrain desire, to be satisfied with little. He is a holy man
who doeth this. Knowledge follows this." Here is the essence of Buddhism, here is its power ; and when one reflects that Buddha added: "Go into all lands and preach this gospel ; tell them that the poor and lowly, the rich
and high, are all one, and that all castes unite in this religion,
as unite the rivers in the sea" — he will understand what key was used to open the hearts of Buddha's kinsmen and people.
But, it will be said, there is nothing in this of that extreme pessimism, of which mention has just been made. True. And this, again, is an important point to bear in mind, that whereas the logic of his own system led Buddha into a formal and complete pessimism, which denies an after-life to the man that
finds no happiness in this, he yet never insists upon this. He
not only does not insist, but in his talks with his questioners and
disciples he uses all means to evade direct inquiry in regard to
the fate of man after death. He believed that Nirvana (extinc
tion of lust) led to cessation of being; he did not believe in an immortal soul. But he urged no such negative doctrine as this. What he urged repeatedly was that every one accept-/ ing the undisputed doctrine of karma or re-birth in its full ex
tent (i.e., that for every sin here, punishment followed in the



320 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
next existence), should endeavor to escape, if possible, from such an endless course of painful re-births, and that to accomplish this it was necessary first to be sober and good, then to be learned, but not to be an ascetic. On the other hand the
doctrine, in its logical fullness, was a teaching only for the wise, not for fools. He imparted it only to the wise. What is one to understand from this 1 Clearly, that Buddha regarded the mass of his disciples as standing in need merely of the Four Great Truths, the confession of which was the sign of becoming a disciple ; while to the strong and wise he reserved the logical pessimism, which resulted from his first denials and the premises of causality on which was erected his complicated system. Only thus can one comprehend the importance of Buddhism to his own time and people, only in this light reconcile the discrepancy between the accounts of a religion which roused multitudes to enthusiasm and joy, while on the other hand it stood on the cold basis of complete nihilism. Formally there was not an esoteric -^ and exoteric Buddhism, but practically what the apostles taught, what Buddha himself taught to the mass of his hearers was a release from the bondage of the law and the freedom of a high moral code as the one thing needful. But he never taught that sacrifice was a bad thing ; he never either took the priest's place himself or cast scorn upon the Brahman caste : " Better even than a
harmless ^ sacrifice is liberality " he says, " better than liberal
ity is faith and kindness (non-injury) and truth, better than
faith, kindness, and truth is renunciation of the world and the
search for peace ; best of all, the highest sacrifice and greatest good, is when one enters Nirvana, saying " I shall not return again to earth." This is to be an Arhat (Perfect Sage).
1 Buddha taught, of course, nothing related to the thaumaturgy of that folly which calls itself to-day * Esoteric Buddhism.* 2 That is a sacrifice where no cattle are slain, and no injury is done to living beings.



BUDDHISM. 321
These are Buddha's own words as he spoke with a Brahman priest,^ who was converted thereby and replied at once with the Buddhist's confession of faith : " I take refuge in Buddha,
in the doctrine, in the church." A significant conversation ! In many ways these words should be corrective of much that is hazarded today in regard to Buddhism. There is here no elaborate system of meta
physics. Wisdom consists in the truth as it is in Buddha ;
and before truth stand, as antecedently essential, faith and kindness ; for so may one render the passive non-injury of the Brahman as taught by the Buddhist. To have faith and good works, to renounce the pomps and vanities of life, to show
kindness to every living thing, to seek for salvation, to under
stand, and so finally to leave no second self behind to suffer again, this is Buddha's doctrine. We have avoided thus far to define Nirvana. It has three
distinct meanings, eternal blissful repose (such was the Nirvana of the Jains and in part of Buddhism), extinction and absolute annihilation (such was the Nirvana of some Buddhists), and the Nirvana of Buddha himself. Nirvana meant
to Buddha the extinction of lust, anger, and ignorance. He adopted the terra, he did not invent it. He was often ques
tioned, but persistently refused to say whether he believed that Nirvana implied extinction of being or not. We believe that
in this refusal to speak on so vital/ a point lies the evidence
that he himself regarded the ' extinction ' or ' blowing out ' (this
is what the word means literally) as resulting in annihilation. Had he believed otherwise we think he would not have hesi
tated to say so, for it would have strengthened his influence among them to whom annihilation was not a pleasing thought.
But one has no right to ' go behind the returns ' as these are given by Buddha. The later church says distinctly that Buddha himself did not teach whether he himself, his ego, was to live
1 Kutada7ita-stUta, Oldenberg, Bitddha^ p. 175.



322 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA. >
(after death or not ; or whether a permanent ego exists. It is useless, therefore, to inquire whether Buddha's Nirvana be a completion, as Miiller defines it, or annihilation. To one Buddhistic party it was the one ; to the other, the other ; to Buddha himself it was what may be inferred from his refusal
to make any declaration in regard to it.
The second point of interest is not more easily disposed of.
What to the Buddhist is the spirit, the soul of man ? It cer
tainly is not an eternal spirit, such as was the spirit of Brah
manic philosophy, or that of the Jain. But, on the other hand, it is clear that something survived after death till one was reborn for the last time, and then entered Nirvana. The part that animates the material complex is to the Buddhist an individuality which depends on the nature of its former complex, home, and is destined to project itself upon futurity till the house which it has built ceases to exist, a home rebuilt no more to be its tabernacle. When a man dies the component parts of his material personality fall apart, and a new complex
is formed, of which the individuality is the effect of the karma of the preceding complex. The new person is one's karmic
self, but it is not one's identical ego. There appears, therefore, even in the doctrine of Nirvana, to lie something of that altruism
so conspicuous in the insistence on kindness and conversion of
others. It is to save from sorrow this son of one's acts that one should seek to find the end. But there is no soul to
save.
We cannot insist too often on the fact that the religion of
Buddha was not less practical than human. He practiced, as he taught, that the more one worked for others, was devoted to
others, the less he cared for himself, the less was he the victim of desire. Hence he says that a true Nirvana may come even
in one's own lifetime — the utter surrender of one's self is Nirvana,^ while the act of dying only draws the curtain after
1 Sometimes distinguished itora pari-nirvdna as absolute annihilation.



BUDDHISM. 323
the tragedy has ended. "Except," Buddha says, "for birth, age, and death, there would be no need of Buddha." A review of Buddha's system of metaphysics is, therefore, doubly unnecessary for our present purpose.' In the first
place we believe that most of the categories and metaphysical niceties of Buddhism, as handed down, are of secondary origin
;
and, were this not so, it is still evident that they were but the unimportant, intellectual appendage of a religion that was based on anything but metaphysical subtleties. Buddha, like every other teacher of his time, had to have a 'system,' though whether the system handed down as his reverts to him it is impossible to say. But Buddha's recondite doctrine was only for the wise. " It is hard to learn for an ordinary person," says Buddha himself. But it was the ordinary person that Buddhism took to its bosom. The reason can be only the one we have given. For the last stage before Arhat-ship Buddha had ready a complicate system. But he did not inflict it on the ordinary person.^ It was not an essential but the completing of his teaching ; in his own eyes truth as represented by the Four Great Truths was the real doctrine. The religion of Buddha, for the mass of people, lies/
in the Four Great Truths and their practical application to others, which implies kindness and love of humanity. For Buddha, whatever may have been the reluctance with which he
1 Some scholars think that the doctrine of Buddha resembles closely that of the Sankhya philosophy (so Barth, p, ii6), but Miiller, Oldenberg, and others, appear to be right in denying this. The Sankhyan ' spirit ' has, for instance, nothing corresponding to it in Buddha's system. 2 The twelve Nidanas are dogmatic, and withal not very logical. " From ignorance arise forms, from forms arises consciousness, from consciousness arise name and bodiness ; from name and bodiness arise the six senses (including understanding as the sixth) and their objects; from these arises contact; from this, feeling; from this, thirst ; from this, clinging ; from clinging arises becoming ; from becoming arises birth ; from birth arise age and sorrow." One must gradually free himself from the ten fetters that bind to life, and so do away with the first of these twelve Nidanas, ignorance.

began to preach, shows in all his teachings and dealings with men an enduring patience under their rebuffs, a brotherly sympathy with their weakness, and a divine pity for their sorrows. Something, too, of divine an^er with the pettiness and mean
ness of the unworthy ones among his followers, as when, after preaching with parable and exhortation to the wrangling brothers of the monastery of Kosambi, he left them, saying, "
' Truly these fools are infatuate ; it is no easy task to admin
ister instruction to them,' and," it is added simply, " he rose from his seat and went away." • . The significance of the church organization in the developt ment of Buddhism should not be under-estimated. Contrasted with the lack of an organized ecclesiastical corporation among the Brahmans the Buddhistic synod, or congregation, Sangha, exerted a great influence. In different places there would be a park set apart for the Buddhist monks. Here they had their monastery buildings, here they lived during the rainy season, from this place out as a centre the monks radiated through the country, not as lone mendicants, but as members of a power
ful fraternity. To this monastery came gifts, receipts of all kinds that never would have been bestowed upon individuals. Undoubtedly organization did much for the spread of Buddhism. Yet we think its influence has been emphasized almost too much by some scholars, or rather the effect has been represented as too radical. For the monasteries, as represented by tradition, with their immense wealth and political importance
as allies of the heretical kings of the East, are plainly of sec
ondary growth. If one limit their national and political importance to a period one or two hundred years after the Master's time, he will not err in attributing to this cause, as does Barth, the reason for the rapid rise and supremacy of Buddhism over
India. But the first beginnings of the institution were small, and what is to be sought in the beginning of Buddhism is rather
1 Mahavagga, .\. 3 (SBE. xvii. 306).



BUDDHISM. 325
the reason why the monasteries became popular, and what was the hbld which Buddha had upon the masses, and which induced the formation of this great engine of religious war. And when this first question is raised the answer must still be that the banding together of the monks was not the cause but the effect of the popularity of Buddhism. The first monas
teries, as Barth well says, were only assemblies of pious njen
who formed a spiritual band of religious thinkers, of men who united themselves into one body to the end that they might study righteousness, learning together how to imitate the Master in holiness of living. But the members converted soon became so many that formal assemblies became a necessity to
settle the practical .disputes and theoretical questions wjiich
were raised .by the new multitude of believers, some of whom were more factious than devout. Brahmanism had no need of this. The Brahman priest had his law in tradition ; his life and conduct were regulated by immemorial law. The corporations of these priests were but temporary organizations for specific purposes. They made no attempt to proselytize. Their men> bers never exceeded the bounds of the caste. The cause,l then, of the rapid spread of Buddhism at the beginning of its career lies only in the conditions of its teaching and the influential backing of its founder. It was the individual Buddha that captivated men ; it was the teaching that emanated from him that fired enthusiasm ; it was his position as an aristocrat that made him acceptable to the aristocracy, his magnetism
that made him the idol of the people. From every page stands out the strong, attractive personality of this teacher and
winner of hearts. No man ever lived so godless yet so godlike. Arrogating to himself no divinity, despairing of future bliss, but without fear as without hope, leader of thought but despising
lovingly the folly of the world, exalted but adored, the universal
brother, he wandered among men, simply, serenely ; with gentle irony subduing them that opposed him, to congregation after



326 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
congregation speaking with majestic sweetness, the master to each, the friend of all. His voice was singularly vibrant and eloquent ;
-^ his very tones convinced the heater, his looks inspired awe. From the tradition it appears that he must have been one of those whose personality alone suffices to make a man
not only a leader but a god to the hearts of his fellows. When such an one speaks he obtains hearers. It matters little what he says, for he influences the emotions, and bends whoever
listens to his will. But if added to this personality, if encom
passing it, there be the feeling in the minds of others that what this man teaches is not only a verity, but the very hope of
their salvation ; if for the first time they recognize in his words
the truth that makes of slaves free men, of classes a brother
hood, then it is not difficult to see wherein lies the lightninglike speed with which the electric current passes from heart to heart. Such a man was Buddha, such was the essential of his teaching ; and such was the inevitable rapidity of Buddhistic expansion, and the profound influence of the shock that was produced by the new faith upon the moral consciousness of Buddha's people. The hterature of early Buddhism consists of a number of
historical ,works embodying the life and teaching of the master,
some of more didactic and epigrammatic intent, and, in the writings of the Northern Buddhists, some that have given up
the verbose simplicity of the first tracts in favor of tasteless and extravagant recitals more stagey than impressive. The
final collection of the sacred books (earlier is the Suttanta
division into Nikayas) is called Tripitaka, 'the three baskets,'
one containing the tracts on discipline ; one, the talks of
Buddha ; and one, partly metaphysical ; called respectively Vinaya, Sutta, and Abhidhamma. The Southern "^ Pali

BUDDHISM. 327
redaction — for the writings of the Northern ^ Buddhists
are in Sanskrit — was commented upon in the fifth century of this era by Buddha-gosha (' Buddha's glory '), and appears to be older than the Sanskrit version of Nepal. Some of the writings go back as far as the Second Council, and their content, so far as it concerns Buddha's own words, in many cases is doubtless a tradition that one should accept as author
itative. The works on discipline, instead of being as dull as one might reasonably expect of books that deal with the petty
details of a monastery, are of exceeding interest (although whole chapters conform to the reasonable expectation), for they contain fragments of the work and words of Buddha' which give a clearer idea of his personality and teaching than
do his more extended and perhaps less original discourses.
They throw a strong light also on the early church, its recalci
trant as well as its obedient members, the quarrels and schisms that appear to have arisen even before Buddha's death. Thus in the Mahavagga (ch. x) there is found an account of the schism caused by the expulsion of some unworthy members. The brethren are not only schismatic, some taking the side of those expelled, but they are even insolent to Buddha ; and when he entreats them for the sake of the effect on the outer
world to heal their differences,' they tell him to his face that
they will take the responsibility, and that he need not concern
himself with the matter. It is on this occasion that Buddha says, "Truly, these fools are infatuate," leaves them, and goes
into solitude, rejoicing to be free from souls so quarrelsome and contentious. Again these tracts give a picture of how they
should live that are truly Buddha's disciples. Buddha finds three disciples living in perfect harmony, and asks them how

328 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
they live together so peaceably and lovingly. In quaint and yet dignified language they reply, and tell him that they serve each other. He that rifees first prepares the meal, he that
returns last at night puts the room in order, etc. {ib. 4). Occasionally in the account of unruly brothers it is evident that
tradition must be anticipating, or that many-joined the Bud
dhist fraternity as an excuse from restraint. The CuUavagga opens with the story of two notorious renegades, ' makers of
strife, quarrelsome, makers of dispute, given to idle talk, and
raisers of legal questions in the congregation.' Such were the infamous followers of Panduka: and Lohitaka. Of a different sort. Epicurean or rather frivolous, were the adherents of Assaji and Punabbasu, who, according to another chapter of
the CuUavagga (i. 13), 'cut flowers, planted cuttings of flowers, used ointment and scents, danced, wore garlands, and revelled wickedly.' A list of the amusements in which indulged these flighty monks includes 'games played with six and ten pieces, tossing up, hopping over diagrams, dice, jackstraws,' ball,
sketching, racing, marbles, wrestling,' etc.; to which a like list
{Tevijja, ii) adds chess or checkers ('playing with a board of sixty-four squares or one hundred squares '), ghost stories, and unseemly wrangling in regard to belief ("I am orthodox, you are heterodox "), earning a living by prognostication, by taking omens ' from a mirror ' or otherwise, by quack medicines, and by 'pretending to understand the language of beasts.' It is
gratifying to learn that the scented offenders described in the first-mentioned work were banished from the order. According to the regular procedure, they were first warned, then reminded, then charged ; then the matter was laid before the congregation, and they were obliged to leave the order. Even the detail of Subhadda's insolence is not wanting in these records {Cull. xi. I. and elsewhere). No sooner was Buddha dead than
1 ' Removing pieces from a pile without moving the remainder ' must, we presume, be jaclcstraws.



BUDDHISM. 329
the traitor Subhadda cries out : " We are well rid of him ; he gave us too many rules. Now we may do as we like." On which the assembly proceeded to declare in force all the rules that Buddha had given, although he had left it to them to discard them when they would. The Confessional (Patimokkha), out of which have been evolved in narrative form the Vinaya texts that contain it, concerns graded offences, matters of
expiation, rules regarding decency, directions concerning robes,
rugs, bowls, and other rather uninteresting topics, all discussed
in the form of a confession.' The church-reader' goes over the rules in the presence of the congregation, and asks at the end of each section whether any one is guilty of having broken this
rule. If .at the third repetition no one responds, he says, ' They are declared innocent by their silence.' This was the first public confessional, although, as we have shown above, the idea of a partial remission of sin by means of confession to the priest is found in Brahmanic literature.^ The confession
extends to very small matters, but one sees from other texts that the early congregation laid a great deal of weight on
details, such as dress, as the sign of a sober life. Thus in Mahdvagga, v. 2 ff., certain Buddhists dress in a worldly way.
At one time one is informed of the color of their heretical slip
pers, at another of the make of their wicked gowns. All this
is monastic, even in the discipline which 'sets back' a badly behaved monk, gives him probation, forces him to be subordi
nate. In Cullavagga, i. 9, there is an account of stupid Seyyasaka, who was dull and indiscreet, and was always getting 'set back' by the brethren. Finally they grow weary of probating him and carry out the nissaya against him, obliging him
1 For instance, rules for eating, drinking (liquor), and for bathing. The Buddhist monk, except in summer, bathed once a fortnight only. 2 No one is so holy that sin does not hurt him, according to Buddhistic belief. The Brahman, on the contrary, was liable to become so holy that he could commit any sin and it did not affect his virtue, which he stored up in a heap by cumulative asceticism.



330 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
to remain under the superintendence of others. For, according to Buddha's rule, a wise novice was kept under surveillance,
or rather under the authority of others, for five years ; a stupid uninformed monk, forever. Buddha's relations with society are plainly set forth. One reads how his devoted friend, King Seniya Bimbisara, four years younger than Buddha, and his protector (for he was King of Magadha), gives him a park, perhaps the first donation of this sort, the origin of all the monastic foundations : " The King of Magadha, Bimbisara, thought 'here is this bamboo forest Veluvana, my pleasure
garden, which is'neither too near to the town nor too far from it. . . . What if I were to give it to the fraternity?' . . .
And he took a golden vessel (of water) and dedicated the garden to Buddha, saying, 'I give up the park to the fraternity with Buddha at its head.' And the Blessed One accepted the park" {Mahavagga, i. 22)} Another such park Buddha accepts from the courtezan, Ambapali, whose conversation with Buddha and dinner-party to him forms a favorite story with the monks {Mahav. v. 30 ; Cull. ii). The protection offered by Bimbisara made the order a fine retreat for rogues. In Mahav. i. 41 ff. one reads that King Seniya Bimbisara made a decree : " No one is to do any harm to those ordained among the Qakya-son's monks.'' Well taught is their doctrine. Let them lead a holy life for the sake of complete extinction of suffering." But robbers and runaway slaves immediately took . advantage of this decree, and by joining the order put the f police at defiance. Even debtors escaped, became monks,
and mocked their creditors. Buddha, therefore, made it a
rule that no robber, runaway slave, or other person liable to arrest should be admitted into the order. He ordained further
1 The offering and reception of gifts is always accompanied witli water, both in Buddhistic and Brahmanic circles. Whether this was a religious act or a legal sign of surrender we have not been able to discover. Perhaps it arose simply from water always being offered as refreshment to a guest (with fruit), as a sign of guest-friendship. 2 Sakyaputtiya Samanas, z.e., Buddhists.



BUDDHISM. 331
that no son might join the order without his parents' consent
{ib. 54). Still another motive of false disciples had to be combated. The parents of Upali thought to themselves : "What shall we teach Upali that he may earn his living ? If we teach
him writing his fingers will be sore ; if we teach him arithmetic his mind will be sore ; if we teach him money-changing his eyes will be sore. There are those Buddhist monks ; they live an easy life ; they have enough to eat and shelter from the rain ; we will make him a monk." Buddha, hearing of this, ordained that no one should be admitted into the order under twenty (with some exceptions). The monks' lives were simple. They went out by day to beg, were locked in their cells at night {Mahdv. i. 53), were
probated for light offences, and expelled for very severe ones.' The people are represented as murmuring against the practices of the monks at first, till the latter were brought to more modest behavior. It is perhaps only Buddhist animosity that makes the narrator say : " They did not behave modestly at table. . . . Then the people murmured and said, ' These Buddhist monks make a riot at their meals, they act just like
the Brahman priests' " {Mahdv. i. 25 ; cf. i. 70.) We turn from the Discipline to the Sermons. Here one finds everything, from moral exhortations to a book of Revelations.^ Buddha sometimes is represented as entering upon a dramatic dialogue with those whom he wishes to reform, and the talk is narrated. With what soft irony he questions, with what apparent simplicity he argues ! In the Tevijja^ the scene opens with a young Brahman. He is a pious and religious youth,

and tells Buddha that although he yearns for ' union with Brahma,'^ he does not know which of the different paths proposed by Brahman priests lead to Brahma. Do they all lead to union with Brahma ? Buddha answers : ' Let us see ; has any one of these Brahmans ever seen Brahma?,' 'No, indeed, Gautama.' 'Or did any one of their ancestors ever see Brahma.?' 'No, Gautama.' 'Well, did the most ancient seers ever say that they knew where is Brahma.'' 'No, Gautama.' 'Then if neither the present Brahmans know, nor the old Brahmans knew where is Brahma, the present Brahmans say in point of fact, "We can show the way to union with what we know not and have never seen ; this is the
straight path, this is the direct way which leads to Brahma"
and is this foolish talk?' 'It is foolish talk.' 'Then, as to yearning for union with Brahma, suppose a man should say,
"How I long for, how I love the most beautiful woman in this land," and the people should ask, "Do you know whether that beautiful woman is a noble lady, or a Brahman woman, or of the trader class, or a slave?" and he should say, "No"; and the people should say, "What is her name, is she tall or short, in what place does she live?" and he should say, "I know not," and the people should say, "Whom you know not, neither have seen, her you love and long for?" and he should say,
"Yes," — would not that be foolish?' Then, after this is assented to, Buddha suggests another parallel. 'A man builds a staircase, and the people ask, "Do you know where is the mansion to which this staircase leads?" "I do not know." "Are you making a staircase to lead to something, taking it for a mansion, which you know not and have never seen ? " " Yes." Would not this be foolish talk? . . . Now what think you, is Brahma in possession of wives and wealth?' 'He is not.'
1 What we have several times had to call attention to is shown again by the side light of Buddhism to be the case in Brahmanic circles, namely, that even in Buddha's day while Brahma is the god of the thinkers Indra is the god of the people (together with Vishnu and (^iva, if the texts are as old as they pretend to be).



BUDDHISM. 333
'Is his mind full of anger or free from anger? Is his mind full of malice or free from malice?' 'Free from anger and malice.' 'Is his mind depraved or pure?' 'Pure.' 'Has he selfmastery? ' 'Yes.' 'Now what think you, are the Brahmans in possession of wives and wealth, do they have anger in their
hearts, do they bear malice, are they impure in heart, are they without self-mastery?' 'Yes.' 'Can there then be likeness between the Brahmans and Brahma?' 'No.' 'Will they then after death become united to Brahma who is not at all like them?' Then Buddha points out the path of purity and love. Here is no negative 'non-injury,' but something very different to anything that had been preached before in India. When the novice puts away hate, passion, wrong-doing, sinfulness of every kind, then : 'He lets his mind pervade the whole wide world, above, below, around and everywhere, with a heart of love, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure. And he lets his mind pervade the whole world with a heart of pity, sympathy, and equanimity, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure.' Buddha concludes (adopting for effect the Brahma of his convert) : 'That the monk who is free from anger, free from malice, pure in mind, and master of himself
should after death, when the body is dissolved, become united
to Brahma who is the same — such a condition of things is quite possible.' Here is no metaphysics, only a new religion based on morality and intense humanity, yet is the young man moved to say, speaking for himself and the friend with him : 'Lord, excellent are the words of thy mouth. As if one were to bring a lamp into the darkness, just so, Lord, has the truth been made known to us in many a figure by the Blessed One. And we come to Buddha as our refuge, to the doctrine and to
the church. May the Blessed One accept us as disciples, as
true believers, from this day forth, as long as life endures.' The god Brahma of this dialogue is for the time being playfully accepted by Buddha as the All-god. To the Buddhist

himself Brahma and all the Vedic gods are not exactly nonexistent, but they are dim figures that are more like demi-gods, fairies, or as some English scholars call them, 'angels.' Whether Buddha himself really believed in them, cannot be asserted or denied. This belief is attributed to him, and his church is very superstitious. Probably Buddha did not think
it worth while to discuss the question. He neither knew nor cared whether cloud-beings existed. It was enough to deny a Creator, or to leave no place for him. Thaumaturgical
powers are indeed credited to the earliest belief, but there certainly is nothing iii harmony with Buddha's usual attitude in
the extraordinary discourse called Akankheyya, wherein Buddha is represented as ascribing to monks miraculous powers, only hinted at in a vague ' shaking of the earth ' in more sober speech.^ From the following let the ' Esoteric Buddhists ' of
to-day take comfort, for it shows at least that they share an ancient folly, although Buddha can scarcely be held responsible for it : " If a monk should desire to become multiform, to
become visible or invisible, to go through a wall, a fence, or a mountain as if through air ; to penetrate up or down through solid ground as if through water ... to traverse the sky, to touch the moon ... let him fulfil all righteousness, let him be devoted to that quietude of heart which springs from within ... let him look through things, let him be much alone."
That is to say, let him aim for the very tricks of the Yogis, which Buddha had discarded. Is there not here perhaps a little irony ? Buddha does not say that the monk will be able
to do this — he says if the monk wishes to do this, let him be
quiet and meditate and learn righteousness, then perhaps but he will at least have learned righteousness !
The little tract called Cetokhila contains a sermon which has
not lost entirely its usefulness or application, and it is charac
teristic of the way in which Buddha treated eschatological
1 Mahafarinibbana iii, to which Rhys Davids refers, is scarcely a fair parallel.

conundrums : ' If a brother has adopted the religious life in
the hope of belonging to some one of the angel (divine) hosts, thinking to himself, " by this morality or by this observance or
by this austerity or by this religious life I shall become an
angel,'' his mind does not incline to zeal, exertion, perseverance and struggle, and he has not succeeded in his religious life ' (has not broken through the bonds). And, continuing, Buddha says that just as a hen might sit carefully brooding over her well- watched eggs, and might torment herself with the
wish, ' O that this egg would let out the chick,' but all the time there is no need of this torment, for the chicks will hatch if she keeps watch and ward over them, so a man, if he does not think what is to be, but keeps watch -and ward of his words,
thoughts, and acts, will ' come forth into the light.' "^ The questions in regard to Buddha's view of soul, immortal
ity, and religion are answered to our mind as clearly in the following passages as Buddha desired they should be. ' Unwisely does one consider : " Have I existed in ages past . . .
shall I exist in ages yet to be, do I exist at all, am I, how am I ? This is a being, whence is it come, whither will it go ? " Con
sideration such as this is walking in the jungle of delusion. These £tre the things one should consider : "This is suffering,
this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering,
this is the way that leads to the cessation of suffering." From
him that considers thus his fetters fall away ' {Sabbasavd). In
the Vang'isa-sutta Buddha is asked directly : " Has this good man's life been vain to him, has he been extinguished, or is he still left with some elements of existence ; and how was he liberated ? " and he replies : " He has cut off desire for name and form in this world. He has crossed completely the stream
of birth and death." In the Salla-sutta it is said : " Without cause and unknown is the life of mortals in this world,
1 The imitation of the original play on words is Rhys Davids', who has translated these Suttas in SBE. vol. xi. For the following see FausboU, ib. vol. x.



336 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
troubled, brief, combined with pain. ... As earthen vessels made by the potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals." One should compare the still stronger image, which gives the very name of nir-vdna (' blowing out ') in the Upasivamdnavapuccha : " As a flame blown about by wind goes out and cannot be reckoned as existing, so a sage delivered from name and body disappears, and cannot be reckoned as existing." To this Upasiva replies : " But has he only disappeared, or does he not exist, or is he only free from sickness 1 " To which Buddha : " For him there is no form, and that by which they say he is exists for him no longer." One would think that this were plain enough.
Yet must one always jemember that this is the Arhat's death, the death of him that has perfected himself.^ Buddha, like the Brahmans, taught hell for the bad, and re-birth for them
that were not perfected. So in the Kokdliya-sutta a list of
hells is given, and an estimate is made of the duration of the sinner's suffering in them. Here, as if in a Brahman code, is it taught that ' he who lies goes to hell,' etc. Even the names of the Brahmanic hells are taken over into the Buddhist system, and several of those in Manu's list of hells are found here. On the other hand, Buddha teaches, if one may trust tradition, that a good man may go to heaven. ' On the dissolution of the body after death the well-doer is re-born in some happy state in heaven ' {Mahaparinibbdna, i. 24).^ This, like hell, is a
temporary state, of course, before re-birth begins again on earth.
In fact, Buddhist and Brahmanic pantheists agree in their attitude toward the respective questions of hell, heaven, and karma. It is only the emancipated Arhat that goes to Nirvana.^
1 After one enters on the stream of holiness there are only seven more possible births on earth, with one in heaven ; then he becomes arhat, venerable, perfected, and enters Nirvana. 2 Compare the fairies and spirits in ib. v. lo; and in i. 31, 'give gifts to the gods.'
8 We agree with Rhys Davids, Buddhism, pp. in, 207, that Buddha himself was an atheist ; but to the statement that Nirvana was " the extinction of that sinful,



BUDDHISM. 337
When it is said that Buddha preaches to a new convert ' in due course,' it means always that he gave him first a lecture on morality and religion, and then possibly, but not necessarily, on the ' system.' And Buddha has no narrow-minded aversion to Brahmans; he accepts 'Brahman' as he accepts 'Brahma,' only he wants it to be understood what is a real Brahman : 'A certain Brahman once asked Buddha how one becomes a
Brahman, — what are the characteristics that make a man a Brahman. And the Blessed One said : " The Brahman who has removed all sinfulness, who is free from haughtiness, free from impurity, self-restrained, who is an accomplished master
of knowledge, who has fulfilled the duties of holiness, — such a Brahman justly calls himself a Brahman." '^ The Mahavagga, from which this is taken, is full of such sentiments. As here, in i. 2, so in I. 7: "The Blessed One preached to Yasa, the noble youth, 'in due course,'" that is to say, "he talked about the merit obtained by alms-giving, the duties of morality, about
heaven, about the evils of vanity and sinfulness of desire," and when the Blessed One saw that the mind of Yasa, the noble youth, was prepared, " then he preached the principal doctrine of the Buddhists, namely, suffering, the cause of suf
fering, the cessation of suffering, the Path ; " and " just as a
clean cloth takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the knowledge that whatsoever
is subject to birth is also subject to death." '^
The " spirit and not the letter of the law " is expressed in the formula (^Mahavagga, i. 23) : " Of all conditions that proceed
grasping condition of mind and heart which would otherwise be the cause of renewed individual existences " should in our opinion be added " and therewith the extinction of individuality." Compare Rhys Davids' Hibbert Lectures.^ p. 253. 1 Compare the definition of an ' outcast ' in the Vasala-sutta : '' He that gets angry and, feels hatred, a wicked man, a hypocrite, he that embraces wrong views and is deceitful, such an one is an outcast, and he that has no compassion for living things." 2 Compare ib. 5. 36 : " In due course he spoke, of charity, morality, heaven, pleasure, and the advantage of renunciation."



338 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
from a cause, Buddha has explained the cause, and he has explained their cessation." This is the Buddhist's credo. In several of the sermons the whole gist is comprised in the admonition not to meddle with philosophy, Bor to have any
' views,' for " philosophy purifies no one ; peace alone purifies." ^
Buddha does not ignore the fact that fools will not desire
salvation as explained by him : " What fools call pleasure the noble say is pain ; this is a thing difficult to understand ; the
cessation of the existing body is regarded as pleasure by the noble, but those wise in this world hold the opposite opinion " {Dvayatanup. sutta, 38). '^ But to him the truly wise is the truly pure : " Not by birth is one a Brahman, not by birth is one an outcast ; by deeds is one a Brahman, by deeds is one an outcast " ( Vasala-suttd) ; and not alone in virtue of karma of old, for : " The man who knows in this world the de
struction of pain, who lays aside the burden and is liberated, him I call a Brahman ; whosoever in this world has overcome
good and evil, both ties, who is free from grief and defilement,
and is pure, — him I call a Brahman ; the ignorant say that one is a Brahman by birth, but one is a Brahman by penance,
by religious life, by self-restraint, and by temperance" ( Vasettha
suttd).
The penance here alluded to is not the vague penance of austerities, but submission to the discipline of the monastery
' when exercised for a specific fault. Later Buddhism made of Buddha a god. Even less exaltation than this is met by Buddha: thus : Sariputta says to him, " Such faith have I, Lord, that methinks there never was and
never will be either monk or Brahman who is greater and wiser than thou," and Buddha responds : "Grand and bold are the words of thy mouth ; behold, thou hast burst forth into ecstatic

song. Come, hast thou, then, known all the Buddhas that were ? " " No, Lord." " Hast thou known all the Buddhas that will be?" "No, Lord." "But, at least, thou knowest me, my conduct, my mind, my wisdom, my life, my salvation {i.e., thou knowest me as well as I know myself) ? " " No, Lord." " Thou seest that thou knowest not the venerable Buddhas of the past and' of the future; why, then, are thy words so grand and bold ? " (Mahaparinibbana.) Metaphysically the human ego to the Buddhist is only a col
lection of five skandhas (form, sensations, ideas, faculties of
mind, and reason) that vanishes when the collection is dis
persed, but the factors of the collection re-form again, and the
new ego is the result of their re-formation. The Northern Buddhists, who turn Buddha into a god, make of this an immortal soul, but this is Buddhism in one phase, not Buddha's
own belief. The strength of Northern Buddhism lies not, as
some say, in its greater religious zeal, but in its grosser animism,
the delight of the vulgar.
It will not be necessary, interesting as would be the comparison, to study the Buddhism of the North after this review of the older and simpler chronicles. In Hardy's Manual of Buddhism (p. 138 ff.) and Rockhill's Life of Buddha will be found the weird and silly legends of Northern Buddhism, together with a full sketch of Buddhistic ethics and ontology (Hardy, pp. 460, 387). The most famous of the Northern books, the Lotus of the Law and the Lalita Vistara, give a good idea of the extravagance and supernaturalism that already have begun to disfigure the purer faith. According to Kern, who has translated the former work again (after Burnouf), the whole intent of the Lotus is to represent Buddha as the supreme, eternal God. The works, treating of piety, philosophy,
and philanthropy, contain ancient elements, but in general are
of later form. To this age belongs also the whole collection
of Jatakas, or ' birth-stories,' of the Buddhas that were before



340 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Gautama, some of the tales of which are historically important,
as they have given rise to Western fables.' These birth-stories represent Buddha (often as Indra) as some god or mortal, and tell what he did in such or such a form. It is in a future form that, like Vishnu, who is to come in the avatar of Kalki, the next Buddha will appear as Maitreya, or the 'Buddha of love.'^
Some of the stories are very silly ; some, again, are beautiful
at heart, but ugly in their bizarre appearance. They are all,
perhaps, later than our era." The history of Buddhism after the Master's death has a certain analogy with that of Mohammedanism. That is to say it was largely a political growth. Further than this, of course,
the comparison fails. The religion was affected by heretical
kings, and by nouveaux riches^ for it admitted them all into its
community on equal terms — no slight privilege to the haughty nabob or proud king who, if a believer and follower of Brahman orthodoxy, would have been obliged to bend the head,
yield the path, and fear the slightest frown of any beggar priest
that came in his way. The Maurya monarch A9oka adopted Buddhism as a state religion in the third century B.C., and taught it unto all his people, so that, according to his own account, he changed the creed of the country from Brahmanism to Buddhism.* He was king over all northern India, from Kabul to the eastern ocean, from the northern limi't of Brahmanic civilization to its southern boundary. Buddhist missionaries were now spread over India
1 The distinction between tlie Northern and Southern doctrine is indicated by the terms ' Great Vehicle ' and ' Little Vehicle ' respectively, the former the works of Na^rjuna's school (see below). 2 As Maitrakanyaka Buddha came once to earth " to redeem the sins of men." 8 Of historic interest is the rapport between Brahmanic, Jain, and Buddhist tales. A case of this sort has been carefully worked out by Leumann, Die Legends von Citta %ind Sambhuta, WZKM. v. iii ; vi. i. * " The gods who were worshipped as true divinities in India have been rendered false ... by my zeal"; inscription cited by Barth, p. 135. But A§oka was a very tolerant prince. Barth's notion of Buddhistic persecution can hardly be correct.



BUDDHISM. 341
and beyond it. And here again, even in this later age, one sees how little had the people to do with Buddha's metaphysical system. Like the simple confession ' I take refuge in
Buddha, in the doctrine, and in the church ' was the only credo demanded, that cited above : " Buddha has explained the cause of whatever conditions proceed from a cause, and he
has declared their cessation." In this credo, which is engraved all over India, everything is left in confidence to Buddha. However he explained the reason, that creed is to be accepted without inquiry. The convert took the patent facts of life, believing that Buddha had explained all, and based his own belief not on understanding but on faith. With the council of Patna, 242 B.C., begins at the hands of the missionaries the geographical separation of the church, which results in Southern and Northern Buddhism.^ It is at this period that the monastic bodies become influential. The original Sangha, congregation, is defined as consist
ing of three or more brethren. The later monastery is a business corporation as well as a religious body. The great emperors that now ruled India (not the petty clan-kings of the centuries before) were no longer of pure birth, and some heresy was the only religion that would receive them with due honor. They affected Buddhism, endowed the monasteries, in every way enriched the church, built for it great temples, and in turn were
upheld by their thankful co-religionists. Among the six ^ rival heresies that of Buddha was predominant, and chiefly because of royal influence. The Buddhist head of the Ceylon church was Agoka's own son. Still more important for Buddhism was its adoption by the migratory Turanians in the centuries following. Tibet and China were opened up to it through the
influence of these foreign kings, who at least pretended to
1 Koppen, Die Religion des Budd/ia, p. 198. 2 Not to be confused with the seventeen heresies and sixty-three different philosophical systems in the church itself.



3*2 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
adopt the faith of Buddha.^ But as it was adopted by them, and as it extended beyond the limits of India, just so much weaker it became at home, where its strongest antagonists
were the sectarian pantheistic parties not so heterodox as
itself.
Buddhism lingered in India till the twelfth or thirteenth century, although in the seventh it was already decadent, as apggars from the account of Hioueri-Thsang, the Chinese pil
grim. It is found to-day in Tibet, Ceylon, China, Japan, and other outlying regions, but it is quite vanished from its old
home. The cause of its extinction is obvious. The Buddhist victorious was not the modest and devout mendicant of the early church. The fire of hate, lighted if at all by Buddhism,^ smouldered till Brahmanism, in the form of Hinduism, had begotten a religion as popular as Buddhism, or rather far more popular, and for two reasons. Buddhism had no such picturesque tales as those that enveloped with poetry the history of 'the man-god Krishna. Again, Buddhism in its monastic development had separated itself more and more from the people. Not mendicant monks, urging to a pure life, but opulent churches with fat priests ; not simple discourses calculated to awaken the moral and religious consciousness, but subtle arguments on discipline and metaphysics were now what Buddhism represented. This religion was become, indeed, as much a skeleton as was the Brahmanism of the sixth century. As the Brahmanic belief had decomposed into spiritless rites, so Buddhism,
1 For more details see Barth, loc. cit., p. 130 ff. According to tradition Buddhism was introduced into Tibet in the fourth century, A.D., the first missionaries coming from Nepal (Rockhill, p. 210). 2 Barth justly discreditsthetaleof Buddhism having been persecuted out of India. In this sketch of later Buddhism we can but follow this author's admirable summary of the causes of Buddhistic decline, especially agreeing with him in assigning the first place to the torpidity of the later church in matters of religion. It was become a great machine, its spiritual enthusiasm had been exhausted ; it had nothing poetical or beautiful save the legend of Buddha, and this had lost its freshness ; for Buddha was now, in fact, only a grinning idol.



BUDDHISM. 343
changed into dialectic and idolatry (for in lieu of a god the later church worshipped Buddha), had lost now all hold upon the people. The love of man, the spirit of Buddhism, was dead, and Buddhism crumbled into the dust. Vital and energetic was the sectarian ' love of God ' alone (Hinduism), and this now became triumphant. Where Buddhism has succeeded is not where the man-gods, objects of love and fear, have entered; but where, without rivalry from more sympathetic beliefs,, it
has itself evolved a system of idolatry and superstition ; where all that was scorned by the Master is regarded as holiest, and
all that he insisted upon as vital is disregarded.^ One speaks of the millions of Buddhists in the world as one speaks of the millions of Christians; but while there are some Christians that
have renounced the bigotry and idolatry of the church, and
hold to the truth as it is in the words of Christ, there are still fewer Buddhists who know that their Buddhism would have been rebuked scornfully by its founder. The geographical growth of formal Buddhism is easily sketched. . After the first entrance into Kashmeer and Ceylon,
in the third century B.C., the progress of the cult, as it now may be called, was steadily away from India proper. In the
fifth century A.D., it was adopted in Burraah,^ and in the seventh in Siam. The Northern school kept in general to the ' void ' doctrine of Nagarjurfa, whose chief texts are the Lotus
and the Lalita Vistara, standard works of the Great Vehicle.^
In Tibet Lamaism is the last result of this hierarchical statechurch.^ We have thought it much more important to give a
1 Here are developed fully the stories of hells, angels, and all supernatural paraphernalia, together with theism, idolatry, and the completed monastic system ; magic, fable, absurd calculations in regard to nothings, and spiritual emptiness. 2 At the same .time the Ceylon canon was fixed by the commentary of Buddhaghosha. 3 Later it follows the mystical school. Both schools have been affected by Brahmanism. The Great Vehicle, founded by Nagarjuna, was reCognized at a fourth council in Kashmeer about the time of the Christian era. Compare Koppen, p. igg. * On the Lamaistic hierarchy and system of succession see Mayers, JRAS. Iv. 284.



344 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
fuller account of early Buddhism, that of Buddha, than a full account of a later growth in regions that, for the most part, are
not Indie, in the belief that the Pali books of Ceylon give a truer picture of the early church than do those of Kashmeer and Nepal, with their Qlivaite and Brahmanic admixture. For in truth the Buddhism of China and Tibet has no place in
the history of Indie religions. It may have been introduced by Hindu missionaries, but it has been re-made to suit a foreign people. This does not apply, of course, to the canon
ical books, the Great Vehicle, of the North, which is essentially native, if not Buddhistic. Yet of the simple narrative and the adulterated mystery-play, if one has to choose, the former must take precedence. From the point of view of history. Northern Buddhism, however old its elements, can be regarded only as an admixture of Buddhistic and Brahmanic ideas. For this reason we take a little more space, not to cite from the Lotus
or the grotesque Lalita Vistara,^ but to illustrate Buddhism at
its best. Fausboll, who has translated the dialogue that
follows, thinks that in the Suttas of the Sutta-nipata there is a reminiscence of a stage of Buddhism before the institution of
monasteries, while as yet the disciples lived as hermits. The
collection is at least very primitive, although we doubt whether
the Buddhist disciples ever lived formally as individual her
mits. All the Samanas are in groups, little ' congregations,' which afterwards grew into monasteries. This is a poetical (amoebic) contest between the herdsman. Dhaniya and Buddha, with which FausbblP compares St. Luke, xii. 1 5, but which, on the other hand reminds one of a spiritualized Theocritus, with whom its author was, perhaps, contemporary. i.
' For the same reason we do not enter upon the outer form of Buddhism as expressed in demonology, snake-worship (JRAS. xii. 286) and symbolism {ib. OS. xiii. 71, 114). 2 SEE, vol. X, part ii, p. 3.

From Buddha's sermons choice extracts were gathered at an
early date, which, as well as the few longer 'discourses, that
have been preserved in their entirety, do more to tell us what was the original Buddha, before he was enwrapped in the scholastic mysticism of a later age, than pages of general
critique. Thus in the Mahdparinibbana casual allusion is made to assemblies of men and of angels (divine beings), of the great
thirty-three gods. Death the Evil One and Brahma (iii. 21). Buddha, as we have said, does not deny the existence of spiritual beings ; he denies only their power to affect the per
fect man and their controlling part in the universe. In the
same sermon the refuge of the disciple is declared to be truth and himself (ii. 33) : " Be ye lamps unto yourselves. Betake
yourselves to no external refuge. Hold fast to the truth as to a lamp." And from the famous 'Path of Duty' or ' Collection of truths':-'
All that we are is the result of what we have thought : it is founded on our thoughts ; it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought pain follows him as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage, (but) if a man speaks or acts with a pure thought happiness follows him like a shadow that never leaves him. Earnestness is the path that leads to escape from death, thoughtlessness is the path that leads to death. Those who are in earnest do not die;^

those who are thoughtless are as if dead already. Long is the night to him who is awake ; long is a mile to him who is tired ; long is life to the foolish. There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey and abandoned grief, who has fi-eed himself on all sides and thrown off the fetters. Some people are born again ; evil-doers go to hell ; righteous people go to heaven ; those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvana. He who, seeking his own happiness, punishes or kills beings that also long for happiness, will not find happiness after death. Looking for the maker of this tabernacle I shall have to run through a course of many births, so long as I do not find ; and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen ; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; thy mind, approaching Nirvana, has attained to extinction of all desires.^ Better than going to heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of entering the stream of holiness. Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that is the teaching of the Buddhas. Let us live happily, not hating them that hate us. Let us live happily, though we call nothing our own. We shall be like bright gods, feeding on happiness. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he that is free from lust knows neither grief nor fear. The best of ways is the eightfold (path) ; this is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of intelligence. Go on this way ! Everything else is the deceit of Death. You yourself must make the effort. Buddhas are only preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of Death.^
1 Buddha's words on becoming Buddha. 2 It is to be observed that transmigration into animal forms is scarcely recognized by Buddha. He assumes only men and superior beings as subjects of Karma. Compare Rhys Davids' Lectures, pp. 105, 107. To the same scholar is due the statement that he was the first to recognize the true meaning of Nirvana, ' extinction (not of soul but) of lust, anger, and ignorance.' For divisions of Buddhist literature other than the Tripitaka.the same author's Hibbert Lectures may be consulted (see also Miiller, SEE. x, Introduction, p. i.).



CHAPTER XIV.
EARLY HINDUISM.
While the great heresies that we have been describing were agitating the eastern part of India/ the old home of Brahman
ism in the West remained trus, in name if not in fact, to the ancient faith. But in reality changes almost as great as those of the formal heresies were taking place at the core of Brah
manism itself, which, no longer able to be the religion of a few clans, was now engaged in the gigantic task of remodelling and assimilating the indigenous beliefs and religious practices of its new environment. This was not a cgnscious act on the part of Brahmanism. At first it was undertaken almost unwittingly, and it was accomplished later not without repugnance. But to perform this task was the condition of continued existence. Brahmanism had to expand, or shrink, wither, and
die.
For a thousand years almost the only source of information in regard to this new growth is contained in the epic poetry of the time, with the help of a few additional facts from the
law, and some side light from inscriptions. It is here that Vishnuism and Qivaism are found as fully developed sectarian beliefs, accepted by Brahmanism with more or less distrust,
and in more or less fulness of faith. It is to the epic that one
1 The rival heresies seem also to belong to the East. There were thus more than half a dozen heretical bodies of importance agitating the region about Benares at the same time. Subsequently the Jains, who, as we have shown, were less estranged from Brahmanism, drifted westward, while the Buddhist stronghold remained in the East (both, of course, being represented in the South as well), and so, whereas Buddhism eventually retreated to Nepal and Tibet, the Jains are found in the very centres of old and new (sectarian) Brahmanism, Delhi, Mathura, Jeypur, Ajmlr.



EARLY HINDUISM. 349
must turn to study the budding and gradual flowering of the
modern religions, which have cast strict orthodoxy into the shade. Of the two epics, one, the Ramayana,^ has become the Old Testament of the Ramaite Vishnuites of the present day. The Bharata,^ on the other hand, is scriptural for all sects, because
it is more universal. The former epic, in its present form, is
what the Hindus call an ' art-poem,' and in its finish, its exclusively romantic style, and its total lack of nervous dramatic power, it is probably, as the Hindus claim, the work of one man, Valmiki, who took the ancient legends of Eastern India and moulded them into a stupid sectarian poem. On the other hand, the Bharata is of no one hand, either in origin or in final redaction ; nor is it of one sect ; nor has it apparently been thoroughly affected, as has the Ramayana, by Buddhistic influences. Moreover, in the huge conglomeration of stirring adventure, legend, myth, history, and
superstition which goes to make up the great epic there is contained a far truer picture of the vulgar custom, belief, and religion of the time than the too polished composition of Val
miki is able to afford, despite the fact that the latter also has many popular elements welded into it. There are, in fact,
only two national works in India, only two works which, withal,
not in their entirety, but in their nucleus, after one has stripped
each of its priestly toggery, reflect dimly the heart of the people,
not the cleverness of one man, or the pedantry of schools. For a few Vedic hymns and a few Bharata scenes make all the literature, with perhaps the exception of some fables, that is not markedly dogmatic, pedantic, or 'artificial." So true is this that even in the case of the Ramayana one never feels
1 ' The wandering of Rama,' who is the sectarian representative of Vishnu. 2 The ' Bharata (tale)', sometimes called Maha-Bharata, or Great Bharata. The Vishnuite sectarianism here advocated is that of Krishna. But there is as much Qivaism in the poem as there is Vishnuism. 8 Dramatic and lyric poetry is artificial even in language.



350 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
that he is getting from it the genuine belief of the people, but only that form of popular belief which Valmiki has chosen to let stand in his version of the old tale. The great epic is heroic, Valmiki's poem is romantic ; the former is real, the
latter is artificial ; and the religious gleaning from each cor
responds to this distinction.'
The Bharata, like other Hindu works, is of uncertain date, but it was completed as a ' Great Bharata ' by the end of the sixth century a.d., and the characters of the story are mentioned, as well known, by Panini, whose work probably belongs , to the fourth century B.C. Furthermore, Dio Chrysostomos, probably citing from Megasthenes, refers to it ; and the latter authority describes the worship of the chief gods of the epic
;
while the work is named in one of the domestic Sutras, and
a verse is cited from it in the legal Sutra of Baudhayana.^ On the other hand, in its latest growth it is on a par with the
earlier Puranas, but it is not quite so advanced in sectarianism as even the oldest of these writings. It may, then, be reck
oned as tolerably certain that the beginnings of the epic date from the fourth or fifth century before the Christian era, and that it was quite a respectable work by the time that era began ; after which it continued to grow for five centuries more.^ Its religious importance can scarcely be overestimated. In 600 A.D., far away from its native home, in Cambodia, it was encircled with a temple, and an endowment was made by the
1 Schroeder, p. 453, compares the mutual relation of the Mahabharata and Ramayana to that of the Nibelungenlied and the Parzival of Wolfram von Eschenbach. Jacobi, in his ' Ramayana,' has lately claimed a considerable antiquity for the foundation legends of the Ramayana, but he does not disprove the late completed form. 2 i. 78. 10; see Biihler's Introduction. 8 Jacobi seeks to put the completed nucleus at the time of the Christian era, but it must have been quite a large nucleus in view of the allusions to it in precedent literature. Holtzmann -puts the completion at about 1000 A.D. ; but in 700 A.D. it was complete, and most scholars will agree with Biihler that the present Maha-Bharata was completed by the sixth or seventh century. In 533 A.D. it contained 100,000 distichs, that is, it was about the size it is now.



EARLY HINDUISM. 351
king providing for the daily recitation of the poem. Its legal
verses are authoritative ; its religion is to-day that of India as
a whole. The latest large additions to it were, as we think, the Book of Laws, the Book of Peace, and the genealogy of
Vishnu, which together form a sort of pseudo-epic. But portions of other books, notably the first, fourth, and seventh, are probably almost as recent as are the more palpable inter
polations.
The Bharata (or the epic ko-t iioxqv) gives us our first view of Hinduism in its sectarian developments. But no less does it show us a changing Brahmanism. The most typical change in the Brahmanism of this period, which covers all that time called by Miiller the era of the Renaissance, and ends with the pedantically piquant literature of the drama,^ is the ab
normal growth of the ascetic religious exercise. Older Brah
manism, like the sects, admitted Yogis and ascetics of various kinds, but their aim was to attain oneness with God ; and ' union ' (with God) is the yoga (Latin jiigum has the same origin) which they sought. But it was not long before the starved ascetic, with his wild appearance and great reputation for sanctity, inspired an awe which, in the unscrupulous, was easily turned to advantage. The Yogi became more or less
of a charlatan, more or less of a juggler. Nor was this all. Yoga-practices began to take precedence before other religious
practices. In the Brahmanas it is the sacrifice that is godcompelling ; but in the epic, although sacrifice has its place, yet when miraculous power is exerted, it is due chiefly to Yoga concentration, or to the equally general use of formulae ; not
1 By the time the drama began the epic was become a religious storehouse, and the actual epic story represented not a fifth of the whole work, so that, with its simple language, it must have seemed, as a literary production, very wearisome to the minds that delighted in the artificial compounds and romantic episodes of the drama and lyric. But even to-day it is recited at great fetes, and listened to with rapt attention, as the rhapsodes with more or less dramatic power recite its holy verses.



352 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
formulae as part of a sacrifice, but as in themselves potent
;
and mysterious mantras, used by priest and warrior alike, serve every end of magic.^ Apart from acquisition of power, this Yoga-training is, moreover, all that is needful from the point
of view of righteousness. Physical prowess here is the one
thing admirable. To stand for years on one leg, to be eaten,
by ants, to be in every way an ascetic of the most stoical sort,
is the truest religion. Such an ascetic has no ordinary rules
of morality. In fact, his practices are most peculiar, for to seduce young women is one of his commonest occupations ; and in his anger to cause an injury to his foes is one of the ends for which he toils. The gods are nothing to him. They are puppets whom he makes shake and tremble at will. As portrayed in the epic, in terms of common sense, the Muni (silent saint) is a morose^ and very vulgar-minded old man, who seeks to intimidate others by a show of miraculous jpower. In the matter of penances those of the law are extended beyond all
bounds. The caste-restrictions are of the closest, and the most heinous crime is to commit an offence against casteorder. On the other hand, the greatest merit is to give gifts to priests. This had already proceeded far enough, as was indicated by a passage cited above from Manu. But in the epic the greed and rapacity of the priest exceeds all imaginable limits. He takes whatever he can get and asks for more. He has, by his own showing, scarcely one estimable trait. Avarice,
cupidity, sensuality, gluttony, love of finery, effeminacy, mean
ness, and pride — everything charged against him by the
Buddhist — are his most marked characteristics. He appears,
1 The later law-books say expressly that women and slaves have a right to use mantra, mantradhikarinas. But the later legal Smritis are no more than disguised sectarian Puranas. 2 Compare the visit of the old Muni on the prince in iii, 262. 8. He is paraviakopana, ' extremely irritable ' ; calls for food only to reject it ; growls at the service etc. Everything must be done 'quickly' for him. "I am hungry, give me food, giiick," is his way of speaking, etc. (12). The adjective is one applied to the k\\^ods, paramakrodhinas.



EARLY HINDUISM. . 3S3
however, to be worse than he always was. For nothing is plainer, from this very epic, than that the priests, although
united as a caste, were sharply distinguished in their lives.
The ascetic described above represents the fourth period of the priestly life. Below these stood (apart from students)-' hermits and householders. The householders, or such of them as the epic unfortunately is busied with, the royal priests, seem
to be those that are in reality priests only in name. In the
king's palace, his constant advisors, his most unscrupulous upholders in wickedness, they gave themselves up to quest of wealth and power. But one would err if he thus dismissed them all. There were others that had no preferment, who lived in quiet content in their own houses, and deserved none of the
opprobrium rightly bestowed upon their hypocritical brothers.
The hermits, too, appear to have been a mild and inoffensive
race, not presuming too much on their caste-privileges. To offset rapaciousness there are tomes of morality of the purest sort. Even in the later additions to the epic one reads: " Away with gifts ; receiving gifts is sinful. The silkworm
dies of its wealth " (xii. 330. 29). One should compare, again, the exalted verse (Buddhistic in tone) of ib. 321. 47: "The
red garment, the vow of silence, the three-fold staff, the water
pot — these only lead astray; they do not make for salvation."
There were doubtless good and bad priests, but the peculiarity of
the epic priest, rapacious and lustful, is that he glories in his
sins.
The chief objects of worship (except for the influence of the
sectarian religions) were priests, Manes, and, for form's sake, the Vedic gods. These gods, with the addition of the Hindu
Plutus (Kubera, the god of riches), are now called the eight
'world-guardians,' viz., Indra, Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Agni,
1 Each spiritual teacher instructed high-caste boys, in classes of four or five at most. In xii. 328. 41 the four students of ? priest go on a strike because the latter wants to take another pupil besides themselves and his own son.



3'S4 . THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Surya, Vayu, Soma, and are usually simple and shadowy subordinates of the greater new gods. In the shifting of religious opinion and in the development
of theological conceptions what difference can be traced between the same gods as worshipped in the Veda' and as worshipped in the epic ? Although the Vedic divinities have been twice superseded, once by the Father-god and again by the (itmd, Lord, they still remain adorable and adored, active in many ways, though passive before the great All-god. It is,
indeed, extremely difificalt, owing to the superstruction of sec
tarian belief, to get dov/n to the foundation-religion of the
epic. The best one can do is to see in what way the old gods
differ, as represented in the poem, from their older selves of the Rig Veda. From this point of view alone, and entirely irrespective of the sects, manifold changes will be seen to have taken place. Great Soma is no more. Soma is there, the moon, but the glory of the Vedic Soma has departed. His lunar representative is of little importance. Agni, too, is
changed. As Fire in the Rig Veda is not only the altar-fire, but also common, every-day fire, so, too, in the epic this god is the material flame, and as such even performs his greatest deeds for his worshippers. He takes on every form, even becoming a priest, and a dove. He remains the priest of the gods, but his day of action in war is over. He no longer
wins battles. But he burns down a forest to aid his party. For the Vedic gods are now but weak partizans of the combatants. In the sectarian parts of the epic Agni is only a
puppet. His new representative, Skanda, is the chief battlegod, a name almost unknown before. He himself is either the son of Vishnu or a form of Qiva. He is the All-god, the atma. It is he who burns the world when the time shall have come for the general destruction. The high and mighty Varuna of the Rig Veda is no longer great. He is no longer serene. He descends and fights on



EARLY HINDUISM. 355
earth. Indra, too, battles with Vritra as of old, but he is quite anthropomorphic, and of no marked value in the contest of
heroes. Not only this, but all the gods together are represented as weaker than a good hero, not to speak of a priestly
ascetic. In a word, the gods are believed in, but with what a
belief ! They no longer, as natural powers, inspire special
respect. Their nature-origin is for the most part lost. They are thoroughly anthropomorphic. Even Siirya, the sun, in
action if not in laudation, is often more man than god. This
gives a strange effect to the epic battle-scenes as compared with those of Homer. Unless Vishnu is active On the field
the action is essentially human. No great god or goddess
stands ready to save the fainting warrior. He fights and falls
alone. Save for the caresses and plaudits of the half-gods, the most that the Vedic gods can do is to wipe away the sweat from the hero's brow.^ The All-god does not take the place of the band of watchful and helpful gods pictured by Homer.
Vishnu fights on the field ; he saves only his prote'ges, and much as a mortal warrior would do it. But the- Vedic gcds
hang like a mist upon the edge of battle, and are all but idle
spectators of the scene. Abstractions, as well as the All-god, have routed them, and Dharma or Duty is a greater god than Indra. But there is an older side to this, as we shall presently
show. On the moral side the heroes of the epic profess great belief in the power and aWfulness of this god Duty. And so
far as go rules of chivalry, they are theoretically moral. Prac
tically they arj savage, and their religion does not interfere
with their brutal barbarity. The tendency to cite divine instances of sin as excuse for committing it is, however, rebuked : " One should neither practice nor blame the (wrong)
acts of gods and seers," xii. 292. 17-18.
1 The saints in the %Vy praise the combatants (vii. 188. 41 ; viii. 15. 27); and. the gods roar approval of prowess "with roars like a Uon's" (viii. 15. 33). Indra and Surya and the Apsarasas cool off the heroes with heavenly fans (ib. 90. iS). For the last divinities, see Holtzmann's essays, ZDMG. xxxii. 290 ; xxxiii. 631.



356 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
From an eschatological point of view it is most difficult t6 get back of the statements made by the priestly composers/ who, in their various reeditings of ths epic, uniformly have given the pantheistic goal as that in which the characters believe. But it is evident that the warriors were not much affected by this doctrine. To them there was one law of righteousness
exceeding all others — to die on the field of battle. And for such as did so, over and over again is the assurance given that 'happiness in Indra's heaven' is their reward. And probably
a true note is struck in this reiterated promise. To the mass of the vulgar, union with brahma would have been no attractive end.
It is interesting to see the remains of the older belief still flourishing in midst of epic pantheism. Although Indra has no
such hymn as has Surya, yet is he still lauded, and he is a very real person to the knight who seeks his heaven.^ In fact, so long as natural phenomena were regarded as divine, so long as thunder was godly, it was but a secondary question which name the god bore ; whether he was the ' chief and king of gods,' or Vishnu manifesting himself in a special form. This form, at any rate, was to endure as such till the end of the cycle. There
are other Indras. Each cycle has its own (i. 197. 29). But sufficient unto the age is the god thereof. If, relinquishing the
higher bliss of absorption, the knight sought only Indra's heaven,
1 The original author of the Mahabharata i^ reputed to be of low caste, but the writers of the text as it is to-day were sectarian priests. It was written down, it is said, by Ganega, ' lord of the troops ' of Qiva, i. i. 79, and some historic truth lies in the tale. The priests of (^iva were the last to retouch the poem, as we think. 2 Agni-worship is partly affected by the doctrine that the Samvartaka fire (which destroys the world at the cycle's end) is a form of Vishnu. In Stambamitra's hymn it is said : " Thou, Agni, art the all, in thee rests the universe . . . Sages know thee as single yet manifold. At the expiration of time thou burnest up the three worlds, after having created them. Thou art the originator and support of all beings
"
(i. 232. 12). Elsewhere more Vedic epithets are given, such as ' mouth of the gods' (ii. 31. 42), though here 'the Vedas are produced for Agni's sake.' In this same prayer one reads, ' may Agni give me energy ; wind, give me breath ; earth, give m.e strength ; and water, give me health ' (45). Agni, as well as (Jiva, is the father of Kumara Kartikeya, i.e., Skanda {ib. 44).



EARLY HINDUISM. 357
and believed he was to find it, then his belief practically does
not differ much from that of his ancestor, who accepts Indra as
an ultimate, natural power.^ The question arises whether, after
all, the Indra-worship of the epic is not rather popular than
merely old and preserved. Certainly the reality of the belief seems quite as strong as that of the ever-newly converted sec
tary. It may be doubted whether the distribution of theologi
cal belief is very different in the epic and Vedic ages. Philo
sophical pantheism is very old in India. The priest believes
one thing ; the vulgar, another. The priest of the Vedic age,
like the philosopher of the next age, and like the later sectarian, has a belief which runs ahead of the popular religion. But the popular religion in its salient features still remains about the
same. Arjuna, the epic hero, the pet of Krishna, visits Indra's heaven and stays there five years. It is the old Vedic gods to whom he turns for weapons, till the Qivaite makes Indra send the knight further, to Civa himself. The old name, king of the Vasus, is still retained for Indra ; and though the ' divine weapons,' which are winged with sacred formulae, are said to be more than a match for the gods ; though in many a passage the knight and the saint make Indra tremble, yet still appear,
through the mists of ascetic and sectarian novelties, Indra's heaven and his grandeur, shining with something of their old
glory. Vishnu still shows his solar origin. Of him and of the
sun is it said in identical words : " The sun protects and devours all," and "Vishnu protects and devours" (of Vishnu,
passim; of the sun, iii. 33. 71). A good deal of old stuff is left in the Forest Book amongst the absurd tales of holy watering places. One finds repeated several times the Vedic account
of Indra's fight with Vritra, the former's thunderbolt, however,
being now made of a saint's bones (iii. ch. 100-105). Agni is lauded {ib. ch. 123). To the Agvins-' there is one old hymn
iJBut the Ajvins are Qudras in the ' caste-hood of gods' (the caste-order being Angirasas, Adityas, Maruts and Agvins), xii. 208. 23-25 ; and Indra in one passage refuses to associate with them, xiii. 157. 17 (cited by Holtzmann, ZDMD. xxxii. 321).



358 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
which contains Vedic forms (i. 3). Varuna is still lord of the West, and goes accompanied with the rivers, ' male and female,' with snakes, and demons, and half-gods (ddityas, sadhyas,
daivatas). Later, but earlier than the pseudo-epic, there stands
with these gods Kubera, the god of wealth, the 'jewel-giver,' who is the guardian of travellers, the king of those demons called Yakshas, which the later sect makes servants of Qiva. He is variously named ; ^ he is a dwarf ; he dwells in the North, in Mt. Kailasa, and has a demoniac, gate-keeper, Macakruka. Another newer god is the one already referred to, Dharma Vaivasvata, or Justice (Virtue, Right), the son of the sun, a title of Yama older than the Vedas. He is also the father of
the new love-god, Kama. It is necessary to indicate the names of the gods and their functions, lest one imagine that with pantheism the Vedic religion expired. Even that old, impious
Brahmanic fable crops out again : " The devils were the older brothers of tlje gods, and were conquered by the gods only with
trickery" (iii. 33. 60), an interesting reminiscence of the fact
that the later name for evil spirit was originally the one applied to the great and good spirit (Asura the same with Ahura).^ According to a rather late chapter in the second book each of the great Vedic gods has a special paradise of his own, the most remarkable feature of the account being that Indra's
heaven is filled with saints, having only one king in it — a view quite foreign to the teaching that is current elsewhere in
the epic. Where the sectarian doctrine would oppose the old belief it set above Indra's heaven another, of Brahma, and above that a third, of Vishnu (i. 89. 16 if.). According to one passage Mt. Mandara'' is a sort of Indian Olympus. Another account speaks of the Himalayas, Himavat, as 'the divine
1 Manibhadra, in iii. 64, is l<ing of Yaksash ; he is the same with Kubera, ib. ch. 41 (Vai^ravana). 2 In the Cosmogony the gods are the sons of tlie Manes, xii. 312. 9. 8 When the gods churn the ocean to get ambrosia, an ancient tale of the epic, Mandara is tlie twirling-sticlc. It is situated in modern Behar, near Bhagalpur.



EARLY HINDUISM. 359
mountain, beloved of the ^ods,' though the knight goes thence to Gandhamadana, and thence to Indrakila, to find the gods'
habitat (iii. 37. 41). Personified powers lie all around the
religious Hindu. And this is especially true of the epic character. He prays to Mt. Mandara, and to rivers, above all to
the Ganges. Mt. Kolahala is divine, and begets divine offspring on a river (i. 63). The Vindhya range of mountains rivals the fabled Meru (around whicli course the sun and all
the heavenly bodies), and this, too, is the object of devotion and prayer.^ In one passage it is said that in Behar (Magadha) there was a peak which was continuously ' worshipped with offering's of flowers and perfumes,' exactly as if it were a god. The reason why flowers are given and worn is that they bring
good luck, it is said in the same chapter (ii. 21. 15, 20, 51).
What is, perhaps, the most striking feature of Hindu religious
thought, as a whole, is the steadfastness with which survive, even in the epic and in Buddhism, the forms and formulae of the older faith. At a time when pantheism or nihilism is the avowed creed the ancient gods still exist, weak, indeed, yet infused with a true immortality. This is noticeable even more in unnoticeable ways, in the turns of speech, in little compari
sons, in the hymns, in short, in the by-play of the epic. ' Withered are the garlands of the gods, and their glory is departed,'^ but they still receive homage in time of need. And in that homage is to be seen, and from the same cayse, the revived or surviving worship of the Veda. Each god in turn is mighty, though Agni is the mightiest of the old divini
ties. In an epic hymn to him it is said : " Thou art the mouth
1 iii. 42 ; 139. 14, where tlie Ganges and Jumna are invoked together with the Vedic gods. So in iii. 104 (Vindhya); and Damayanti prays to mountains. Mt. Meru is described in iii. 163. 14 (compare i. 17. 5 ff.). Ift i. 18. i ff., is related the churning of the ocean, where Indra (vs. 12) places Mt. Mandara on Vishnu, the tortoise. ^ Mbh. i. 30. 37, maml-ur mdiydni devdtidm, etc. The older belief was that the gods' garlands never withered ; for the gods show no mortal signs, cast no shad> ows, etc.

of the worlds ; the poets declare thee to be one and three-fold ;
as carrier of the sacrifice they arrange thee eight-fold. By thee was all created, say the highest seers. Priests that have made
reverence to thee attain the eternal course their acts have won, together with their wives and sons. They call thee the water
giver in the air, together with lightning. On thee first depends
water. Thou art the creator and Brihaspati, thou art the two Horsemen, the two Yamas, Mitra, Soma, Wind " (i. 229. 23 ff.).^ And yet this is in a pantheistic environment ! The Rig Veda
is directly invoked, though, of course, not directly,.cited, in the old hymn to the Horsemen, who are, however, elsewhere put with low animals and Guhyakas, demons (i. 66).^ They are the "physicians of the gods," the "first-born," the golden birds which weave the white and black of time, create the wheel of time with all its seasons, and make the sun and sky (i. 3. 55 ff.,

" vagbhir rgbhis "). Indra himself is extolled in Kadru's hymn ; he is the slayer of Namuci, the lord of Qaci ; he is the great
cloud, cloud and its thunder, creator and destroyer ; he is
Vishnu, ' Soma, greatly praised,' as well as fire, air, time in all its .divisions, earth and ocean ; when lauded he drinks the soma, and he is sung in the Vedangas (i. 25. yff.). Praised with this hymn in time of need of rain, Indra " commanded the clouds, saying, 'rain down the ambrosia ' " (26. 2); where there is still the rain as synonymous with ambrosia, and Indra not very differently conceived from his Vedic self. Thus in comparisons : " As Indra standing in heaven brings bliss to the world of the living, so Vidura ever brought bliss to the Pandus " (i. 61. 15). But at the same time what changes ! The gods assemble and sing a hymn to Garuda, the epic form of Garutman, the heavenly bird, who here steals the soma vainly guarded
1 Compare the four hymnlets to Agni in i. 232. 7 ff. 2 After the mention of the thirty-three gods, and Vishnu ' born after them,' it is said that the Agvins, plants, and animals, are Guhyakas (vs. 40), though in vs. 35 : " Tvashtar's daughter, the wife of Savitar, as a mare (vadava) bore in air the two A§vins" (see above), in Vedic style. For (Jruti compare iii. 207. 47; 208. 6, 11.

by the gods. Garuda, too, is Prajapati, Indra, and so forth.' The gods are no longer divinities distinct from the dead Fathers, for they are " identical in being." So Agni says when the latter is cursed by Bhrigu : "The divinities and the Manes
are satisfied by the oblation in fire. The hosts of gods are waters,
so, too, are the Manes. The feasts of the new and full moon belong to the gods with the Manes ; hence the Manes are
divinities and the divinities are Manes. They are of one
being (ekibhutas). I (Fire) am the mouth of both, for both eat the oblation poured upon me. The Manes at the new moon, the gods at the full, are fed by my mouth" (i. 7. 7ff.).^ Such gods
the epic hero fears not (i. 227. 38 fi.). Hymns to them are par
alleled by hymns to snakes, as in i. 3: i34ff., against whom is made the '' sarpasattram (snake sacrifice) of the Puranas"
. (i. 51. 6). Divinity is universal. Knights are as divine as the divinest god, the All-god. Arjuna, the god-born man, to whom Krishna reveals the Divine Song, is himself god.'' In this case whether god becomes human, or vice versa, no one knows. Under the all-embracing cloak of pantheism the heart of the epic conceals many an ancient rite and superstition. Here is the covenant of blood, the covenant of death (represented by the modern ' sitting ' ^), and the covenant of water, which symbolizes both friendship and the solemnity of the curse. The former are illustrated by Bhima's drinking blood as a sign that he will fulfil his vow,^ and by Rama lying by Ocean to die
unless Ocean grants his wish. Of the water-rite that of offer
li. 23. I5ff. His name is explained fancifully in 30. 7. 2 It is at the funeral feasts to the Manes that the Mahabharata is to be recited
(i. 62. 37). 8 Arjuna is an old name of Indra, and in the epic Arjuna is Indra's son. < The legal dliarna or sitting at a debtor's door, which still obtains in India, is, so far as we know, not a very ancient practice. But its application in the case of heralds (who become responsible) is epic. 6 This is'the covenant (with friends) of revenge ; the covenant of mutual protection in the sacrifice is indicated by the ' protection covenant ' of the gods (see the chapter on Brahmanism above, p. 192).



362 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
ing water in hospitality and as a form in reception of gifts is general ; that of cursing by ' touching water ' (iidry upaspr^yd), occurs in iii. lo. 32. For this purpose holy-grass and other symbols are known also,' and formulae yield only in potency to love-philters and magic drugs. Another covenant besides those just noticed seems to lie concealed in the avoidance of the door when injury is intended. If one goes in by the door he is a guest who has anticipated hospitality, and then he dares
not refuse the respect and offering of water, etc, which makes
the formal pact of friendship. If, on the contrary, he does not go in by the door he is not obliged to receive the offering, and
may remain as a foe in the house (or in the city) of his enemy, with intent to kill, but without moral wrong. This may be implied in the end of the epic, where Agvatthaman, intent on secret murder of his foe, is prevented by god Civa from enter
ing in at the gate, but going in by stealth, and ' not by the
door ' of the camp, gets to his foe, who lies asleep, and kills
him (x. 8. 10). This might be thought, indeed, to be merely
strategic, but it is in accordance with the strict law of all the
law-books that one, in ordinary circumstances, shall avoid to enter a town or a house in any other way than through the door (Manu, iv. 73; Gaut. 9. 32, etc.), and we think it has a moral significance, for this a-dvara (non-door) rule occurs again in the epic in just the circumstances we have described.
The heroes in this case are not afraid of their foe, who is in his town. They insult every one as they approach, but they find some other way of getting in than by passing through the gate, for the express purpose of being morally able to make the king fight with them after they have entered his city. And they cite the rule 'according to law,' which is that one may enter his foe's house by a-dvara, ' not by door,' but his friend's house only ' by door.' As they have not entered ' by door ' they say they may refuse the hospitality which the king urges them
1 See an essay on the Ruling Caste in the epic, in JAOS. xiii. 232 ff.



EARLY HINDUISM. 363
to accept, and so they kill him (ii. 21. 14, 53). Stepping in through the door seems, therefore, to be a tacit agreement that
one will not injure the resident.-'
In the epic, again, fetishism is found. The student of the
' science of war,' in order to obtain his teacher's knowledge when the latter is away, makes a clay image of the preceptor and worships this clay idol,, practicing arms before it (i. 132.
33). Here too is embalmed the belief that man's life may be bound up with that of some inanimate thing, and the man perishes with the destruction of his psychic prototype (iii. 135). The old ordeals of fire and water are recognized. " Fire does not burn the house of good men." " If (as this man asserts) he is Varuna's son, then let him enter water and let us see if
he will drown " (iii. 134. 27 ff.). A human sacrifice is per
formed (iii. 127); although the priest who performs it is cast
into hell {ib. 128).^ The teaching in regard to hells is about the same with that already explained in connection with the law-books, but the more definite physical interpretation of hell
as a hole in the ground {garta, just as in the Rig Veda) is retained. Agastya sees his ancestors 'in a hole,' which they
call ' a hell ' (nirayd). This is evidently the hell known to the
law-punsters and epic (i. 74., 39) z.s puttra, ' the //^/ hell ' from
which the son (^putra) delivers (trd). For these ancestors are in the 'hole ' because Agastya, their descendant, has not done his duty and begotten sons (i. 45. 13; iii. 96. 15); one son being 'no son' according to law and epic (i. 100. 68), and all the merit of sacrifice being equal to only one-sixteenth of that obtained by having a son. The teaching, again, in regard to
1 Reverend Doctor H. C. Trumbull has kindly called our attention to Robert's Oriental Illustrations, p. 148 ff., where it is said that in India to-day the threshold is sacred. In reference to threshold-offerings, common in the law, Dr. Trumbull's own forthcoming book on Covenants may be compared. 2 But' these are by no means the last examples of human sacrifices. Several of the modern Hindu sects have caused to be performed such sacrifices, even in this cen- tury.



364 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the Fathers themselves (the Manes), while not differing materially from the older view, offers novelties which show how little the absorption-theory had taken hold of the religious con
sciousness. The very fact that the son is still considered to
be as necessary as ever (that he may offer food to his ances
tors) shows that the believer, whatever his professed faith, ex
pects to depend for bliss hereafter upon his post mortem meals, as much as did his fathers upon theirs. In the matter of the
burial of the dead, one finds, what is antique, that although
accprding to the formal law only infants are buried, and adults are burned, yet was burial known, as in the Vedic age. And the
still older exposure of the body, after the Iranian fashion, is not only hinted at as occurring here and there even before the
epic, but in the epic these forms are all recognized as equally approved : " When a man dies he is burned or buried or exposed " {nikrsyate)^ it is said in i. 90. 17; and the narrator
goes on to explain that the "hell on earth," of which the
auditor " has never heard " (vs. 6) is re-birth in low bodies, speaking of it as a new doctrine. " As if in a dream remaining conscious the spirit enters another form"; the bad becoming insects and worms ; the good going to heaven by means of the " seven gates," viz., penance, liberality, quietism, self-control, modesty, rectitude, and mercy. This is a union of two views, and it is evidently the popular view, that, namely, the good go to heaven while the bad go to new existence in a low form, as opposed to the more logical conception that both alike enter new forms, one good, the other bad. Then the established stadia, the pupil, the old teaching {iipanishad~) of the householders, and the wood-dwellers are described, with the remark that there is no uniformity of opinion in regard to them ; but the ancient view crops out again in the statement
1 This can hardly mean ' put out on the river ' as has been suggested as an explanation of the corpse 'thrown aside' in accordance with the earlier text, AV. xviii. i, 34 {paro^ta), where the dead are ' buried, thrown aside, burned, or set out.'



EARLY HINDUISM. 365
that one who dies as a forest-hermit " establishes in bliss " ten
ancestors and ten descendants. In this part of the epic the Pun
jab is still near the theatre of events, the ' centre region ' being between the Ganges and Jumna (i. 87. 5); although the later additions to the poems show acquaintance with all countries, known and unknown, and with peoples from all the world.
Significant in xii. 61. i, 2 is the name of the third order bhdikshyacaryam ' beggarhood ' (before the forest-hermit and after the householder). It was said above that the departed Fathers could assume a
mortal form. In the formal classification of these demigods
seven kinds of Manes are enumerated, the title of one subdivision being ' those embodied.' Brahma is identified with the Father-god in connection with the Manes : " All the Manes worship Prajapati Brahma," in the paradise of Prajapati,
where, by the way, are Qiva and Vishnu (ii. 11. 45, 50, 52; 8. 30). According to this description 'kings and sinners,' to
gether with the Manes, are found in Yama's home, as well as
"those that die at the solstice" (ii. 7ff.; 8. 31). Constantly the reader is impressed with the fact that the characters of the epic are acting and thinking in a way not conformable to the idea one might form of the Hindu from the law. We have animadverted upon this point elsewhere in connection with another matter. It is this factor that makes the study of the
epic so invaluable as an offset to the verisimilitude of belief, even
as belief is taught (not practiced) in the law. There is a very old rule, for instance, against slaughtering animals and eating meat; while to eat beef is a monstrous crime. Yet is it plain from the epic that meat-eating was customary, and Vedic texts
are cited {iti (rutii) to prove that this is permissible ; while a
king is extolled for slaughtering cattle (iii. 208. 6-1 1). It is
said out and out in iii. 313. 86 that 'beef is food,' gatir annam.
Deer are constantly eaten. There is an amusing protest
. against this practice, which was felt to be irreconcilable with



366 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the ahimsd (non-injury) doctrine, in iii. 258, where the remnant of deer left in the forest come in a vision and beg to be spared. A dispute between gods and seers over vegetable
sacrifices is recorded, xii. 338. Again, asceticism is not the
duty of a warrior, but the epic hero practices asceticism
exactly as if he were a priest, or a Jain, although the warning
is given that a warrior ' obtains a better lot ' ijoka) by dying in
battle than by asceticism. The asceticism is, of course, exag
gerated, but an instance or two of what the Hindu expects in this regard may not be without interest. The warrior who be
comes an ascetic eats leaves, and is clothed in grass. For one
month he eats fruits every third day (night); for another month every sixth day ; for another month every fortnight
;
and for the fourth month he lives on air, standing on tiptoe
with arms stretched up. Another account says that the knight eats fruit for one month ; water for one month ; and for the third month, nothing (iii. 33. 73; 38. 22-26; 167). One may compare with these ascetic practices, which are not so exaggerated, in fact, as might be supposed,^ the ' one-leg ' practice of virtue, consisting in standing on one leg, ekapadena, for
six months or longer, as one is able (i. 170. 46; iii. 12. 13-16). Since learning the Vedas is a tiresome task, and ascetic practice makes it possible to acquire anything, one is not surprised
to find that a devotee undertakes penance with this in view, and is only surprised when Indra, who, to be sure has a personal interest in the Vedas, breaks in on the scene and rebukes the ascetic with the words: "Asceticism cannot teach the Vedas; go and be tutored by a teacher" (iii. 135. 22).
One finds in the epic the old belief that the stars are
the souls of the departed,^ and this occurs so often that it is
1 It is assumed in xii. 364. 2 that " leaves and air " are food enougli for a great saint. Compare below the actual asceticism of modern devotees. 2 iii. 23. 14 : saptarsayas . . . divi viprabhanti. Compare ib. 261. 13, and the apocalypse in vii. 192. 52 ff., where Drona's soul ascends to heaven, a burning fire like a



EARLY HINDUISM. 367
another sign of the comparative newness of the pantheistic doctrine. When the hero, Arjuna, goes to heaven he approaches the stars, "which seen from earth look small on account of their distance," and finds them to be self-luminous
refulgent saints, royal seers, and heroes slain in battle, some of
them also being nymphs and celestial singers. All of this is in contradiction both to the older and to the newer systems of
eschatology ; but it is an ancient belief, and therefore it is pre
served. Indra's heaven,'' Amaravati, lies above these stars. '^
No less than five distinct beliefs are thus enunciated in regard
to the fate of good men after death. If they believe in the
All-god they unite with him at once. Or they have a higher course, becoming gradually more elevated, as gods, etc., and
ultimately ' enter ' the All-god. Again they go to the world of Brahma. Again they go to Indra's heaven. Again they be
come stars. The two last beliefs are the oldest, the brahmaloka belief is the next in order of time, and the first-mentioned are the latest to be adopted. The hero of the epic just walks up to heaven, but his case is exceptional. While angels and spirits swarm about the world in every shape from mischievous or helpful fairies to Rahu, whose head
still swallows the sun, causing eclipses (i. 19. 9), there are a
few that are especially conspicuous. Chief of the good spirits,
attendants of Indra, are the Siddhas,^ 'saints,' who occasionally appear to bless a hero in conjunction with 'beings invis
sun; in sharp contrast to the older 'thumbkin' soul which Yama receives and carries off in the tale of Satyavant. Compare also Arundhatl in i. 233. 29. 1 Described, as above, as a place of singers and dancers, where are the Vedic gods and sages, but no sinners or cowards (iii. 42. 34 ff.). 2 From another point of view the stars are of interest. They are favorable or unfavorable, sentient, kind, or cruel ; influential in man's fate. Compare iii. 200. 84, 85, where the sun is included with \.\\&grahas (planets) which influence men, and ib. 209. 21, tulyanaksatramangala. '* Other of Indra's spirits are the singers, Gandharvas and Apsarasas ; also the horse-headed Kinnaras and Caranas, who, too, are singers ; while later the Vidyadharas belong both to Indra and to Qiva. In modern times the South Indian Sittars, ' saints,' take their name from the Siddhas,



368 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
ible' (iii. 37. 21). Their name means literally 'blessed' or ' successful,' and probably, like the seers, Rishis, they are the
departed fathers in spiritual form. These latter form various classes. There are not only the 'great seers,' and the still
greater ' l>rakma-s&&rs,' and the 'god-seers,' but there are even
'devil-seers,' and 'king-seers,' these being spirits of priests of
royal lineages.' The evil spirits, like the ggds, are sometimes
grouped in threes. In a blessing one cries out: "Farewell (svasti gacchahy anamayam) ; I entreat the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Marut-hosts and the All-gods to protect thee, together with the Sadhyas ; safety be to thee from all the evil beings
that live in air, earth, and heaven, and from all others that dog
thy path." ^ In xii. 166. 61 ff. the devils fall to earth, moun
tains, water, and other places. According to i. 19. 29. it is not long since the Asuras were driven to take refuge in earth
and salt water.^ These creatures have every kind of miraculous power, whether they be good or bad. Hanuman, famed in both epics, the divine monkey, with whom is associated the divine 'king of bears' Jambavan (iii. 280. 23), can grow greater than mortal eye can see (iii. 150. 9). He is still worshipped as a
great god in South India. As an illustration of epic spiritism
the case of Ilvala may be taken. This devil, daiteya, had a trick of cooking his embodied younger brother, and giving him to saints to eat. One saint, supposing the flesh to be mutton (here is saintly meat-eating !), devours the dainty viand ;
upon which the devil 'calls' his brother, who is obliged to come, whether eaten or not, and in coming bursts the saint
1 In danavarsi there is apparently the same sort of compound as in devarsi and hrahntarsi, all associated w;th the siddlias in iii. 169. 23. But possibly * demons and seers ' may be meant. 2 iii. 37. 32-35 t^prapadye vigvedevdn !). 3 Weber finds in the Asuras' artisan, Asura Maya, a reminiscence of Ptolemaios.
He is celebrated in i. 228. 39, and ii. 1, and is the general leader of the danavas, demons, perhaps originally a folk-name of enemies.



EARLY HINDUISM. 369
that has eaten him (iii. 96). This is folk-lore ; but what reli
gion does not folk-lore contain ! So, personified Fate holds its own as an inscrutable power, mightier than others.' There is another touch of primitive religious feeling which reminds
one of the usage in Iceland, where, if a stranger knocks at the
door and the one within asks ' who is there ? ' the guest an
swers, 'God.' So in the epic it is said that ' every guest is god Indra' {Parjanyo ' nnanusamcaran, iii. 200. 123. In the epic Parjanya, the rain-god, and Indra are the same). Of popular
old tales of religious bearing may be mentioned the retention and elaboration of the Brahmanic deluge-story, with Manu as
Noah (iii. 187); the A^vins' feats in rejuvenating (iii. 123) ; the combats of the gods with the demons (Namuci, Qambara, Vala, Vritra, Prahlada, Naraka), etc. (iii. 168). Turning now to some of the newer traits in the epic, one
notices first that, while the old sacrifices still obtain, especially
the horse-sacrifice, the rajasuya and the less meritorious vajapeya, together with the monthly and seasonal sacrifices, there
is in practice a leaning rather to new sacrifices, and a new
cult. The soma is scarce, and the putika plant is accepted as
its substitute (iii. 35. 33) in a matter-of-course wa);-, as if this substitution, permitted of old by law, were now common. The sacrifice of the widow is recognized, in the case of the wives
of kings, as a means of obtaining bliss for a woman, ^ for the
religion of the epic is not entirely careless of woman. Some
what new, however, is the self-immolation of a man upon the
pyre of his son. Such a case is recorded in iii. 137. ig, where a father burns his son's body, and then himself enters
1 See below. The formal division is, ddiva, hatha, karma, i.e., man's fate depends on gods. Fate, and liis own acts ; altliough hatha, Fate, is often implied in daiva, ' the divine power.' But they are separated, for example, in iii. 183. 86. 2 Compare the tales and xii. 148. 9, satl (suttee). In regard to the horse-sacrifice, compare Yama's law as expounded to Gautama : " The acts by which one gains bliss hereafter are austerities, purity, truth, worship of parents, and the horse-sacrifice." xii. 129. 9, 10.



370 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the fire. New also, of course, are the sectarian festivals and sacrifices ; and pronounced is the gain in the go'dhead of priests, king, parents, elder brother, and husband. The priest has long been regarded as a god, but in the epic he is god of gods, although one can trace even here a growth in adulation.' The king, too, has been identified before this period with the
gods. But in the epic he is to his people an absolute divinity,^
and so are the parents to the son ; ^ while, since the elder
brother is the same with a father, when the father is dead the
' younger brother worships the elder. So also the wife's god is her husband ; for higher even than that of the priest is the
husband's divinity (iii. 206). The wife's religious service is
not concerned with feasts to the Manes, with sacrifice to the
gods, nor with studying the Veda. In all these she has no
part. Her religion is to serve her husband (iii. 205. 23), and to die, if worthy of the honor, on his funeral pyre. Other
wise the epic woman has religious practices only in visiting the holy watering-places, which now abound, and in reading the epic itself. For it is said of both practices: " Whether man or
woman read this book (or ' visit this holy pool ') he or she is freed from sin" (so in iii. 82. 33: "Every sin committed since birth by man or woman is absolved by bathing in holy Pushkara"). It may be remarked that as a general thing the dei
ties invoked by women are, by predilection, female divinities, some of them being mere abstractions, while ' the Creator ' is
1 Compare iii. 200. 88, even prdkrta priests are divine and terrible (much more in later books). YL^xt prdkrta^ vulgar, is opposed to samskrta, refined, priests. 2 iii, 185. 26-31. 3 " My father and mother are my highest idol; I do for them what I do for idols. As the three and thirty gods, with Indra foremost, are revered of all the world, so are my parents revered by me" (iii. 214. 19, 20). The speaker further calls them paramam brahma, absolute godhead, and explains his first remark by saying that he offers fruits and flowers to his parents as if they were idols. In iv. 68. 57a man salutes {abhivddyd) his father's feet on entering into his presence. For the worship of parents compare xii. 108. 3 ; 128. 9, 10 ; 267. 31, xiii. 75. 26 : " heroes in obedience to the mother."



EARLY HINDUISM. 371
often the only god in the woman's list, except, of course) the
priests : " Reverence to priests, and to the Creator . . . May
Hri, Qrl (Modesty and Beauty), Fame, Glory, Prosperity, Uma (Qiva's wife), Lakshmi (Vishnu's wife), and also Sarasvati, (may all these female divinities) guard thy path, because
thou reverest thy elder brother," is a woman's prayer (iii. 37.
26-33).' Of the sectarian cults just mentioned the brahmamaha, i.
164. 20, elsewhere referred to, is the all-caste^ feast in honor
of Brahma (or of the Brahmans) ; as ib. 143. 3 one finds a samaja in honor of Qiva ; and distinctly in honor of the same god of horror is the sacrifice, i.e.., immolation, of one hundred kings, who are collected "in the temple of 5'va," to be slaughtered
like cattle in Magadha (ii. 15. 23) ; an act which the heroes of the epic prevent, and look upon with scorn.'' As a substitute for the rajasuya, which may be connected with the human sac
rifice (^Ind. Streifen, i. 61), but is the best sacrifice because it has the best largesse (iii. 255. 12), the Vaishnava is suggested
to Duryodhana. It is a great sattrain or long sacrifice to Vishnu {ib. 15 and 19); longer than a Vishnuprabodha (26 Oct.). There is a Smriti rite described in iii. 198. 13 as a svastivdcanam, a ceremony to obtain a heavenly chariot which brings prosperity, the priests being invoked for blessings {svasti). Quite modern, comparatively speaking, is the cult of holy pools ; but it is
to be observed that the blessings expected are rarely more than the acquirement of brahma-viovlAs, so that the institution
seems to be at least older than the sectarian religions, although naturally among the holy pools is intruded a Vishnu-pool. This religious rite cannot be passed over in silence. The
custom is late Brahmanic (as above), and still survives. It
1 The marked Brahma Creator-worship is a bit of feminine religious conservatism (see below). 2 Weber has shown that men of low caste took a subordinate part even in the rajasuya sacrifice. 3 In ii. iS. there is a brand-new festival appointed in honor of a female fiend, etc.



372 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
has been an aspect of Hindu religion for centuries, not only in the view taken of the pools, but even occasionally in the place itself. Thus the Ganges, Gaya, Prayaga, and Kuru-Plain are to-day most holy, and they are mentioned as among the
holiest in the epic catalogue.' Soma is now revamped by a
bath in a holy pool (ix. 35. 75). As in every antithesis of act
and thought there are not lacking passages in the epic which decry the pools in comparison with holy life as a means of salva
tion. Thus in iii. 82. g £f., the poet says : "The fruit of pil
grimage (to holy pools) — he whose hands, feet, and mind are controlled ; ^ he who has knowledge, asceticism, and fame, he gets all the fruit that holy pools can give. If one is averse
from receiving gifts, content, freed from egoism, if one injures
not, and acts disinterestedly, if one is not gluttonous, or carnal
minded, he is freed from sin. Let one (not bathe in pools but)
be without wrath, truthful, firm in his vows, seeing his self in
all beings." This is, however, a protest little heeded.^ Pilgrimage is made to pool and plain, to mountain, tree, and river. Even then, as now, of all pilgrimages that to Ganges was most esteemed : " Originally all were holy ; in the second age Pushkara * was holy ; in the third age the Plain of the Kurus was holy ; and in this age Ganges is holy " (iii. 85. 90).^ Besides Ganges, the Plain of the Kurus and Prayaga, the junction of Ganges and Jumna, get the highest laudation. Other rivers, such as the Gomal and Sarasvati, are also extolled, and
1 iii. 84. S3 (87. 1 1). We see the first idea in the injunction of Indra to ' wander,' as told in the tale of Dogstail in the Brahmana (see above). 2 The usual formula (also Avestan) is ' pure in thought, speech, and act.' The comparison of the six senses to unrestrained wild horses is familiar (iii. 211. 24). 3 There is, further, no unanimity in regard to the comparative value of holy places. In xii. 152. n, Sarasvati is holier than Kurukshetra, etc.
1 At Pushkara is Brahma's only (?) shrine — the account is legendary, but half historical. The modern shrine at Ajmir seems to be meant. 5 Ganges, according to epic legend, was a goddess who sacrificed herself for men when the earth was parched and men perished. Then Ganges alone of immortals took pity on men, and flinging herself from heaven became the stream divine. Her name among the gods is Alakananda, the ' Blessed Damosel.'



EARLY HINDUISM. 373
the list is very long of places which to see or to bathe in releases from sin. " He who bathes in Ganges purifies seven descend* ants.^ As long as the bones of a man touch Ganges-water so
long that man is magnified in heaven.'' Again ; " No place of pilgrimage is better than Ganges ; no god is better than Vishnu ;
nothing is better than brahtna — so said the sire of the gods " (iii. 85. 94-96). The very dust of Kuru-Plain makes one
holy, the sight of it purifies ; he that lives south of the Sarasvati, north of the Drishadvati {i.e., in Kuru-Plain), he lives in
the third heaven (iii. 83. 1-3 = 203-205 ^). This sort of expia^tion for sin is implied in a more general way by the remark that
there are three kinds of purity, one of speech, one of act, and
one of water (iii. 200. 82). But in the epic there is still
another means of expiating sin, one that is indicated in the Brahmahic rule that if a woman is an adultress she destroys half her sin by confessing it (as above), where, however, repentance is rather implied than commanded. But in the epic
Purana it is distinctly stated as a Cruti, or trite saying, fhat
if one repents he is freed from his sin ; na tat kurydm punar is the formula he must use, ' I will not do so again,' and then he is released from even the sin that he is going to commit a sec
ond time, as if by a ceremony — so is the Qruti in the laws,
dhannas (iii. 207. 51, 52).^ Confession to the family priest is
enjoined, in xii. 268. 14, to escape punishment.
1 In iii. 87. 10, " ten descendants and ten ancestors." The epic, i. 170. 19, regards tiie SarasvatI and Jumna as parts of the sevenfold Ganges, which descends from the heavens as these three, and also as the Vitastha (Rathastha), Sarayu, GomatT, and Gandaki ; being itself ' Vaitarani among the Manes.' So xii. 322. 32. 2 According to the commentator the " (northern altar of the Father-god) Kurukshetra-Samantapaiicakam, between Tarantuka, Arantuka, Ramahrada, and Macakruka,'' mentioned in iii. 83. 208, lies in Benares ; but this must l)e a late addition, as Kurukshetra's position is without doubt. Compare i. :;. i ff. ; ix. 53. 1, 23-25. 3 In ib. 47, viahd drtir ivWdhmdtah papas, there is an interesting reminiscence of liig Veda, vii. 89. 2. The rules of virtue are contained in Vedas and law-books, and the practice of instructed men, ii. 83 (the 'threefold sign of righteousness'). A (^ruti cited from dhai-mas is not uncommon, but the latter word is not properly used in so wide a sense. See note below, p. 378.



374 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Two other religious practices in the epic are noteworthy.
The first is the extension of idolatry in pictures. The amiable
'goddess of the house ' is represented, to be sure, as a Rakshasi, or demoniac power, whose name is Jara. But she was created
by the Self-existent, and is really very friendly, under certain
conditions : " Whoever delineates me with faith in his house,
he increases in children ; otherwise he would be destroyed." She is worshipped, i.e., her painted image is worshipped, with
perfumes, flowers, incense, food, and other enjoyable things
(ii. iS).'' Another practice that is very common is the worship of holy trees. One may compare the banyan at Bodhi Gaya with the 'worshipful' village-tree of ii. 24. 23. Seldom and late
is the use of a rosary mentioned (e.g., iii. 112. 5, akshamdla, elsewhere akshd), although the word is employed to make an epithet of Qiva, Akshamalin.^
As has been said already, an extraordinary power is ascribed to the mere repetition of a holy text, mantra. These are applied on all occasions without the slightest reference to the subject. By means of mantra one exorcises ; recovers weapons ; calls gods and demons, etc' When misfortune or disease arrives it is invariably ascribed to the malignant action' of a devil, although the karma teaching should suggest that it was the result of a former misdeed on the victim's part. But the very iteration, the insistence on new explanations of this doctrine, show that the popular mind still clung to the old idea of demoniac interference. Occasionally the naivete' with which the
1 Some scholars see in the use of the verb/«f, a Vedic picturing of gods ; but in all instances where this occurs it may be only the poet's mind-picture of the god ' adorned ' with various glories. 2 In vii. 201, 69, Qiva wears an akshamala. In xii. 38. 23, the Carvaka wears an aksha, for he is disguised as a bhikshu, beggar. 8 It must be remembered that the person using the mantra probably did not
understand what the words meant. The epic says, in fact, that the Vedas are
unintelligible: hahma fracuracchalam, xii. 329. 6. But an older generation
thought the same. In Nirukta, i. 15, Kautsa is cited as saying that the mantras
are meaningless.



EARLY HINDUISM. 375
effect of a mantra is narrated is somewhat amusing, as, for instance, wlien the heroine Krislina faints, and the by-standers " slowly " revive her " by the use of demon-dispelling mantras, rubbing, water, and fanning" (iii. 144. 17). All the weapons of the heroes are inspired with and impelled by mantras.
Sufficient insight into the formal rules of morality has
been given in the extracts above, nor does the epic in this regard differ much from the law-books. Every man's first duty
is to act, inactivity is sinful. The man that fails to win a good
reputation by his acts, a warrior, for example, that is devoid of
fame, a ' man of no account,' is a bhilmivardhana, a.)(9o^ apovprj^,
a cumberer of earth (iii. 35. 7). A proverb says that man should seek virtue, gain, and pleasure ; " virtue in the morning ; gain at noon ; pleasure at night," or, according to another version, " pleasure when young, gain in middle-age, and virtue
in the end of life" (iii. 33. 40,41). "Virtue is better than
immortality and life. Kingdom, sons, glory, wealth, all this
does not equal one-sixteenth part of the value of truth" (il>. 34. 22).^ One very strong summing up of a discourse on
virtuous behavior ends thus : " Truth, self-control, asceticism,
generosity, non-injury, constancy in virtue — these are the
means of success, not caste nor family " (j'dti, kula, iii. 181. 42).
A doctrine practiced, if not preached, is that" of bloodrevenge. " The unavenged shed tears, which are wiped away by the avenger" (iii. 11. 66); and in accordance with this feel
ing is the statement : " I shall satiate my brother with his
murderer's blood, and thus, becoming free of debt in respect of
my brother, I shall win the highest place in heaven " {ib. 34, 35).
As of old, despite the new faith, as a matter of priestly, formal belief, all depends on the sacrifice r " Law comes from usage ; in law are the Vedas established ; by means of the Vedas arise sacrifices ; by sacrifice are the gods established
;
1 Compare xii. 1 74. 46 : " The joy of earth and heaven obtained by the satisfaction of desire is not worth one-sixteenth of the bliss of dead desire."



376 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
according to the rule of Vedas, and usage, sacrifices being per
formed support the divinities, just as the rules of Brihaspati
and Uganas support men" (iii. 150. 28, 29). The pernicious doctrine of atonement for sin follows as a matter of course : " Whatver sin a king commits in conquering the earth is atoned
for by sacrifices, if they are accompanied with large gifts to
priests, such as cows and villages." Even gifts to a sacred
bull have the same effect (iii. 33. 78, 79 ; ib. 35. 34 ; iii. 2. 57), the occasion in hand being a king's violation of his oath.^ Of
these sacrifices a great snake-sacrifice forms the occasion for
narrating the whole epic, the plot of which turns on the national vice of gambling.^ For divine snakes are now even grouped with other celestial powers, disputing the victory of earthly combatants as do Indra and Surya : " The great snakes were
on Arjuna's side; the little snakes were for Kama" (viii. 87.
44, 4S).^ They were (perhaps) the local gods of the Nagas (Snakes), a tribe living between the Ganges and Jumna. The religion of the epic is multiform. But it stands, in a
certain sense, as one religion, and from two points of view it is
worthy of special regard. One may look upon it either as the summing up of Brahmanism in the new Hinduism, as the final expression of a religion which forgets nothing and absorbs everything ; or one may study it as a belief composed of historical
strata, endeavoring to divide it into its different layers, as they
1 By generosity the Hindu poet means 'to priests.' In iii. 200, where this is elaborated, sixteen persons are mentioned (vs. 4) to whom to give is not meritorious. 2 Little is known in regard to the play. The dice are thrown on a board, ' odd and even' determine tlie contest here (iii. 34. 5), ayitja a.nd yuja. At times speed in counting is the way to win (Nala). Dicing is a regular part of the rdjasuya sacrifice (Weber, p. 67), but not, apparently, an ancient trait. 3 The snakes belong to Varuna and his region, as described in v. 98. It is on the head of the earth-upholding snake ^esha that Vishnu muses, iii. 203. 12. The reverence paid to serpents begins to be ritual in the Atharva Veda. Even in the Rig Veda there is the deification of the cloud-snake. In later times they answered to the Nymphs, being tutelary guardians of streams and rivers (Biihler). In i. 36, Qesha Ananta supports earth, and it is told why he does so.



EARLY HINDUISM. 377
have been super-imposed one upon another in the course of ages. From the latter point of view the Vedic divinities claim
the attention first. There are still traces of the original power of Agni and Surya, as we have shown, and Wind still makes with these two a notable triad,^ whereas Indra, impotent as he
is, hymnless as he is, — save in the oldest portions of the work, still leads the gods, now godkins, of the ancient pantheon, and
still, in theory, at least, offers a paradise to the knight that dies
nobly on the field. ^ But one sees at once that the preserva
tion of the dignity of these deities is due to different causes. Indra cannot even save a snake that grasps his hand for safety ; he wages war against the demons' ' triple town,' and signally
fails of his purpose, for the demons are as strong as the gods, and there are Danavendras as well as Danavarshis.^ But Indra is the figure-head of the whole ancient pantheon, and
for this reason he plays so constant, if so weak, a role, in the epic. The only important thing in connection with him is his
heaven. As an individual deity Indra lives, on the whole, only in the tales of old, for example, in that of his cheating Namuci
(ix. 43. 32 ff.). Nothing new and clever is told of him which would indicate power, only a new trick or two, as when he steals from Kama. It is quite otherwise with Agni and Surya. They are not so vaguely identified with the one god as is ' Indra and the other Vasus.' It is merely because these gods are prominently forms of Vishnu that they are honored with hymns in the epic. This is seen from the nature of the hymns, and also from the fact that it is either as fire or as sun that Vishnu destroys at the end of the aeons. For it is, perhaps, somewhat daring to say, and yet it seems to
be the fact, that the solar origin of Vishnu is not lost sight of.
1 These three are the witnesses for the soul at the judgment, xii. 322. 55. Vayu, Wind, is said to be even mightier than Indra, Yama, Indra and Varuna, ib. 155. 9, 10. 2 But (in a later account) not if he dies ignobly ; for if one is slain by a man of low caste he goes to hell, xii. 298. 7. 8 Demoniac Indras {i£., demon-leaders) and seers, xii. 166. 26.



378 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The pantheistic Vishnu is the atma, and Vishnu, after all, is but a form of fire. Therefore is it that the epic Vishnu is per
petually lapsing into fire ; while fire and sun are doubly hon
ored as special forms of the highest. It is, then, not so much
on account of a survival of ancient dignity-' that sun and fire stand so high, but rather because they are the nearest approach to the effulgence of the Supreme. Thus while in one place one is told that after seven suns have appeared the supreme gods become the fire of destruction and complete the ruin, in another hs reads that it is the sun alone which, becoming twelvefold, does all the work of the Supreme.^ Indra has hymns and sacrifices, but although he has no so
exalted hymn as comes to his ' friend Agni,' yet (in an isolated passage) he has a new feast and celebration, the account of which apparently belongs to the first period of the epic, when the worship of Indra still had significance. In i. 63, an Indra
maka, or ' glorification of Indra,' is described a festivity extending over two days, and marked by the erection of a pole in
honor of the god — a ceremony which 'even to-day,' it is said,
is practiced.* The old tales of the fire-cult are retold, and ne'w rites are known.* Thus in iii. 251. 20 £f.. Prince Duryodhana resolves to starve to death (oblivious of the rule that ' a suicide
goes to hell '), and since this is a religious ceremony, he clothes
himself in old clothes and holy-grass, 'touches water,' and

' The god of gods,' who rains blood in i. 30. 36, is declared by the commentator
to be — Parjanya! The gods are here defending Soma from the heavenly bird, Garuda, and nearly die of fright. 2 xii. 313. j-7, with the same watery finale as is usual. 8 The morning prayer, etc., to the sun is, of course, still observed, e.g.^ vii, 186. 4. Indra is thanked for victory and invoked for rain (iii. 117. ii ; i. 25. 7 ; Holtzmann, loc. cit. p. 326) in an hymn that is less fulsome than those to Agni and Surya. 4 iii. 222, Atharvan's rediscovery of fire.

EARLY HINDUISM. 379
devotes himself with intense application to heaven. Then the devils of Rudra called Daiteyas and Danavas, who live underground ever since they were conquered by the gods, aided by priests, make a fire-rite, and with manti-as " declared by Brihaspati and Uganas, and proclaimed in the Atharva-Veda," raise
a ghost or spirit, who is orflered to fetch Duryodhana to hell, which she immediately does.^ The frequent connection of Brihaspati with the Atharva-Veda is of interest (above, p. 159). He is quite a venerable, if not wholly orthodox, author in the
epic, and his ' rules ' are often cited.'' That Vedic deity who, alone of pre-Vedic powers, still holds
his proud place, Yama, the king of departed spirits, varies in the epic according to the period represented. In old tales he is still quite Vedic in character ; he takes the dead man's soul
off to his own realm. But, of course, as pantheism prevails, and eschatology becomes confused, Yama passes into a shadow, and at most is a bugbear for the wicked. Even his companions are stolen from another realm, and one hears now of " King Yama with his Rudras " (iii. 237. 11),^ while it is only the
bad'* that go to Yama (iii. 200. 24), in popular belief, although
this view, itself old, relapses occasionally into one still older, in accordance with which (ib. 49) all the world is hounded on by Yama's messengers, and comes to his abode. His home ^ in the south is now located as being at a distance of 86,000
1 The devils are on the Prince's side, and wish to Iceep him from death. The proverb is found ib. 252. 2 ; dtmatyagi hy ad/to ydti. The holy-grass is used in much the same way when Rama lies down by Ocean, resolved to die or persuade Ocean to aid him. The rites (vs. 24) are " in the Upanishad." 2 According to xii. 59. 80-S4, the ' treatise of Brihaspati ' comes from (Jiva through Brahma and Indra. 8 In Buddhism Yama's messengers are Yakkhas. Scherman, loc. cit. p. 57. 4 Compare ii. 22, 26 : gacr.ha yamaksnyam, ' go to Yama's destruction ' ; whereas of a good man it is said, 'I will send Indra a guest' (vii. 27. 8). 6 Yamasya sadana. iii. 11. 66. He now has hells, and he it is who will destroy the world. He is called 'the beautiful' (iii. 41. 9), so that he must, if one take this Rudrian epithet with the citation above, be loosely (popularly) identified with Q^iva, as god of death. See the second note below.



380 THE RELTCIONS OF INDIA.
leagues over a terrible road, on which passes a procession of wretched or happy mortals, even as they have behaved during life ; for example, if one has generously given an umbrella during life he will have an umbrella on this journey, etc. The river in Yama's abode is called Pushpodaka, and what each drinks out of it is according to what he deserves to drink, cool
water or filth {ib. 46, 58).^ In the various descriptions it is
not strange to find discordant views even in portions belonging approximately to the same period. Thus in contradistinction to the prevailing view one reads of Indra himself that he is Yamasya neta Namucegca hanta, 'Yama's leader, Namuci's
slayer' (iii. 25. 10), i.e., those that die in battle go to Yama.
On the other hand, in the later speculative portions, Yama
is not death. " Yama is not death, as some think ; he is one that gives bliss to the good, and woe to the bad." ^ Death and
life are foolishness and lack of folly, respectively (literally, ' non
folly is non-mortality'), while folly and mortality are counter
opposites. In pantheistic teaching there is, of course, no real
death, only change. But death is a female power, personified,
and sharply distinguished from Yama. Death as a means of change thus remains, while Yama is relegated to the guardian
ship of hell. The difference in regard to the latter subject, between earlier and later views, has been noted above. One comparatively early passage attempts to arrange the incongru
ous beliefs in regard to samsara (re-birth) and hell on a sort of
1 The old story of a mortal's visit to Yama to learn about life hereafter ( (^at, Br. xi. 6. I ; Katha tip., of Naciketas) is repeated in xiii. 71. 2 V. 42. 6 : Qvah ^ivn;iam a^h'O ^^ivandm (compare xii. 187. 27 : ' only fools say that the man is dead'). Dharma (Justice) seems at times to be the same with Yama. Mandavya goes to Dharma's sadana, home (compare Yama's sadand). just as one goes to Yama's, and interviews him on the ji stice of his judgments. As result of the angry interview the god is reborn on earth as a man of low caste, and the law is established that a child is not morally responsible for his acts till the twelfth year of his age (i. 108. 8 ff.). When Ruru agrees to give half his life in order to the restoration of Pramadvara, his wife, they go not to Yama but to Dharma to see if the exchange may be made, and he agrees (1. 9. 11 ff., a masculine Savitri !).



EARLY HINDUISM. 381
sliding scale, thus : " One that does good gets in the next life a
good birth ; one that does ill gets an ill birth "; more particu
larly : "By good acts one attains to the state of gods; by
' mixed ' acts, to the state of man ; by acts due to confusion of
mind, to the state of animals and plants (viyonisu) ; by sinful acts one goes to hell" (adhogamt, iii. 209. 29-32).^ Virtue
must have been, as the epic often declares it to be, a ' subtile
matter,' for often a tale is told to illustrate the fact that one
goes to hell for doing what he thinks (mistakenly) to be right. Thus Kau^ika is sent to hell for speaking the truth, whereas
he ought to have lied to save life (viii. 69. 53), for he was
"ignorant of virtue's subtilty." ^ A passage (i. 74. 27 ff.) that
is reflected in Manu (viii. 85-86) says that Yama Vaivasvata takes away the sin of him with whom is satisfied " the one that witnesses the act, that stands in the heart, that knows the ground "; but Yama tortures him with whom this one (personified conscience) is dissatisfied. For "truth is equal to a
thousand horse-sacrifices; truth is highest brahma" (ib. 103,
106). Following downward the course of religious development, as
reflected in the epic, one next finds traces of Brahmanic theology not only in the few passages where (Brahma) Prajapati remains untouched by sectarianism, but also in the harking back to old formulae. Thus the insistence on the Brahmanical sacredness of the number seventeen is preserved (xii. 269. 26 ; iii. 210. 20, etc.); and Upanishadic is the "food is Prajapati"
of iii. 200. 38 (Yama in 40). There is an interesting rehabili
tation of the primitive idea of the A^vins in the new ascription
of formal divinity to the (personified) Twilights (Sandhya) in iii. 200. 83, although this whole passage is more Puranic than
1 The hells are described in xii. 322. 29 ff. The sight of 'golden trees' presages death (ib. 44). 2 The ordinary rule is that " no sin is greater than untruth," xii. 162. 24, modified by "save in love and danger of life'" {"Layis, passim).



382 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
epic. From the same source is the doctrine that the fruit of action expires at the end of one liundred thousand kalpas
(ib. vs. i2i). One of the oddest religious freaks in the epic is the sudden exaltation of the Ribhus, the Vedic (season-gods)
artisans, to the position of highest gods. In that heaven of Brahma, which is above the Vedic gods' heaven, there are the
holy seers and the Ribhus, 'the divinities of the gods'; who do not change with the change of kalpas (as do other Vedic gods), iii. 261. 19-23. One might almost imagine that their threefoldness was causative of a trinitarian identification with
a supreme triad; but no, for still higher is the 'heaven of Vishnu ' (vs. 37). The contrast is marked between this and Ait. Br. iii. 30, where the Ribhus with some difficulty obtain
the right to drink soma. There is an aspect of the epic religion upon which it is necessary to touch before treating of the sectarian development. In the early philosophical period wise priests meet together to
discuss theological and philosophical questions, often aided,
and often brought to grief, by the wit of women disputants, who are freely admitted to hear and share in the discussion. When, however, pantheism, nay, even Vishnuism, or still more, Krishnaism, was an accepted fact upon what, then, was the wisdom of the priest expended ? Apart from the epic, the best intellects of the day were occupied in researches, codifying laws, and solving, in rather dogmatic fashion, philosophical
(theological) problems. The epic presents pictures of scenes which seem to be a reflection from an earlier day. But one sees often that the wisdom is commonplace, or even silly. In dialectics a sophistical subtlety is. shown ; in codifying moral
rules, a tedious triteness ; in amoebic passes of wit there are
astounding exhibitions, in which the good scholiast sees treasures of wisdom, where a modern is obliged to take them in their literal dulness. Thus in iii. 132. 18, a boy of twelve or
ten (133. 16), who is divinely precocious, defeats the wise men



EARLY HINDUISM. 3S3
in disputation at a sacrifice, and in the following section
(134. 7 ff.) silences a disputant who is regarded as one of the
cleverest priests. The conversation is recorded in full. In what does it consist? The opponent mentions a number of things which are one ; the boy replies with a verse that gives
pairs of things ; the other mentions triads ; the child cites groups of fours, etc., until the opponent, haviag cited only one
half-verse of thirteens, can remember no more and stops, on which the child completes the verse, and is declared winner. The conundrums which precede must have been considered very witty, for they are repeated elsewhere : What is that wheel which has twelve parts and three hundred and sixty spokes, etc. ? Year. What does not close its eye when asleep, what does not move when it is born, what has no heart, what increases by moving ? These questions form one-half verse.
The next half-verse gives the answers in order : fish, egg, stone, river. This wisdom in the form of puzzles and answers, brahmodya, is very old, and goes back to the Vedic period. Another good case in the epic is the demon Yaksha and the captured king, who is not freed till he answers certain questions
correctly.^ But although a certain amount of theologic lore may be gleaned from these questions, yet is it of greater inter
est to see how the priests discussed when left quietly to their own devices. And a very natural description of such a scene
is extant. The priests "having some leisure"^ or vacation
from their labors iii the king's house, sit down to argue, and
the poet calls their discussion viiandd, i.e., tricky sophistical
argumentation, the description bearing out the justness of the
phrase : " One cried, ' that is so,' and the other, ' it is not so ';
one cried, ' and that is so,' and the other, ' it must be so '; and
1 The same scenes occur in Buddhistic writings, where Yakkhas ask conundrums. For example, in the Hemavatasidta and Alavakasiitta the Yakkha asks what is the best possession, what brings bliss, and what is sweetest, to which the answer is : faith, law, and truth, respectively. 2 Karmdntaram ufasantas, i.e., virdmakalam ufagacchanias.



384 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
some by arguments made weak arguments strong, and strong weak ; while some wise ones were always swooping down on their opponent's arguments, like hawks on meat." ^ In iii. 2. 15,
the type of clever priest is 'skilled in Yoga and Safikhya,' who
inculcates renunciation. This sage teaches that mental diseases are cured by Yoga ; bodily, by medicine ; and that desire is the
root of ill.
But by far the most interesting theological discussion in the epic, if one except the Divine Song, is the conversation of the hero and heroine in regard to the cause of earthly happiness. This discussion is an old passage of the epic. The very fact that a woman is the disputant gives an archaic effect to the narration, and reminds one of the scenes in the Upanishads, where learned women cope successfully with men in displays
of theological acumen. Furthermore, the theological position taken, the absence of Vishnuism, the appeal to the ' Creator
'
as the highest Power, take one back to a former age. The doctrine of special grace, which crops out in the Upanishads,^ here receives its exposure by a sudden claim that the converse of the' theory must also be true, viz., that to those not saved by
grace and election God is as cruel as He is kind to the elect. The situation is as follows : The king and queen have been basely robbed of their kingdom, and are in exile. The queen urges the king to break the vow of exile that has been forced from him, and to take vengeance on their oppressors. The king, in reply, sings a song of forgiveness: "Forgiveness is
virtue, sacrifice, Veda ; forgiveness is holiness and truth ; in the world of Brahma are the mansions of them that forgive." This song (iii. 29. 36 ff.) only irritates the queen, who at once
launches into the following interesting tirade (30. i ff.) : " Rev
1 ii. 36. 3 ff. The phraseology of vs. 5 is exactly that of rhv t\ttoi '\liyov KpdrTia TTOiovcn, but the Pundit's arguments are ' based on the law.' 2 See above. In a later period (see below) the question arises in regard to the part played by Creator and individual in the workings of grace, some claiming that man was passive ; some, that he had to strive for grace.



EARLY HINDUISM. 385
erence to the. Creator and Disposer ^ who have confused thy mind ! Hast thou not worshipped with salutation and honored the priests, gods, and manes ? Hast thou not made horse
sacrifices, the rayfl'.f?y'a-sacrifice, sacrifices of every sort (^piinda
rlka^ gosava) ? Yet art thou in this miserable plight ! Verily
is it an old story (itihasa) that 'the worlds stand under the Lord's will.' Following the seed God gives good or ill in the case of all beings. Men are all moved by the divinity. Like a wooden doll, moving its limbs in the hands of a man, so do all
creatures move in the Creator's hands. Man is like a bird on
a string, like a bead on a cord. As a bull is led by the nose, so
man follows the will of the Creator ; he never is a creature of free will (atmadhmd). Every man goes to heaven or to hell, as he is sent by the Lord's will. God himself, occupied with noble or with wicked acts, moves about among all created things, an unknown power (not known as 'this one'). The blessed God, who is self-created, the great forefather (^prapitdmahd), plays
with his creatures just as a boy plays with toys, putting them together and destroying them as he chooses. Not like a father is God to His creatures ; He acts in anger. When I see the good distressed, the ignoble happy, I blame the Creator who permits this inequality. What reward does God get that he sends happiness to this sinful man (thy oppressor) ? If it be
true that only the individual that does the act is pursued by the fruit of that act {karma doctrine) then the Lord who has done
this act is defiled by this base act of His. If, on the other hand, the act that one has done does not pursue and overtake the one that has done it, then the only agency on earth is brute
force (this is the only power to be respected) — and I grieve
for them that are without it !
"
1 Perhaps ironical. In v. 175. 32, a woman cries out ; " Fie on the Creator for this bad luck," conservative in belief, and outspoken in word. 2 iii. 30. 1 7. The gosava is a ' cow-sacrifice.' The ptmdanka is not explained (perhaps 'elephant-sacrifice').



386 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
To this plea, which in its acknowledgment of the Creator as the highest god, no less than in its doubtful admission of the
karma doctrine, is of peculiar interest, the king replies with a refutation no less worthy of regard : " Thy argument is good,
clear and smooth, but it is heterodox {iiastikyam). I have sacrificed and practiced virtue not for the sake of reward, but
because it was right. I give what I ought to give, and sacrifice as I should. That is my only idea in connection with rehgious
observances. There is no virtue in trying to milk virtue. Do not doubt. Do not be suspicious of virtue. He that doubts
God or duty goes to hell (confusion), but he that does his duty and is free from doubt goes to heaven (becomes immortal).
Doubt not scriptural authority. Duty is the saving ship. No other gets to heaven. Blame not the Lord Creator, who is the
highest god. Through His grace the faithful gets immortality. If religious observances were without fruit the universe would go to destruction. People would not have been good for so many ages if there had been no reward for it. This is a mystery of the gods. The gods are full of mystery and
illusion."
The queen, for all the world like that wise woman in the Upanishads, whose argument, as we showed in a preceding chapter, is cut short not by counter-argument, but by the threat that if she ask too much her head will fall off, recants her
errors at this rebuke,' and in the following section, which evidently is a later addition, takes back what she has said. Her
new expression of belief she cites as the opinion of Brihaspati
(32. 61, 62); but this is applicable rather to her first creed of
doubt. Perhaps in the original version this authority was
cited at the end of the first speech, and with the interpolation the reference is made to apply to this seer. Something like the queen's remarks is the doubtful saying of the king himself, as quoted elsewhere (iii. 273. 6): "Time and fate,
and what will be, this is the only Lord. How else could



EARLY HINDUISM. 387
this distress have come upon my wife ? For she has been virtuous always."
We turn now to the great sectarian gods, who eventually unite
with Brahma to form a pantheistic trinity, a conception which, as we shall show, is not older than the fifth or sixth century
after Christ.



CHAPTER XV.
HINDUISM (CONTINUED). — VISHNU AND CIVA.
In the epic the later union of the sectarian gods is still a
novelty. The two characters remain distinct enough. Vishnu
and Qiva are different gods. But each in turn represents the All-god, and consequently each represents the other. The Vishnu-worship which grew about Krishna, originally a friend
of one of the epic characters, was probably at first an attempt to
foist upon Vedic believers a sectarian god, by identifying the
latter with a Vedic divinity. But, whatever the origin, Krishna as Vishnu is revered as the All-god in the epic. And, on the other hand, Qiva of many names has kept the marks of Rudra. Sometimes one, sometimes another, is taken as the All-god. At times they are compared, and then each sect reduces the
god of the other to an inferior position. Again they are united
and regarded as one. The Vishnu side has left the best literary representation of this religion, which has permeated the epic. It is pantheism, but not an impersonal pantheism. The Blessed Lord is the All. This is the simple base and crown of its speculation. It is like the personal development of Vedantic philosophy, only it is here degraded by the personality of the man-god, who is made the incarnate All-god. The Krishna of the epic as a man is a sly, unscrupulous fellow, continually suggesting and executing acts that are at variance with the knightly code of honor. He is king of Dvaraka and ally of the epic heroes. But again, he is divine, the highest divinity, the avatar of the All-god Vishnu. The sectaries that see in Qiva rather than in Vishnu the one and only god, have no such representative to which to refer. For Qiva, as the historical
descendant of the Vedic Rudra, — although even in his case



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 389
there is an intrusion of local worship upon an older Vedic be
lief, — represents a terror-god, either the lightning, the fairest of
the gods, or, when -he appears on earth, a divine horror, or, again, " a very handsome young man." ^ These two religions, of Vishnu as Krishna and of Qiva alone, are not so much united in the epic as they are super-imposed upon the older worship of Brahma, and, indeed, in such a way that Qiva-worship, in a pantheistic sense, appears to be the latest of the
three beliefs that have influenced the story.'' The personal pantheism of the older Vishnuism has in its form and teachings so close a resemblance to the Christian
religion that it has always had a great attraction for occidental readers; while the real power of its "Divine Song" gives the
latter a charm possessed by few of the scriptures of India. This Divine Song (or Song of the Blessed One) is at present a Krishnaite version of an older Vishnuite poem, and this in turn was at first an unsectarian work, perhaps a late Upanishad. It is accepted by Vishnuites as a kind of New Testament ; and with the New Testament it has in truth much in common. It must be pointed out at the outset that there is here the closest connection with the later Upanishads. The verse, like that of the Katha Upanishad (quoted above), which stands almost at
the beginning of the Song, is typical of the relation of the Song to the Upanishad. It will be noticed how the impersonal 'That,' i.e., absolute being, brahma, changes almost at once to the personal He (atma as Lord). As shows the whole Song, brahma throughout is understood to be personal.^
1 He appears in different complete manifestations, wliile Vislinu appears only in part, as a ' descent,' avatar^ i.e,^ Vishnu is incarnate, (^iva appears whole. 2 The original story perhaps antedates the Brahmanic Brahma. But, for all one knows, when the poem was first written Brahma was already decadent as chief god. In that case two strata of religious belief have been formally super-imposed, Vishnuism and C^ivaism, 3 While agreeing with Telang that the original GTta is an old poem, we cannot subscribe to his argument (SBE. viii. p. 19) that the priority of the Saman over the Rig Veda is evidence of antiquity; still less to the argument, p. 21, from the castes.



390 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
To understand the religion which reaches its culmination in the epic no better course could be pursued than to study the whole of the Divine Song. It is, however, too long a production to be introduced here in its entirety ; but the following extracts
give the chief features of the work, than which nothing in
Hindu literature is more characteristic, in its sublimity as in its
puerilities, in its logic as in its want of it. It has shared the
fate of most Hindu works in being interpolated injudiciously, so that many of the puzzling anomalies, which astound no less the reader than the hero to whom it was revealed, are probably
later additions. It is a medley of beliefs as to the relation of spirit and matter, and other secondary matters ; it is uncertain
in its tone in regard to the comparative efficacy of action and
inaction, and in regard to the practical man's means of salvation ;
but it is at one with itself in its fundamental thesis, that all
things are each a part of One Lord, that men and gods are but manifestations of the One Divine Spirit, which, or rather whom, the Vishnuite re-writer identifies with Krishna, as Vishnu's present form. The Divine Song, as it is revealed in the epic by Vishnu (-Krishna) to his favorite knight, Arjuna, begins thus : "Know
that the ' That ' in which is comprised the ' This ' is indestructible. These bodies of the indestructible Eternal One have an end : but whoso knows Him as slayer, and whoso thinks Him to be slain, these two have not true wisdom. He slays not and is not slain. He is not born, he does not die at any time ; nor will He, having been born, cease to be. Unborn, everlasting, eternal. He, the Ancient One, is not slain when the body is slain. As one puts away an old garment and puts on another that is new, so He, the embodied (Spirit), puts away the old
body and assumes one that is new. Everlasting, omnipresent.
The caste-position of tlie priest in the GJta is owing to the religious exaltation of the poem ; and the precedence of Saman is not unusual in the latest portions of the epic (see below).



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 391
firm, unchanging is He, the Eternal; indiscernible is He called, inconceivable, unchangeable." ^
The Song now turns into a plea that the warrior who is hearing it should, as one born to be a soldier, be brave and fight,
lest his sorrow for the slain be taken for fear ; since "nothing is better for a warrior than a just fight," and "loss of fame is worse
than death." Then follows (with the usual inconsequential 'heaven') "If thou art slain thou wilt obtain heaven, and if
thou art victorious thou shalt enjoy earth ; therefore, careless
of pleasure and pain, get ready for the fight, and so thou wilt not incur sin. This is the knowledge declared in the Sankhya
;
hear now that of the Yoga," and the Divine Lord proceeds : " Some are pleased with Vedic words and think that there is
nothing else ; their souls are full of desires ; and they think that going to heaven is the chief thing. Yet have the Vedas refer
ence only to the three qualities (of which all things partake).
Be free from the three qualities (do not care for rewards). In
action, not in fruit, is the chief thing. Do thy work, abiding
by serene devotion (Yoga), rejecting every tie ; be indifferent
fo success and failure. Serene devotion is called indifference (to such things). Action is lower than devotion of mind. Devotion is happiness. Do thou, wise in devotion, abandon the fruit that is sprung from action, and, freed from the bonds
of birth, attain a perfect state." Sankhya here means the philosophy of religion ; Yoga is the
philosophical state of mind, serene indifference, religious sang
froid, the practical result of a belief in the Sankhya doctrine
of the indestructibility of the spirit. In the following there is
Vedantic teaching, as well as Sankhyan in the stricter sense.
On the warrior's asking for an explanation of this state of
equipoise, the Deity gives illustrations of the balanced mind that is free from all attachments, serene, emancipated from de
1 Compare Manu, i. 7 : " He the subtile, indiscernible, eternal, inconceivable One, who makes all creatures."



392 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sires, self-controlled, and perfectly tranquil. As the knight is
astonished and confused at the contradiction, action and inactivity both being urged upon him, the Deity replies that there
is a twofold law, that of Sankhyas consisting in knowledge
devotion, and that of Yogis in action-devotion. Idleness is not freedom from action. Freedom from attachment must be united with the accomplishment of such acts as should be performed. The deluded think that they themselves perform acts, but acts are not done by the spirit (self) ; they are done only
by nature's qualities (this is Sankhya doctrine). "One should know the relation between the individual and Supreme Spirit, and with tranquil mind perform good acts. Let the deluded ones be, who are erroneously attached to action. The wise man should not cause those of imperfect knowledge to be unsettled in their faith, but he should himself not be attached to action. Each man should perform his own (caste) duties. One's own duty ill done is better than doing well another man's work." The knight now asks what causes one to sin. The Deity answers: "Love and hate; for from love is born hate ; and from anger, ignorance in regard to right and wrong; whence
comes lack of reason, and consequently destruction. The knowledge of a man is enwrapped with desire as is fire with smoke. Great are the senses ; greater, the mind ; greater still, the understanding; greatest of all is 'That'" {brahma; as above in the Chdndogyd). The Deity begins again : ^ "This system of devotion I declared to Vivasvant (the sun) ; Vivasvant declared it to" Manu, and Manu to kingly seers.'' (The same origin is claimed for itself in Manu's lawbook.) The knight objects, not yet knowing that Krishna is the AU-god : "How
did'st thou declare it first ? thy birth is later than the sun's." To whom the Deity: "Many are my births, and I know them all ; many too are thine, but thou knowest them not ; unborn and Lord of all creatures I assume phenomena, and am

HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 393
born by the illusion of the spirit. Whenever there is lack of
righteousness, and wrong arises, then I emit (create) myself.'
I am born age after age for the protection of the good, for the
destruction of the wicked, and for the sake of establishing
righteousness. Whoso really believes in this my divine birth and work, he, when he has abandoned his body, enters no second birth, but enters Me. Many there are who, from Me arising, on Me relying, purified by the penance of knowledge, with
all affections, fear, and anger gone, enter into my being. As they approach Me so I serve them.^ Men in all ways follow
after my path. Some desire the success that is of action, and worship gods ; for success that is born of action is speedy in the world of men. Know Me as the maker of the four castes, know Me as the unending one and not the maker. Action
stains Me not, for in the fruit of action I have no desire. He that thus knows Me is not bound by acts.^ So he that has no attachment is not bound by acts. His acts become naught. Bf-ahma is the oblation, and with brahma is it offered ; brahma is in the fire, and by brahma is the oblation made. Sacrifices
are of many kinds, but he that sacrifices with knowledge offers
the best sacrifice He that has faith has knowledge ; he that has knowledge obtains peace. He that has no knowledge and no faith, whose soul is one of doubt, is destroyed. Action does not destroy him that has renounced action by means of indifference. Of the two, renunciation of action and indifference,
though both give bliss, indifference in action is better than renunciation of action. Children, not Pundits, proclaim Sankhya
and Yoga to be distinct. He that is devoted to either alone
1 The avatars of Vishnu are meant. The very knight to whom lie speaks is later regarded (in South India) as incarnate god, and to-day is worshipped as an avatar of Vishnu. The idea of the 'birth-stories' of the Buddhists is thought by some scholars to have been connected historically with the avatars of Vishnu. - This is one of the notes struck in the later Upanishads, the doctrine of 'special grace,' originating perhaps still earlier in the Vac hymn (see above). 8 That is, one that also has no desires may act (without desiring the fruit of action.)



394 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
finds the reward of both. Renunciation without Yoga is a thing hard to get ; united with Yoga the seer enters brahma. . . . He is the renouncer and the devotee who does the acts that ought to be done without relying on the reward of action, not he that performs no acts and builds no sacrificial fires.
Through his self (spirit) let one raise one's self. Conquer self
by self (spirit). He is the best man who is indifferent to exter
nal things, who with equal mind sees (his spirit) self in every
thing and everything in self (God as the Spirit). Such an one obtains the highest bliss, brahma. Whoso sees Me in all and all in Me I am not destroyed for him, and he is not destroyed for Me." The knight now asks how it fares with a good man who is not equal to the discipline of Yoga, and cannot free himself
entirely from attachment. Does he go to destruction like a
cloud that is rent, failing on the path that leads to brahma ? The Deity replies: "Neither in this world nor in the beyond is he destroyed. He that acts virtuously does not enter an evil state. He obtains the heaven that belongs to the doers of
good, and after living there countless summers is reborn on earth in the family of pure and renowned men, or of pious devotees. There he receives the knowledge he had in a former body, and then strives further for perfection. After many births he reaches perfection and the highest course (union with brahma). There are but few that strive for perfection, and of them only one here and there truly knows Me. Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, understanding, and egoism
(self-consciousness) — so is my nature divided into eight
parts."^ But learn now my higher nature, for this is my lower one.
My higher nature is alive, and by it this world is supported. I am the creator and destroyer of all the world. Higher than I is nothing. On Me the universe is woven like pearls upon a thread. Taste am I, light am I of moon and sun, the

mystic syllable 07n {aiim), sound in space, manliness in men; I am smell and radiance; I am life and heat. Know Me as the eternal seed of all beings. I am the understanding of them that have understanding, the radiance of the radiant ones. Of
the strong I am the force, devoid of love and passion; and I am l.ove, not opposed to virtue. Know all beings to be from Me alone, whether they have the quality of goodness, of pas
sion, or of darkness (the three ' qualities ' or conditions of all
things). I am not in them; but they are in Me. Me, the inexhaustible, beyond them, the world knows not, for it is confused by these three qualities (conditions); and hard to overcome is the divine illusion which envelops Me, while it arises from the qualities. Only they pass through this illusion who come to Me alone. Wicked men, whose knowledge is taken away
by illusion, relying on a devilish (demoniac) condition, do not come to Me. They that have not the highest knowledge worship various divinities ; but whatever be the form that any one worships with faith I make his faith steady. He obtains his desires in worshipping that divinity, although they are really bestowed upon him by Me.'' But the fruit of these men,
in that they have little wisdom, has its end. He that sacrifices to (lesser) gods goes to those gods; but they that worship Me come to Me. I know the things that were, that are, and are to be ; but Me no one knoweth, for I am enveloped in illusion. I am the supreme being, the supreme godhead, the supreme
sacrifice, the Supreme Spirit, brahma." The knight asks " What is brahma, the Supreme Spirit, the supreme being, the supreme sacrifice?" The Deity: "The supreme, the indestructible, is called brahma. Its personal ex
istence is Supreme Spirit (self). Destructible existence is

396 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
supreme being (all except atma). The Person is the supreme godhead. I myself am the supreme sacrifice in this body.''
Then follow statements like those in the Upanishads and in Manu, describing a day of brahma as a thousand ages; worlds are renewed; they that go to the gods find an end of their happiness with the end of their world; but they that go to the
indestructible brahma, the Deity, the entity that is not de
stroyed when all else is destroyed, never again return. There are two roads (as in the Upanishads above), one, the northern road leading to brahma; one, the southern road to the moon, leading back to earth. At the end of a period of time all
beings reenter the divine nature (Prakriti'), and at the beginning of the next period the Deity emits them again and again
(they being without volition) by the volition of his nature. " Through Me, who am the superintendent, nature gives birth to
all things, and for that cause the world turns about. They of demoniac nature recognize me not ; they of god-like nature, knowing Me as the inexhaustible source, worship Me. I am the universal Father, the Vedas, the goal, the upholder, the Lord, the superintendent, the home, the asylum, the
friend. I am the inexhaustible seed. I am immortality
and death. I am being and not-being. I am the sacri
fice and he that offers it. Even they that, with faith, sacri
fice to other gods, even they (really) sacrifice to Me. To them that ever are devout and worship Me with love (faith), I give the attainment of the knowledge by which they come to
Me " (again the doctrine of special grace). " I am the begin
ning, the middle, and the end of all created things. I am Vishnu among sun-gods; the moon among the stars; Indra among the (Vedic) gods; the Saman among the Vedas; among
1 Prakriti {prakrti), nature ; the term belongs to the Sankhya philosophy, which recognizes nature as distinct from spirit, a. duality, opposed to advaita the non-duality of the Vedanta system, where the Sankhya ' nature ' is represented by mSya, ' illusion.' Otherwise the word Prakrit is the ' natural,' vulgar dialect, opposed to Sanskrit, the refined, ' put-together ' language.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 397
the senses, mind; among created beings, consciousness; among the Rudras I am Qiva (Qankara); among army-leaders I am Skanda; among the great sages I am Bhrigu (who reveals Manu's code) ; among the Siddhas ' I am Kapila the Muni. . . . I am the love that begets; I am the chief (Vasuki and Ananta) among the serpents ; and among them that live in water I am Varuna; among the Manes I am Aryaman; and I am Yama among controllers ; ^ among demons I am Prahlada . . . ; I am Rama; I am the Ganges. I am among all sciences the highest science (that in regard to the Supreme Spirit) ; I am the word of the speakers; I am the letter A among the letters, and the compound of union among the compounds.^ I am indestructi
ble time and I am the Creator. I am the death that seizes all
and I am the origin of things to be. I am glory, fortune, speech, memory, wisdom, constancy, and mercy. ... I am the punishment of the punisher and the polity of them that would win victory. I am silence. I am knowledge. There is no
end of my divine manifestations." The knight now asks to see the real form of the deity, which was revealed to him. " If in heaven the glory of a thousand suns should appear at once, such would be his glory." After this comes the real animus of the Divine Song in its present shape. The believer that has faith in this Vishnu is even better than the devotee who finds brahma by knowledge. The philosophy of knowledge (which here is anything but
Vedantic) is now communicated to the knight, in the course of
which the distinction between nature and spirit is explained:
" Nature, Prakriti, and spirit, Purusha (person), are both without beginning. All changes and qualities spring from nature. Na
ture is said to be the cause of the body's and the senses' activ
ity. Spirit is the cause of enjoyment (appreciation) of pleasure
1 Saints, literally ' the successful ones.' 2 Alluding to the later derivation of Yama from yam, control. 8 "The letter A," as in the Upanishads (see above, p. 226).



39S THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
and pain ; for the Spirit, standing in nature, appreciates the
nature-born qualities. The cause of the Spirit's re-birth is its
connection with the qualities. (This is Sankhya doctrine, and
tire same with that propounded above in regard to activity.) The Supreme Spirit is the Support and great Lord of all, the atmd, while hrahma (=prakriti) is the womb in which I
place My seed, and from that is the origin of all things. Tlie great brahma is the womb, and I am the seed-giving father of all the forms which come into being. The three
' qualities ' (conditions, attributes), goodness, passion, and darkness, are born of nature and bind the inexhaustible
incorporate (Spirit) in the body. The quality (or attribute) of goodness binds the soul with pleasure and knowledge;
that of passion (activity), with desire and action; that of dark
ness (dulnsss), with ignorance. One that has the attribute of goodness chiefly goes after death to the highest heaven; -one that has chiefly passion is born again among men of action;
one that has chiefly darkness is born among the ignorant.
One that sees that these attributes are the only agents, one
that knows what is higher than the attributes, enters into- my
being. The incorporate spirit that has passed above the three
attributes (the origin of bodies), being released from birth,
death, age, and pain, obtains immortality. To pass above these attributes one must become indifferent to all change, be undisturbed by anything, and worship Me with devotion. . . . I am to be learned from all the Vedas; I made the Vedanta; I alone know the Vedas. There are two persons in the world,
one destructible and one indestructible; the destructible one is
all created things; the indestructible one is called the Un
changing one. But there is still a third highest person, called the Supreme Spirit, who, pervading the three worlds, supports them, the inexhaustible Lord. Inasmuch as I surpass the destruc
tible and am higher than the indestructible, therefore am I known in the world and in the Veda as the Highest Person."



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 399
The references to the Sankhyas, or Sankhya-Yogas, are not yet exhausted. There is another in a following chapter (vi.
i8. 13) which some scholiasts say refers to the Vedanta-system,
though this is in direct contradiction to the text. But the extracts already given suffice to show how vague and uncertain are, on the whole, the philosophical views on which depends the Divine Song. Until the end of these citations one hears only of nature and spirit, the two that have no beginning, but here one finds the Supreme Spirit, which is as distinct from
the indestructible one as from the destructible. Moreover, ' nature ' is in one place represented as from the beginning distinct
from spirit and entirely apart from it, and in another it is only
a transient phase. The delusion (illusion) which in one pas
sage is all that exists apart from the Supreme Spirit is itself given up in favor of the Sankhya Prakriti, with which one must imagine it to be identified, although from the text itself it cannot be identical. In a word, exactly as in Manu, there are different philosophical conceptions, united without any
logical basis for their union. The ' system ' is in general that of the Sankhya-Yogas, but there is much which is purely Vedanta. The Sankhya system is taught elsewhere as a means
of salvation, perhaps always as the deistic Yoga (i. 75. 7 : " He taught them the Sankhya-knowledge as salvation "). It is further noticeable that although Krishna (Vishnu) is the ostensible speaker, there is scarcely anything to indicate that the poem was- originally composed even for Vishnu. The Divine Song was
probably, as we have said, a late Upanishad, which afterwards was expanded and put into Vishnu's mouth. The Sankhya portions have been redressed as far as possible and to the illusion
doctrine is given the chief place. But the Song remains, like the Upanishads themselves, and like Manu, an ill-assorted cabinet
of primitive philosophical opinions. On the religious side it is a matter of comparative indifference whether that which is not
the spirit is a delusive output of the spirit or indestructible

matter. In either case the Spirit is the goal of the spirit. In this personal pantheism absorption is taught but not death.
Immortality is still the reward that is offered to. the believer
that is wise, to the wise that believes. Knowledge and faith
are the means of obtaining this immortality; but, whereas in the older Upanishads only wisdom is necessary (wisdom that
implies morality), here as much stress, if not more, is laid upon
faith, the natural mark of all sectarian pantheism. Despite its occasional power and mystic exaltation, the Divine Song in its present state as a poetical production is
unsatisfactory. The same thing is said over and over again, and the contradictions in phraseology and in meaning are as
numerous as the repetitions, so that one is not surprised to find it described as " the wonderful song, which causes the hair to stand on end." The different meanings given tothe same words are indicative of its patchwork origin, which again would help to explain its philosophical inconsistencies. It was probably composed, as it stands, before there was any formal Vedanta system; and in its original shape without doubt it precedes the formal Sankhya; though both philosophies existed long before they were systematized or reduced to Sutra form. One has not to imagine them as systems originally distinct and opposed.
They rather grew out of a gradual intensification of the opposition involved in the conception of Prakriti (nature) and Maya
(illusion), some regarding these as identical, others insisting
that the latter was not sufficient to explain nature. The first philosophy (and philosophical religion) concerned itself less with the relation of matter to mind (in modern psylance) than with the relation of the individual self (spirit) to the Supreme
Spirit. Different explanations of the relation of matter to this
Supreme Spirit were long held tentatively by philosophers, who would probably have said that either the Sankhya or Vedanta
might be true, but that this was not the chief question. Later came the differentiation of the schools, based mainly on a



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 401
question that was at first one of secondary importance. In another part of the epic Krishna liimself is represented as the
victim of 'illusion ' (iii. "21. 30) on the field of battle.
The doctrine of the Bhagavad Gita, the Divine Song, is by
no means isolated. It is found in many other passages of the epic, besides being imitated in the Anugita of the pseudo-epic. To one of these passages it is worth while to turn, because of the form in which this wisdom is enunciated. The passage immediately following this teaching is also of great interest. Of
the few Vedic deities that receive hymnal homage chief is the sun, or, in his other form, Agni. The special form of Agni has been spoken of above. He is identified with the All in some
late passages, and gives aid to his followers, although not in battle. It will have been noticed in the Divine Song that Vishnu asserts that the Song was proclaimed to the sun, who in turn
delivers it through Manu to the king-seers, the sun being
especially the kingly god.^ In the third book there is an hymn to the sun, in which this god is addressed almost in the terms of the Divine Song, and immediately preceding is the doctrine
just alluded to. After the explanation is given that re-birth
affects creatures and causes them to be born in earth, air, or water, the changes of metempsychosis here including the vegetable world as well as the animal and divine worlds,^ the very essence of the Divine Song is given as "Vedic word," viz.,
kuric karma tyajeti ca, " Perform and quit acts,'' i.e., do what you ought to do, but without regard to the reward of action
(iii. 2. 72, 74). There is an eightfold path of duty, as in Bud
dhism, but here it consists in sacrifice, study, liberality, and
penance ; truth, mercy, self-control, and lack of greed. As the
1 Compare a parallel list of diadochoi in xii. 349. 51. 2 One of tile Jaina traits of the epic, brahmddisit irnduicpt bhiitcsu parivartate^ in distinction from the Buddhistic metempsychosis, which stops short of plants. But perhaps it is rather borrowed from the Brahman by the Jain, for there is a formal acknowledgment that sihdvards, ' stationary things,' have part in metempsychosis, Manu, xii. 42, although in the distribution that follows this is almost ignored (vs. 58).



402 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
result of practicing the first four, one goes on the course that leads to the Manes ; as the result of practicing the last four,
one goes on the course that leads to the gods. But in practicing any virtues one should practice them without expectation of reward {abhimana, arriere pensde). The .Yogi, the devotee, who renounces the fruit of everything, is the greatest man ; his
powers are miraculous. There follows (with the same light inconsistency to be found in the Divine Song) the appeal fqr action and the exhortation
to pray to the sun for success in what is desired. For it is
explained that the sun is the father of all creation. The sun draws up clouds with his heat, and his energy, being trans
muted into water, with the help of the moon, is distilled into
plants as rain, and in this way the food that man eats is full
of solar energy, and man and all that live by food must regard the sun as their father. Preliminary to the hymn to the sun is given a list of his hundred and eight names,^ among which are to be noticed : Aryaman, Soma, Indra, Yama, Brahma, Vishnu, ^iva. Death, Time, Creator, the Endless One, Kapila, the Unborn One, the Person (Purusha ; with which are to be compared the names of Vishnu in the Divine Song), the Allmaker, Varuna, the Grandfather, the Door of Heaven, etc. And then the Hymn to the Sun (iii. 3. 36ff.)r "Thou, O Sun, of creatures art the eye ; the spirit of all that have embodied form ; thou art the source of all created things ; thou art the
custom of them that make sacrifice ; thou art the goal of the Sankhyas and the hope of the Yogis ; the course of all that seek deliverance . . . Thou art worshipped by all ; the three
and thirty gods (!) worship thee, etc. ... I think that in all the seven worlds" and all the braAma-worlds there is nothing
1 It is rather difficult to compress the list into this number. Some of the names are perhaps later additions. 2 In contrast one niay note the frequent boast that a king 'fears not even the gods,' e.^., i. 199. I. 3 Later there are twenty-one worlds analogous to the twenty-one hells.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 403
which is superior to the sun. Other beings there are, both powerful and great, but they have no such glory as the sun's.
Father of light, all beings rest in thee ; O Lord of light, all
things, all elements are in thee. The disc- of Vishnu was fashioned by the All-maker (one of the sun's names !) with thy
glory. Over all the earth, with its thirteen islands, thou shinest with thy kine (rays). . . } Thou art the beginning and the end of a day of Brahma. . . . They call thee Indra ; thou art Rudra, Vishnu, the Father-god, Fire, the subtile mind ; thou art the Lord, and thou, eternal brahma." There is here also a very significant admixture of Vedic and Upanishadic religion. In Krishna, who in the Upanishads is known already by his own and his mother's name, pantheism is made personal according to the teaching of one sect. But while the whole epic is in evidence for the spuriousness of the claim of Krishna to be regarded as incarnate Vishnu (God), there is scarcely a trace in the original epic of the older view in regard to Vishnu himself. Thus in one passage he is called " the younger brother
of Indra" (iii. 12. 25). But, since Indra is at no time the chief god of the epic, and the chapter in which occurs this
expression is devoted to extolling Krishna -Vishnu as the Allgod, the words appear to be intended rather to identify Krishna with Vishnu, who in the Rig Veda is inferior to Indra, than to detract from Vishnu's glory. The passage is cited below.
What now is the relation of Vishnu-Krishna to the other divinities ? Vishnuite and Qivaite, each cries out that his god
includes the other, but there is no current identity of Brahma, Vishnu, Qiva as three co-equal representations of one God. For example, in iii. 189. 5, one reads: "I am Vishnu, I am Brahma, and I am Qiva," but one cannot read into this any trinitarian doctrine whatever, for in context the passage reads as a whole : " I am Narayana, I am Creator and Destro)'er,
1 Elsewhere, on the other hand, the islands are four or seven, the earlier view.



404 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
I am Vishnu, I am Brahma, I am Indra, the master-god, ,I am king Kubera, Yama, Qiva, Soma, Kagyapa, and also the Fathergod." Again, Vishnu says that the Father-god, or grandparent of the gods, is " one-half of my body," and does not mention
Qiva (iii. 189. 39). Thus, also, the hymn to Qiva in iii. 39. 76 £f. is addressed " to Qiva having the form of Vishnu, to Vishnu having the form of Qiva, to the three-eyed god, to Qarva, the trident-holder, the sun, Ganega," but with no mention of Brahma. The three gods, Brahma, Vishnu, Qiva, however, are sometimes
grouped together (but not as a trinity) in late passages, in
contrast t-o Indra, e.g., ix. 53. 26. There are many hymns to Vishnu and ^iva, where each is without beginning, the God,
the uncreated Creator. It is only when the later period, look
ing back on the respective claims of the sects, identifies each god with the other, and both with their predecessor, that one
gets even the notion of a trinity. Even for this later view of
the pseudo-epic only one passage will be found (cited below). The part of Brahma in the epic is most distinctly in process
of subordination to the sectarian gods. He is holy and eternal, but not omniscient, though wise. As was shown above, he works at the will of Vishnu. He is one with Vishnu only in the sense that all is one with the All-god. When Vishnu
' raises the earth ' as a boar, Brahma tells the gods to go to
him.' He councils the gods. His heaven is above Indra's, but he is really only an intermediary divinity, a passive activity, if the paradox may be allowed. Not like Indra (to whom he is superior) does he fight with All-gods, or do any great act of
his own will. He is a shadowy, fatherly, beneficent advisor
to the gods, his children ; but all his activity is due to Vishnu.
This, of course, is from the point of view of the Vishnuite.
1 iii. 142. The boar-sliape of Visiinu is a favorite one, as is the dwarf-incarnation. Compare Vamana, Vamanaka, Vishnupada, in the list of holy watering-places (iii. S3). ' Many of Vishnu's acts are simply transferred from Brahma, to whom they belonged in older tales. Compare above, p. 215.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 405
But there is no Brahmaite to modify the imp'ression. There existed no strong Brahma sect as there were Vishnu and Qiva sects. Brahma is jn his place merely because to the preceding age he was the highest god ; for the epic regards Creator, Prajapati, Pitamaha, Brahma as synonymous.-' The abstract (^rrt/^;«(7,' which in the Upanishads is the same with the Supreme Spirit, was called personally Brahma, and this Brahma is now the Brahmanic Father-god. The sects could never get rid of a god whose being was rooted alike in the preceding philosophy and in the popular conception of a Father-god. Each age of thought takes the most advanced views of the preceding age as its axioms. The Veda taught gods ; the Brahmanas taught a Father-god above the gods ; the Upanishads taught a Supreme Godhead of which this Father-god was the active manifestation. The sects taught that their heroes were incarnations of this Supreme, but they carried with them the older pantheon as well, and, with the pantheon, its earlier and later heads, Indra and Brahma. Consequently each sect admits that Brahma is greater than the older Vedic gods, but, while naturally it
identifies its special incarnation first with its most powerful
opponent, and thus, so to speak, absorbs its rival, it identifies this incarnation with Brahma only as being chief of lesser
divinities, not as being a rival. One may represent the attitude of a Krishna-worshipper in the epic somewhat in this way
:
" Krishna is a modern incarnation of Vishnu, the form which is taken in this age by the Supreme Lord. You who worship Qiva should know that your Qiva is really my Krishna, and
1 In i. 197, Prajapati. the Father-god, is the highest god, to whom Indra, as usual, runs for help. Qiva appears as a higher god, and drives "Indra into a hole, where he sees five former Indras ; and finally Vishnu comes on to the stage as the highest of all, " the infinite, inconceivable, eternal, the All in endless forms." Brahma is invoked now and then in a perfunctory way, but no one really expects him to do anything. He has done his work, made the castes, the sacrifice, and (occasionally) everything. And he will do this again when the new aeon begins. But for this aeon his work is accomplished.



406 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
the chief point is to recognize my Krishna as the Supreme Lord. The man Krishna is the Supreme Lord in human form. Of course, as such, being the One God in whom are all things and beings, he is also all the gods known by names which
designate his special functions. Thus he is the head of the
gods, the Father-god, as our ancestors called him, Brahma ; and he is all the gods known by still older names, who are the children of the secondary creator, Brahma, viz., Agni, Indra, Surya, etc. All gods are active manifestations of the Supreme God called Vishnu, who is born on earth to-day as Krishna." And the Qivaite says: " Qiva is the manifestation of the All
god,'' and repeats what the Vishnuite says, substituting Qiva for Vishnu,^ but with the difference already explained, namely, that the Qiva-sect has no incarnation to which to point, as has the Vishnuite. Qiva is modified Rudra, and both are old godnames. Later, however, the Qivaite has also his incarnate god. As an example of later Qiva-worship may be taken Vishnu's own hymn to this god in vii. 80. 54 ff.: "Reverence to Bhava,
Qarva, Rudra (Qiva), the bestower of gifts, the lord of cattle,
the terrible, great, fearful, god of three wives ;^ to him who is
peace, the Lord, the slayer of sacrifices {makhaghnd) ^ ... to the blue-necked god ; to the inventor (or author) ... to truth ;
to the red god, to the snake, to the unconquerable one, to the blue-haired one, to the trident-holder ; ... to the inconceivable one ... to him whose sign is the bull ; ... to the creator of all, who pervades all, who is worshipped by all. Lord of all, Qarva, Qankara, Qiva, . . . who has a thousand heads a
1 Thus in xii. ?85. 165 : " Neither Brahma nor Vishnu is capable of understanding the greatness of (^iva." 2 Or " three eyes." 3 Compare iii. 39. ']^ : " The destroyer of Dal^sha's sacrifice." Compare the same epithet in the hymn to C^iva, x. 7. 3. after which appear the devils who serve ^iva. Such devils, in the following, feast on the dead upon the field of battle, though, when left to themselves, ' midnight is the hour when the demons swarm,' iii. 1 1 . 4 and 33. In X. 18 and xiii. 161 (Jiva's act is described in full.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 407
thousand arms, and death, a thousand eyes and legs, whose acts are innumerable.'' In vii. 201. 71, Qiva is the unborn Lord, inconceivable, the soul of action, the unmoved one ; and
he that knows Qiva as the self of self, as the unknowable one, goes to brahma-hYisz. This also is late Qivaism in pantheistic form. In other words, everything said of Vishnu must be repeated for Qiva.^
As an example of the position of the lowest member of the
later trinity and his very subordinate placte, may be cited a passage from the preceding book of ih'e 'epic. According to the story in vi. 65. 42 ff., the seers were all engaged in worshipping Brahma, as the highest divinity they knew, when he suddenly began to worship "the Person (Spirit), the highest Lord"; and Brahma then lauds ¥ishnu as such : " Thou art the god of the universe, the All-god, Vasudeva (Krishna). 'Therefore I worship thee as the divinity;- thou, whose sotil is devotion. Victory
to thee, great god of all ; thou takest satisfaction in that which
benefits the world. . . . Lord of lords of all, thou out of whose navel springs the lotus, and whose eyes are large ; Lord of the
things that were, that are, that are to be ; O'dear one, self-born
of the self-born . . . O great snake, O boar,^ O thou the first
one, thou who dwellest in all, endless one, known as brahnia,
everlasting origin of all beings . . . destroyer of the worlds ! Thy feet are the earth . . . heaven is thy head ... I, Brahma, am thy form . . . Sun and moon are thy eyes . . . Gods and all beings were by me created on earth, but they owe their origin
to thy goodness." Then the creation of Vishnu through Pra
1 ^iva, called Bhava, (^arva, the trident-holder, the Lord O^ana), (^ankara, the Great God, etc., generally appears at his best where the epic is at its worst, the interpolations being more flagrant than in the case of Vishnuite eulogies. The most devout worshipper of Vishnu is represented as an adherent of (^iva, as invoking him for help after lighting with him. He is " invincible before the three worlds." He is the sun ; his blood is ashes. All the gods, with Brahma at their head, revere him. He has three heads, three faces, six arms (compare iii. 39. 74 fl. ; 83. 125) ; though other passages give him more. 2 giva has as sign the bull : Vishnu, the boar.



408 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
dyumna as a form of the deity is described, " and Vishnu (Aniruddha) created me, Brahma, the upholder of the worlds ; so am I made of Vishnu; I am caused only by thee." While Brahma is represented here as identical with Vishnu
he is at the same time a distinctly inferior personality, created
by Vishnu for the purpose of creating worlds, a factor of inferior
godliness to that of the World-Spirit, Krishna-Vishnu. It had been stated by Holtzmann ^ that Brahma sometimes appears in the epic as a god superior to Vishnu, and on the strength of this L. von Schroeder has put the date of the early epic between the seventh and fourth centuries B.C., because at that time Brahma was the chief god.^ von Schroeder rather
exaggerates Holtzmann's results, and asserts that " in the original form of the poem Brahma appears throughout as the highest and most revered.god, while the worship of Vishnu and Qiva as great gods is apparently a later intrusion " (lac. cii.').
This asseveration will have to be' taken cujn grano. Had von Schroeder said ' pantheistic gods ' he would have been correct in this regard, but we think that both Vishnu and Qiva were great gods, equal, if not superior to Brahma, when the epic proper began. And, moreover, when one speaks of the original form of the poem he cannot mean the pseudo-epic or the ancient legends which have been woven into the epic, themselves of earlier date. No one means by the 'early epic' the
tales of Agastya, of the creation of Death, of the making of ambrosia, but the story of the war in its earliest shape; for the epic poem must have begun with its own subject-matter. Now it is not true that Brahma is regarded ' throughout ' the early
poem as a chief god at all. If one investigate the cases where Vishnu or Qiva appears ' below ' Brahma he will see, in almost
every case that Holtzmann has registered, that this condition of affairs is recorded not in the epic proper but in the Brahmanic portions of the pseudo-epic, or in ancient legends alone. Thus
1 ZDMG. xxxviii. pp. 197, 200. 2 Lit. u, Ctiltur, p. 461.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 409
in the story of the winning of ambrosia, of Agastya drinking ocean, and of Rama, Brahma appears to be above Vishnu, and also in some extracts from the pseudo-epic. For the real epic
we know of but two cases that can be put into this category, and neither is sufficient to support the hypothesis built upon it. For Krishna, when he ingeniously plots to have Bhima slay Jarasindha, is said to have renounced killing Jarasandha himself, 'putting Brahma's injunction before him' (ii. 22. 36), i.e., recalling Brahma's admonition that only Bhima was fated to slay the foe. And when Krishna and Satyaki salute Krishna's elder brother they do so (for being an elder brother Baladeva is Krishna's Gum) respectfully, ' just as Indra and Upendra
salute Brahma the lord of devas' (ix. 34. 18). Upendra is
Indra's younger brother, i.e., Vishnu (above). But these passages are scanty proof for the statement that Brahma appears throughout the early epic as the highest god ; -^ nor is there even so much evidence as this in the case of Qiva. Here, too,
it is in the tale of the churning of ocean, of Sunda and Upasunda, of the creation of the death-power, and in late didactic (Brahmanic) passages, where Brahma makes Qiva to destroy earth and Qiva is born of Brahma, and only in such tales,
or extracts from the Book of Peace, etc., that Brahma appears
as superior. In all other cases, in the real action of the epic, he is subordinate to Vishnu and Qiva whenever he is compared with them. When he is not compared he appears, of course, as the great old Father-god who creates and foresees, but even
here he is not untouched by passion, he is not all-knowing, and
his role as Creator is one that, with the allotment of duties among the gods, does not make him the highest god. All the old gods are great till greater appear on the scene. There is
scarcely a supreme Brahma in the epic itself, but there is a
1 Holtzmann now says (in Neitnz:hn BUcher,^. 198) that the whole episode which terminates with Baladeva's visit is an addition to the original. Holtzmann's monograph on Brahma is in ZDMG. xxxviii. 167.



410 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
great Brahma, and a greater (older) than the sectarian gods in the old Brahmanic legends, while the old Brahmanhood reasserts
itself sporadically in the Qanti, etc., and tells how the sectarian gods became supreme, how they quarrelled and laid the strife. Since the adjustment of the relations between the persons of the later trinity is one of the most important questions in the
theology of the completed epic, it will be necessary to go a lit
tle further afield and see what the latest books, which hitherto
we have refrained as much as possible from citing, have to say
on the subject. As it seems to be true that it was felt neces
sary by the ^ivaite to offset the laud of Vishnu by antithetic laud of Qiva,^ so after the completion of the Book of Peace,
itself a late addition to the epic, and one that is markedly Vish
nuitic, there was, before the Genealogy of Vishnu, an antithetic Book of Law, which is as markedly Qivaitic. In these books
one finds the climax of sectarianism, in so far as it is represented by the epic ; although in earlier books isolated passages of late addition are sporadically to be found which have much the same nature. Everywhere in these last additions Brahma is on a plane which is as much lower than that of the Supreme
God as it is higher than that of Indra. Thus in viii. 33. 45, Indra takes refuge with Brahma, but Brahma turns for help to Qiva (Bhava, Sthanu, Jishnu, etc.) with a hymn sung by the gods and seers. Then comes a description of Qankara's ^ (Qiva's) war-car, with its metaphorical arms, where Vishnu is the point of Civa's arrow (which consists of Vishnu, Soma, Agni), and of this war-car Brahma himself is the charioteer {ib. 34. 76). With customary inconsistency, however, when Qiva wishes his son to be exalted he prostrates himself before Brahma, who then gives this youth {kiimdrd), called Kartikeya,
1 A good example is that of the two visions of Arjuna, first tlie vision of Vishnu,' then anotlier vision of C^iva, wliom Arjuna and Vishnu visit (vii. So). 2 (^anlcara and (^iva mean almost the same; 'giver of blessings ' and 'prospering' (or ' kindly '), respectively.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 411
the ' generalship ' over all beings {sainapatyam, ix. 44. 43-49).
There is even a ' celebration of Brahma,' a sort of harvest festi
val, shared, as the text tells, by all the castes ; and it must have been something like the religious game?' of the Greeks, for it was celebrated by athletic contests.' Brahma, as the old independent creator, sometimes keeps his place, transmitting posterity through his ' seven mind-born sons,' the great seers
(iii. 133; xii^ 166. I iff.). But Brahma himself is born either
in the golden egg, as a secondary growth (as in xii. 312. 1-7), or, as is usually the case, he is born in the lotus which springs from the navel of musing^ Vishnu (iii. 203. 14). In this passage Brahma has four faces (Vedas) and four forms, caturmiirtis
(15), and this epithet in other sections is transferred to Vishnu. Thus in vii. 29. 26, Vishu says caturmurtir akam, " I have four forms," but he never says trimurtir aham (' I have three forms'). There is one passage, however, that makes for a belief in a trinity. It stands in contrast to the various Vishnulte hymns, one of which may well be reviewed as an example of the regular Vishnuite laudation affected by the Krishna sect (iii. 12. 2 1 £f.) : " Krishna is Vishnu, Brahma, Soma, the Sun, Right, the Creator ('founder'), Yama, Fire, Wind, Qiva, Time, Space,
Earth, and the cardinal points. Thou, Krishna, art the Crea
tor (' emitter ') ; thou, chief of gods, didst worship the highest
;
thou, Vishnu called, becamest Indra's younger brother, entering into sonship with Aditi ; as a child with three steps thou didst
fill the sky, space, and earth, and pass in glory. ... At the end
of the age thou returnest all things into thyself. At the begin
ning of the age Brahma was born from thy lotus-navel as the venerable preceptor of all things (the same epithet is in vs. 22 applied to Vishnu himself) ; and Qiva sprang from thy angry

412 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
forehead when the demons would kill him (Brahma) ; both are born of thee, in whom is the universe." The following verses (45 ff.) are like those of the Divine Song : " Thou, Knight
Arjuna, art the soul of Krishna; thou art mine alone and thine
alone am I ; they that are mine are thine ; he that hates thee
hates Me, and he that is for thee is for Me ; thou art Nara ('man') and I am Narayana ('whose home is on the waters,' god);' we are the same, there is no difference between us."
Again, like the Divine Song in the following verses (51-54) is
the expression ' the sacrifice and he that sacrifices,' etc., together
with the statement that Vishnu plays ' like a boy with playthings,'
with the crowds of gods, Brahma, Qiva, Indra, etc. The pas
sage opposed to this, and to other identifications of Vishnu
with many gods, is one of the most flagrant interpolations in
the epic. If there be anything that the Supreme God in ^iva
ite or Vishnuite form does not do it is to extol at length, with
out obvious reason, his rivals' acts and incarnations. Yet in this clumsy passage just such an extended laudation of Vishnu is put
into the mouth of Qiva. In fact, iii. 272, from 30 to 76, is an
interpretation of the most naive sort, and it is here that we iind the approach to the later trimUrti (trinity): "Having the form of Brahma he creates ; having a human body (as Krishna) he
protects, in the nature of Qiva he would destroy — these are the three appearances or conditions (avasthds) of the Father
god" (Prajapati).^ This comes after an account of the fourfaced lotus-born Brahma, who, seeing the world a void, emitted his sons, the seers, mind-born, like to himself (now nine in number), who in turn begot all beings, including men (vss. 44-47). If, on the other hand, one take the later sectarian account of
1 Man (divine) and god human, but Narayana is a new name of Vislinu, and the two are reckoned as two inseparable seers (divinities). 2 This is the only really trinitarian passage in the epic. In i. j. 32 ; xiii. 16. 15, the belief may be indicated, but not certainly, as it is in Hariv. 10,662. See on this point Holtzmann, ZDMG. xxxviii. p. 204. In xiv. 54. 14 the form is Vishnu, Brahma, Indra.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 413
Vishnu (for the above is more in honor of Krishna the man-god than.of Vishnu, the form of the Supreme God), he will see that even in the pseudo-epic the summit of the theological concep
tions is the emphasis not of trinity or of multifariousness but of unity. According to the text the Pancakalajnas are the same with the Vishnuite sect called Pancaratras, and these are most
emphatically ekantinas, i.e., Unitarians (xii. 336 ; 337. 46 ; 339. 66-67).^ In this same passage 341. 106, Vishnu is again catur
miertidhi't, ' the bearer of four forms,' an entirely different conception of him (below). So that even in this most advanced
sectarian literature there is no real threefoldness of the Su
preme as one in three. In the following chapter (xii. 335. i ff.) there is a passage like the great Ka hymn of the Rig Veda, ' whom as god shall one worship ? ' The sages say to Vishnu : "All men worship thee; to whom dost thou offer worship?" and he says, 'to the Eternal Spirit.' The conception of the functions of Brahma and Qiva in relation to Vishnu is plainly
shown in xii. 342. ig : " Brahma and Qiva create and destroy at the will of Vishnu ; they are born of his grace and his anger." In regard to Civa himself, his nature and place in Vishnuism have been sufficiently explained. The worship of this god is
referred to ' Vedic texts' (the (ata-rudriyam, vii. 202. 120);^ Vishnu is made to adore the terrible god {ib. 201. 69) who
appears as a mad ascetic, a wild irover, a monster, a satire on man and gods, though he piously carries a rosary, and has other late traits in his personal appearance.' The strength of Qiva
ism lay in the eumenidean (Qiva is 'prospering,' 'kindly')
1 Compare 339. 1 14, " thou art fancamahakalpa." The commentator gives the names of five sects, Saura, (^akta, Ganega, Qaiva, Vaishnava. The ' five times,' implied in Paiicakala, he says are day, night, month, seasons, and year {ib. 66). In 340. 117 (which chapter is Pancaratric), Brahma "knows that Vishnu is superior." 2 Vaj. S. xvi. 1-66 ; Taitt. S. iv. 5. i-ii. 3 ^iva has no ordinary sacrifice : he is (as above) in general a destroyer of sacrifice, i.e., of Vedic sacrifice ; but as Pajupati, " Lord of lieasts," he claims the bloody sacrifice of the first beast, man.



414 THE RELIGION'S OF INDIA.
euphemism and fear alike, which shrank in speech and mind from the object of fear. But this religion in the epic had a
firmer hold than that of fear. It was essentially phallic in its outward form (vii. 201. 93-96), and as such was deeply rooted in the religious conscience of a people to whom one may venture perhaps to ascribe such a form of worship even in the time of the Rig Veda, although the signs thereof in great part have been suppressed. This may be doubted/ indeed, for the earlier age ; but there is no question that epic Qivaism, like Qivaism to-day, is dependent wholly on phallic worship (xiii.
14. 230 ff;). It is the par.allel of Bacchic rites and orgies, as
well as of the worship of the demons in distinction from that of good powers. Qiva represents the ascetic, dark, awful, bloody
side of religion : Vishnu, the gracious, calm, hopeful, loving
side ; the former is fearful, mysterious, demoniac ; the latter is
joyful, erotic, divine. In their later developments it is not surprising to see that Vishnuism, in the form of Krishnaism, becomes more and more erotic, while Qivaism becomes more and more ghastly and ghoulish.
Wild and varied as are the beliefs of the epic, there is space
but to show a few more .characteristic sides of its theology a phase that may seem questionable, yet, since the devout Hindu believes the teachings of the epic, they must all to him constitute one theology, although it was gradually amalgamated
out of different creeds.
In connection with Qiva stands, closely united, his. son,
Ganega, "leader of troops," still worshipped as one of the popular gods, and the battle-god, Skanda, the son first of Agni then of Qiva, the conqueror of the demons, ddnavas, and later representative of Indra, with whom the epic identifies him.
For it is Skanda that is the real battle-god of the later epic
;
1 The usual opinion is that phallic worship was a trait of southern tribes foisted upon northern (Jivaism. Philosophically (Jivaism is first monotheistic and then pantheistic. To-day it is nominally pantheistic but really it is dualistic.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 415
though in its original form Indra was still the warrior's refuge,
as attests the stereotyped phraseology. In iii. 225-232 honor and praise are ascribed to Skanda in much the same language
with that used to portray his father, Qiva. " The god of a
thousand arms, the Lord of all, the creator of gods and demons " are phrases used in his eulogy. - He too has a list of names ; his nurse is the " maiden of the red (bloody) sea,"
called Lohitayani. His terrible_,appearance and fearful acts make him the equal of Qiva.'" His sign is a kukkuta, cock ;
ib. 229. 33. Associated, again, with Skanda are the spirits or 'mothers,'
which afflict, people. The belief in mother-gods is old, but its epic form is new. The exactness and detail in regard to these beautiful monsters show at least a real belief, which, as one on a lower plane besides the higher religion, cannot be passed over without notice. As in other lands, people are ' possessed
'
by evil spirits, called possessors or seizers {grahas). These are Skanda's demons,^ and are both male and female. Until one reaches the age of sixteen he is liable to be possessed by one group of ' seizers,' who must be worshipped in proper form that their wrath may be averted. Others menace mortals from the age of sixteen to severity. After that only the fever-demon
is to be feared. Imps of this sort are of three kinds. One kind indulge only in mischievous sport : another kind lead one to gluttony ; the third kind are devoted to lust. They are known as Pigacas, Yakshas, etc., and when they seize a person he goes mad. They are to be kept at bay by self-restraint
and moderation (iii. 230. 43-56). In ix. 46 and iii. 226 the ' mothers ' are described. They are witches, and live in cross
1 There are indications in this passage of some sectarian feeling, and the fear of partisan warfare (229) ; in regard to which we add from Muir and Holtzmann tlie passage xii. 343. I2r, where is symbolized a peaceful issue of war tietween Vishnuism and Qivaism. 2 Grahas are also planets, but in this cult they are not astrological, as show their names.

roads, cemeteries, and mountains. They may be of Dravidian origin, and in tlieir epic form, at any rate, are a late intrusion.''
Just before tlie Divine Song begins, the knight who is about
to become illuminated or ' disillusioned ' offers a prayer to the terrible goddess Durga, also one of the new, popular, and horrible forms of divine manifestation. In this hymn, vi. 23, Durga (Uma, Parvati, Kali, etc.) is addressed as " leader of the
armies of the blessed, the dweller in Mandara, the youthful woman. Kali, wife of Qiva, she who is red, black, variegated
;
the savior, the giver of gifts, Katyayani, the great benefactress,
the terrible one, the victorious one, victory itself . . . Uma, the slayer of demons,"^ and the usual identification and theft of epithets then follows : " O thou who art the Vedas, who art
Revelation, who art virtue, Jatavedasi, . . . thou art brahma among the sciences, thou art the sleep of incorporate beings, the mother of Skanda, the blessed one, Durga . . . thou art the mother of the Vedas and Vedanta . . . thou art sleep, illusion, modesty, happiness . . . thou art satisfaction, growth,
contentment, light, the increaser of moon and sun."
Turning from these later parasites,^ which live on their parent gods and yet tend to reduce them, we now revert to that happiness hereafter to which looks forward the epic knight that has not been tempted to ' renounce ' desire. In pantheistic passages he is what the later remodeller makes him. But enough of old belief remains to show that the warrior really cared a great
1 They are possibly old, as Weber thinks, but they seem to have nothing in common with the ancient female divinities. 2 Compare another hymn to Durga in iv. 6. 5 ff. (late). Durga was probably an independent local deity, subsequently regarded as Qiva's female side. She plays a great r61e, under various names, in the * revived ' literature, as do the love-god and Ganega. In both hymns she is 'Vishnu's sister,' and in iv. 6 a 'pure virgin.' 3 One- comparatively new god deserves a passing mention, Dharma's son, Kama, the (Grecian ?) love-god, ' the, mind-shaker,' ' the limbless one,' whose arrows are like those of Cupid (i. 66. 32 ; 171. 34 ; iii. 46. 2). He is an adventitious addition to the epic. His later name of Ananga occurs in xii. 59. 91. In i. 71. 41 and 171. 40 he is Manmatha. The Atharvan god also has darts, iii. 25, a mark of this latest Veda.



HINDUISM. — VISHXU AA'D QIVA. 417
deal more for heaven than he did for absorption. As to the
cause of events, as was said above, it is Fate. Repeatedly is heard the lament, " Fate (impersonal) is the highest thing, fie on vain human effort." The knight confesses with his lips to
a belief in the new doctrine of absorption, but at heart he is
a fatalist. And his aim is to die on the field of battle, that he may go thence directly to the heaven that awaits the good and the brave. "^ Out of a long description of this heaven a
few extracts "here selected will show what the good knight
anticipates :
" Upward goes the path that leads to gods; it is inhabited by them that have sacrificed and have done penance. Unbelieving persons and untruthful persons do not enter there; only they that have duteous souls, that have conquered self, and heroes that bear the marks of battle. There sit the seers and gods, there are shining, self-illumined worlds, made of light, resplendent. And in this heaven there is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor weariness, nor cold, nor heat, nor fear ; nothing that is terrible is there, nothing unclean ; but pleasing sights, and sounds, and smells. There is no care there, nor age, nor work, nor sorrow. Such is the heaven that is the reward of good acts. Above this is Brahma's world, where sit the seers and the three and thirty gods," etc.
Over against this array of advantages stands the one great "fault of heaven," which is stated almost in the words of " nessun maggior dolore," " the thought (when one lives again on the lower plane) of former happiness in the higher life is
terrible grief" (vs. 30), i.e., this heaven will pass away at the
end of the world-period, when the Eternal draws all in to him
self again (iii. 261); and the thought that one has been in
heaven, while now he is (re-born) on earth, is a sorrow greater than the joy given by heaven.^
1 Compare ii. 22. iS : " Great holiness, great glory, penance, death in battle, these are each respectively productive of heaven ; the last alone is a sure cause." 2 This description and the sentiments are quite late. The same sort of heaven (without the philosophical bitterness, with which compare above, p. 229) is, however, found in other passages, somewhat augmented with nymphs and facile goddesses.



418 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
One is reminded by the epic description of heaven of that poet of the Upanishads who describes his heavenly bliss as consisting in the fact that in that world " there is neither
snow nor sorrow." The later version is only an amplification.
Even with the assurance that the "fault of heaven " is the disappointment of being dropped to earth again in 3, new birth,
the ordinary mortal is more averse from the bliss of absorption than from the pleasure of heaven. And in truth, except to one very weary of his lot in life, it must be confessed that the religion here shown in all its bearings is one eminently pleasant
to believe. Its gist, in a word, is this : " If you feel able to
endure it, the best thing to do is to study the plan of the universe, and then conform to it. By severe mental discipline you can attain to this knowledge, and for reward you will be immortally united with God." To this the sectarian adds: " Or believe in my god and the result will be the same." But both philosopher and sectarian continue : " If, however, you do not want to be united with the Supreme Spirit so soon as this, then be virtuous and devout, or simply be brave if you are a warrior ; do whatever the rules of morality and caste-custom bid you do, and you will go to heaven for thousands of ages
;
at the end of which time you will be re-born in a fine family on earth, and may again decide whether to repeat the process of gaining heaven or to join God and become absorbed into the World-Spirit at once." There were probably many that chose rather to repeat their agreeable earthly experience, with an interlude of heaven after each death, than to make the renunciation of earth and heaven, and be absorbed once for all into the All-god.
The doctrine of the ages' is so necessary ta a true understanding of the relative immortality offered as a substitute for
1 This doctrine is supposed by some scholars to be due to outside influence, but the doubt is not substantiated, and even in the Rig Veda one passage appears to refer to it. Doubtless, however, the later expanded view, with its complicated reckonings, may have been touched by foreign influence.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 419
the higher bliss of absorption (that is, genuine immortality), that an account of the teaching in this regard will not be out of place. The somewhat puzzling distinction between the
happy life of them that fail to desire absorption, and yet are
religious men, and the blissful life of those people that do
attain absorption, is at once explained by a clear understand
ing of the duration of the time of the gods' own life and of the divine heaven. Whereas the Greek notion of four ages includes within the four all time, all the four ages of the Hindu
are only a fraction of time. Starting at any one point of eter
nity, there is, according to the Hindu belief, a preliminary
' dawn ' of a new cycle of ages. This dawn lasts four hundred
years, and is then followed by the real age (the first of four), which lasts four thousand years, and has again a twilight end
ing of four hundred years in addition. This first is the Krita age, corresponding to the classical Golden Age. Its charac
teristics are, that in it everything is perfect ; right eternal now
exists in full power. In this age there are neither gods nor demons (Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshas, Serpents), neither buying nor selling, By a lucus a non the derivation of the name Krita is krtam eva na kartavyam, i.e., with a pun, it
is called the ' sacred age ' because there are no sacrifices in that age. No Sama Veda, Rig Veda, or Yajur Veda exist as distinct Vedas.^ There is no mortal work. Fruit comes by meditation ; the only duty is renunciation. Disease, lack of mental power,
moral defects (such as pride and hate) do not exist ; the high
est course of the ascetic Yogis is universally brahma {paramakani). In this age come into existence the Brahman, Ksha
triya, Vaigya, Qtidra, i.e., the distinct castes of priest, warrior, husbandman, and slave ; all with their special marks, and all
1 Na asan sdma-rg-yajur-varnds. In xii. 342. 8 the order is Rik-Yajus-AtharvanSaman. The habit of putting Saman instead of Rik at the head of the Vedas is still kept in the late litany to ^iva, who is " the Saman among the Vedas," meaning, of course, the first and best. In the same place, "(Jiva is the Itihasa" epic (xiii. 14. 323; and ib. 17. 78, 91), for the epic outweighs all the Vedas in its own estimation.



420 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
delighted with their proper occupations. Yet have all the
castes like occupations, like refuge, practice, and knowledge.
They are joined to the one god {eka deva), and have but one
mantra in their religious rites. Their duties are distinct, but
they follow only one "Veda and one rule. The four orders (of the time of life) are duly observed ; men do not desire the fruit of their action, and so they obtain the highest course, i.e.,
salvation by absorption into hrahma. In this age the 'three attributes ' (or qualities) are unknown. After this age follows the dawn of the second age, called Treta, lasting three hundred
years, then the real age of Treta, three thousand years, followed
by the twilight of three hundred years. The characteristics of
this age are, that men are devout; that great sacrifices begin {sattram pravartate); that Virtue decreases by one quarter; that all the various rites are produced, together with the attainment of salvation through working for that end, by means of sacrifice and generosity ; that every one does his duty and performs asceticism. The next age, Dvapara, is introduced by a dawn of two hundred years, being itself two thousand
years in duration, and it closes with a twilight of two hundred
years. Half of Virtue fails to appear in this age, that is, the
general virtue of the world is diminished by a half (' the Bull of Justice stands on two legs '). The Veda is now subdivided into four. Instead of every one having one Veda, four Vedas exist, but some people know only three, or two, or one, or are even Veda-less (anrcas). Ceremonies become manifold, because the treatises on duty are subdivided (!). The attribute
of passion influences people, and it is with this that they per
form asceticism and are generous (not with disinterestedness). Few (kafcif) are settled in truth ; ignorance of the one Veda
causes a multiplication of Vedas {i.e., as Veda means 'knowl
edge,' the Vedas result from ignorance of the essential knowledge). Disease and sin make penance necessary. People sacrifice only to gain heaven. After this age and its twilight



HINDUISM. — VISBNU AND QIVA. 421
are past begins the Kali, last of the four ages, with a dawn of one hundred, a course of one thousand, and a subsequent twilight of one hundred years. This is the present sinful age,
when there is no real religion, when the Vedas are ignored,
and the castes are confused, when itis (distresses of every form) are rife ; when Virtue has only one leg left to stand upon. The believer in Krishna as Vishnu, besides this uni
versal description, says that the Supreme Lord in the Krita
age is 'white' (pure); in the Treta age, 'red'; in the Dvapara
age, 'yellow'; in the Kali age, 'black,' i.e., Vishnu is Krishna, which means ' black.' ^ This cycle of ages always repeats itself anew. Now, since the twelve thousand years of these ages, with their dawns and twilights, are but one of countless
cycles, when the Kali age and its twilight have brought all
things into a miserable state, the universe is re-absorbed into
'
the Supreme Spirit. There is then a universal (apparent) destruction, pralaya, of everything, first by fire and then by a general flood. Seven suns appear in heaven, and what they fail to burn is consumed by the great fire called Samvartaka (really a manifestation of Vishnu), which sweeps the world and leaves only ashes ; then follows a flood which completes the annihilation. Thereafter follows a period equal to one thousand cycles (of twelve thousand years each), which is called ' Brahma's night,' for during these twelve million years Brahma sleeps; and the new Krita age begins again " when Brahma wakes up " (iii.
i88. 29, 69 ; 189. 42).^ All the gods are destroyed in the uni
versal destruction, that is, re-absorbed into the All-god, for
there is no such thing as annihilation, either of spirit or of matter (which is illusion). Consequently the gods' heaven and the
1 iii. 149. 14 ; 188. 2Z ; 189. 32 ; probably with a recollection of the colors of the four castes, white, red, yellow, black. According to xii. 233. 32, there 15 no sacrifice in the Krita age, but, beginning with the Treta age, there is a general diffusion of sacrifice in the Dvapara age. In another passage of the same book it is said that marriage laws arose in the Dvapara age (207. 38 ff.). 2 The teaching varies somewhat in the allotment of years. See Manu, I. 67.



422 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
spirits of good men in that heaven are also re-absorbed into that
Supreme, to be re-born in the new age. This is what is meant by the constant harping on quasi-immortality. Righteousness,
sacrifice, bravery, will bring man to heaven, but, though he joins the gods, with them he is destroyed. They and he, after
millions of years, will be re-born in the new heaven and the new earth. To escape this eventual re-birth one must desire
absorption into the Supreme, not annihilation, but unity with God, so that one remains untouched by the new order at the end of Brahma's 'day.' There are, of course, not lacking views of them that, taking the precept grossly, give a less dig
nified appearance to the teaching, and, in fact, upset its real intent. Thus, in the very same Puranic passage from which
is taken the description above (iii. i88), it is said that a seer,
who miraculously outlived the universal destruction of one cycle, was kindly swallowed by Vishnu, and that, on entering his stomach (the absorption idea in Puranic coarseness), he saw everything which had been destroyed, mountains, rivers, cities, the four castes engaged in their duties, etc. In other words, only transference of locality has taken place. But this account
reads almost like a satire.
One of the most striking features of the Hindu religions,
as they have been traced thus far, is the identification of right with light, and wrong with darkness. We have referred to it several times already. In the Vedic age the deities are luminous, while the demons and the abode of the wicked generally are of darkness. This view, usually considered Iranian and
Zoroastrian, is as radically, if not so emphatically. Indie. It might be said, indeed, that it is more deeply implanted in the worship of the Hindus than in that of the Iranians, inasmuch as the latter religion enunciates and promulgates the doctrine, while the former assumes it. All deeds of sin are deeds of darkness, tamas. The devils live underground in darkness
;
the hells are below earth and are gloom lighted only by torture



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 423
flames. The development of devil-worship (the side-scenes in the theatre of Qivaism) introduces devils of another sort, but the general effect remains. The fire-priest Bhrigu says : "Untruth is a form of darkness, and by darkness one is brought to hell (downwards) ; veiled in darkness one sees not the light. Light
is heaven, they say, and darkness is hell," xii. 190. 2-3. This
antithesis of evil as darkness, good as light, is too native to
India to admit of the suggestion that it might have been borrowed. But an isolated and curious Puranic chapter of the epic
appears to have direct reference to the Persian religion. All Hindu gods have sacrifices, even Qiva the ' destroyer of sacri
fice.' Now in iii. 220, after a preliminary account of the pan
cajanya fire (vs. 5 ff.) there is given a list of 'gods that destroy sacrifice,' de-vas yajnamusas, fifteen in number, who 'stand
here' on earth and 'steal' the sacrifice. They extend over the
five peoples in three divisions of five each. The first and third group contain names compounded with Bhima and Sura respectively ; while the third group is that of Sumitra, Mitravan, Mitrajna, Mitravardhana, Mitradharman. There are others without the mitra (vs. 10). The appellation devds seems to take them out of connection with Qiva's demoniac troops, and
the persistency of mitra would look as if these ' gods ' were of Iranian origin. There may have been (as are possibly the modern Sauras) believers in the Persian religion already long established among the Hindus. The question will naturally present itself whether in the
religious olla podrida known as the Mahabharata there are dis
tinct allusions to Buddhism, and, if so, in how far the doctrines of this sect may have influenced the orthodox religion. Buddhism does not appear to have attacked or to have attracted
the 'holy land,' whence, indeed, according to law, heretics are 'banished.' But its influence of course must have embraced
this country, and it is only a question of in how far epic Brahmanism has accepted it. At a later period Hinduism, as has



424 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
been observed, calmly accepts Buddha as an avatar of Vislinu. Holtzmann, who is inclined to attribute a good deal to Buddhism, sees signs of it even in the personal characteristics of the epic heroes, and believes the whole poem to have been
more or less affected by anti-Buddhistic feeling. If this were so one would have to give over to Buddhism much also of the humanitarianism to be found in the moral precepts that are so thickly strewn through the various books. In our opinion these signs-manual of Buddhism are not sufficiently evident to support Holtzmann's opinion for the whole poem, and it is to be noted that the most taking evidence is drawn from the
latest parts of the work. It is just here that we think it nec
essary to draw the line, for while much of late date has been
added in earlier books, yet in the books which one may call wholly late additions appear the strongest indications of Bud
dhistic influence.' A great deal of the Book of Peace is Puranic, the book as a whole is a Vishnuite addition further enlarged by Qivaite interpolation. The following book is,
again, an offset to the Book of Peace, and is as distinctly Qivaite in its conception as is the Book of Peace Vishnuite.^
It is here, in these latest additions, which scarcely deserve to be ranked with the real epic, that are found the most palpable touches of Buddhism. They stand to the epic proper as stands to them the Genealogy of Vishnu, a further addition which has
almost as much claim to be called 'part of the epic ' as have the books just mentioned, only that it is more evidently the product of a later age, and represents the Krishna- Vishnu sect in its glory after the epic was completed. Nevei'theless, even in these books much that is suspected of being Buddhistic may be Brahmanic ; and in any concrete case a decision, one way
1 Weber thinks, on the other hand, that the parties represent respectively, (^iva and Vishnu worship, Ind. St. i, 206. 2 This book also is closely in touch with the later Puranas. For instance, Citragupta, Yaina's secretary, is known only to the books of the pseudo-epic, the Vishnu Purana, the Padma Puiana, etc.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 425
or the other, is scarcely to be made on objective grounds. Still
more is this the case in earlier books. Thus, for instance, Holtzmann is sure that a conversation of a slave and a priest
in the third book is Buddhistic" because the man of low caste would not venture to instruct a Brahman.' But it is a command emphasized throughout the later Brahmanism that one must take refuge in the ship that saves ; and in passages not suspected of Buddhistic tendency Bhishma takes up this point, and lays down the rule that, no matter to which caste a man be
longs, his teaching if salutary is to be accepted. It is even said in one passage of the Book of Peace that one ought to learn of a slave, and in another that all the four castes ought to hear the Veda read:^ "Let him get instruction even from a Qudra if he can thereby attain to salvation " ; and again : " Put
ting the Brahman first, let the four castes hear (the Veda) ; for
'this (giving first place to the priest) is (the rule in) reading the Veda." '^ And in many places are found instructions given by low-caste men. It may be claimed that every case which resembles Buddhistic teaching is drawn from Buddhism, but this would be to claim mere than could be established. Moreover,
just as the non-injury doctrine is prior to Buddhism and yet is a mark of Buddhistic teaching, so between the two religions
there are many points of similarity which may be admitted without compromising the genuineness of the Brahmanic teaching. For Buddhism in its morality is anything but original*
1 Neunzehn Bilcher, p. 86. 2 The epic does not care much for castes in some passages. In one such it is said that members of all castes become priests when they go across the Gomal, iii. 84. 4S. 3 xii. 319. 87 ff, {prdpya Jndnam . . . ^zldrdd api) ; xii. 328. 49 {^rdvayec caiuro varndn). The epic regards itself as more than equivalent {adhikam) to the four Vedas, i. 1. 272.
4 Some ascribe the samsdra doctrine to Buddhistic influence — a thesis supported only by the fact that this occurs in late Brahmanic passages and Upanishads. But the assumption that Upanishads do not precede Buddha is scarcely tenable. The Katha, according to Weber {Sitz. Berl. Ak. 1890, p. 930), is late (Christian !) : according to Oldenberg and Whitney, early {Buddha, p. 56 ; Proc. AOS. May, 1886).



426 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Another bit of instruction from the Book of Peace illustrates
the attitude of the slave just referred to. In sharp contrast to what one would expect from a Buddhist, this slave, who is a
hunter, claims that he is justified in keeping on with his murderous occupation because it is his caste-occupation ; whereas, as a Buddhist he ought to have renounced it if he thought it sinful, without regard to the caste-rule. The Book of Peace lays it
down as a rule that the giving up of caste-occupation is meri
torious if the occupation in itself is iniquitous, but it hedges on the question to the extent of saying that, no matter whether the
occupation be sinful or not, if it is an inherited occupation a man does not do wrong to adhere to it. This is liberal Brahmanism. The rule reads as follows: "Actors, liquor-dealers, butchers, and other such sinners are not justified in following
such occupations, if they are not born to the professio7i (J.e, if
they are born to it they are justified in following their inher
ited occupation). Yet if one has inherited such a profession it is a noble thing to renounce it."^ The marks of Buddhistic influence on which we -njould lay greater stress are found not in the fact that Mudgala refuses
heaven (iii. 261. 43), or other incidents that maybe due as well to Brahmanism as to Buddhism, but in such passages of the pseudo-epical Book of Peace as for example the dharmyas panthas of xii. 322. 10-13; the conversation of the female beggar, bhikshukl, with the king in 321. 7, 168; the buddha of 289. 45 ; the Buddhistic phraseology of 167. 46 ; the remark of the harlot Pingala in 174. 60: pratibuddhd 'smi jagrmi (I am ' awakened ' to a sense of sin and knowledge of holiness),
and the like phrase in 177. 22: pratibuddho 'smi} Of especial importance is the shibboleth Nirvana which is often used in
the epic. There seems, indeed, to be a subtile connection
1 xii. 295. 5-6. 2 Noteworthy is the fact that parts of the Qivaite thirteenth book seem to be most Buddhistic (eh. i.; 143. 48, etc.), and monotheistic (16. 12 ff.); though the White Islanders are made Vishnuite in the twelfth. Compare Holtzmann, ad. loc.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 427
between Qivaism and Buddhism. Buddhism rejects pantheism, Civaism is essentially monotheism. Both were really religions
of the lower classes. It- is true that the latter was affected
and practiced by those of high rank, but its strength lay with the masses. Thus while Vishnuism appealed to the contemplative and philosophical (Ramaism), as well as to the easy-going
middle classes (Krishnaism), Qivaism with its dirty asceticism, its orgies and Bacchanalian revels, its devils and horrors generally, although combined with a more ancient philosophy,
appealed chiefly to the magic-monger and the vulgar. So it is
that one finds, as one of his titles in the thirteenth book, that
Civa is 'the giver of Nirvana,' (xiii. i6. 15). But if one
examines the use of this word in other parts of the epic he will see that it has not the true Buddhistic sense except in its literal physical application as when the ninidna (extinguish
ing) of a lamp, iv. 22. 22, is spoken of; or the nirvana of duties (in the Pancaratra ' Upanishad,' xii. 340. 67). On the Other hand, in sections where the context shows that this must be the case. Nirvana is the equivalent of ' highest bliss ' or 'highest brahma,' the same with the felicity thus named in
older works. This, for instance, is the case in xii. 21. 17; 26. 16, where Nirvana cannot mean extinction but absorption, i.e., the ' blowing out ' of the individual flame (spirit) of life, only
that it may become one with the universal spirit. In another passage it is directly equated with sukham bf-ahma in the same way (ib. 189. 17). If now one turn to the employment of this word in the third book he will find the case to be the same. When the king reproaches his queen for her atheistic opinions in iii. 31. 26 he says that if there were no reward for good deeds hereafter "people would not seek Nirvana," just as he speaks of heaven ('immortality') and hell, //;. 20 and ig, not
meaning thereby extinction but absorption. So after a description of that third heaven wherein is Vishnu, when one reads that Mudgala " attained that highest eternal bliss the



428 ' THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sign of -which is Nirvana" (iii. 261. 47), he can only suppose tiaat the word means here absorption into brahma or union with Vishnu. In fact Nirvana is already a word of which the sense has been subjected to attrition enough to make it synonymous with 'bliss.' Thus "the gods attained Nirvana by means of Vishnu's greatness" (iii. 201. 22); and a thirsty man " after drinking water attained Nirvana," i.e., the drink made him happy {ih. 126. 16). One may best compare the Jain
Nirvana of happiness. While, therefore, Buddhism seems to have left many manifest traces ^ in the later epic the weight of its influence on the
early epic may well be questioned. The moral harangues of the earlier books show nothing more than is consistent with that Brahminism which has made its way unaided through the greater humanitarianism of the earlier Upanishads. At the same time it is right to say that since the poem is composed
after Buddha's time there is no historical certainty in regard to the inner connection of belief and morality (as expounded in the epic) with Buddhism. Buddhism, though at a distance, environed epic Brahmanism, and may well have influenced it.
The objective proofs for or against this are not, however, decisive.
Whether Christianity has affected the epic is another question that can be answered (and then doubtfully) only by drawing a line between epic and pseudo-epic. And in this regard the Harivan^a legends of Krishna are to be grouped with the
pseudo-epic, of which they are the legitimate if late continuation. Again one must separate teaching from legend. To the Divine Song belong sentiments and phrases that have been ascribed to Christian influence. Dsfinitive assurance in this
regard is an impossibility. When Vishnu says (as is said also in the Upanishads) " I am the letter A," one may, and probably will, decide that this is or is not an imitation of " I am
1 Nirvana, loosely used ; termini technici ; possibly the evils of the fourth age ; the mention of (Buddhist) temples, etc.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 429
alpha," strictly in accordance with his preconceived opinions. There are absolutely no historical data to go upon. One may
say with tolerable certainty that the Divine Song as a whole is
antique, prior to Christianity. But it is as unmistakably in
terpolated and altered. The doctrine of bhakti, faithful love as
a means of salvation, cannot be much older than the Song, for it is found only in the latest Upanishads (as shown by comparing them with those undoubtedly old). But on the other hand the
prasada doctrine (of special grace) belongs to a much earlier literature, and there is no reason why the whole theory with
its startling resemblance to the doctrine of grace, and its insist
ence on personal affection for the Lord should not have been self-evolved. The old omnipotence of inherited knowledge stops with the Upanishads. To their authors the Vedas are but a means. They desired wisdom, not knowledge. They postulated the desire for the Supreme Spirit as the true wisdom. From this it is but a step to yearning and love for the Supreme. That step is made in the Divine Song. It is recognized by early Buddhism as a Brahmanic trait. Is it necessarily imported from Christianity ? The proof is certainly lacking. Nor, to one accustomed to the middle litera
ture of Hindu religion, is the phraseology so strikingly unique
as would appear to be the case. Taken all in all, the teaching of Christianity certainly may be suspected, but it cannot be shown to exist in the Divine Song. Quite different is the case with the miraculous matter that grew up about the infant Krishna. But here one is out of the
epic and dealing with the latest literature in regard to the man
god. This distinction cannot be too much insisted upon, for to point first to the teaching of the Divine Song and then to
the Krishna legends as equally reflecting Christianity is to
mix up two periods as distinct as periods can be established
in Hindu literature. And the result of the whole investigation
shows that the proofs of borrowing are as different as these



430 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
periods. The inner Christianity thought to be copied by the re-writer of the Divine Song is doubtful in the last degree.
The outer Christianity reflected in the Puranic legends of Krishna is as palpable as it is shocking. Shocking, for here
not only are miracles treated grotesquely, but everything that is meant spiritually in the Occident is interpreted physically and carnally. The love of the Bridegroom is sensual ; the brides of God are drunken dancing girls. The ' coincidences,' as some scholars marvellously regard them, between the legends of Christ and Krishna are too extraordinary to be accepted as such. They are direct importations, not accidental coincidences. Whatever is most marvel
lous in the accounts of Christianity finds itself here reproduced in Krishnaism. It is not in the doctrine of avatars, which re
sembles the doctrine of the Incarnation,^ it is in the totality of legends connected with Krishna that one is forced to see
Christian influence. The scenes of the nativity, the adoration of the magi, the miracles during the Saviour's childhood, the
transfiguration, and other .stories of Christ are reproduced with
astonishing similarity. One may add to this the Christmas
festival, where Krishna is born in a stable, and the use of cer
tain church-utensils in the temple-service. Weber has proved
by collecting and explaining these ' coincidences,' ^ that there must be identity of origin. It remains only to ask from which side is the borrowing ? Considering how late are these Krishna legends in India ^ there can be no doubt that the
1 On this point we agree neither with Weber, who regards the avatars as an imitation of the Incarnation {^Ind. St. ii. p. i6g), nor with Schroeder, who l^Literattir itnd Cutticr, p. 330) would derive the notion from tlie birtlvstories of Buddha. In our opinion the avatai'-theory is older than either and is often only an assimilation of outlying totem-gods to the Brahman's god, or as in the case of the flood-story the necessary belief that the ' fish ' must have been the god of the race. Some of these avatars are Brahmanic, presumably pre-Buddhistic. 2 Krishna's Geburtsfest {jamndstami), 1867. 3 Since they do not appear till after the real epic we date them tentatively as arising after 600 a.d. Most of them are in still later Purang,s.



HINDUISM. — VISHNU AND QIVA. 431
Hindu borrowed the tales, but not the name ; for the last assumption is quite improbable because Krishna (= Christ ?) is native enough, and Jishnu is as old as the Rig Veda. That these tales are of secondary importance, as they are of late origin, is a matter of course. They are excrescences upon real Vishnuism (Krishnaism) and the result of anthropomorphizing in its fullest extent the image of the man-god, who
is represented in the epic as the incarnation of the Supreme
Spirit. The doctrine of the incarnation is thoroughly Indie. It is Buddhistic as well as Brahmanic, and precedes Vishnuism
as it does Christianity. The legends are another matter.
Here one has to assume direct contact with the Occident.^ But while agreeing with Weber and disagreeing with Barth in the determination of the relation of this secondary matter, we are unable to agree with Weber in his conclusions in regard to the one passage in the pseudo-epic that is supposed by him ^ to refer to a visit to a Christian church in Alexandria. This is the famous episode of the White Island, which, to be sure, occurs
in so late a portion of the Book of Peace (xii. 337. 20 ff.) that
it might well be what Weber describes it as being. But to us
it appears to contain no allusion at all to. Christianity. The
account in brief is as follows ; Three priests with the insignificant names " First, Second, Third," ' go to the far North (dif uttara) where, in the " Sea of Milk," they find an Albion called "White Island," perhaps regarded as one of the seven or
thirteen 'islands,' of which earth consists; and there Vishnu
1 Incidental rapport with tlie Greelcs iias been pointed out in otlier instances ; the surangd^ a mine, of the late tale in i. 14S. 12, etc. {Ind. Si. ii. p. 395), has been equated with syrinx ; Skanda with Alexander, etc. It is needless to say that each of these is only a guess in etymology. But Greek influence is perceptible in the Greek soldiers and names of (Greek) kings that are found in the epic. 2 Ind. St. i. 423 ; ii. 169. Weber believes that little is native to India which resembles Christianity in the way of theology ; love of God, special grace, monotheism, all to him are stolen. We regret that we must disagree with him in these instances. 3 Ekata, Dvita, Trita. A Dvita appears as early as the Rig Veda. Ekata is an analogous formation and is old also.

is worshipped as the one god by white men of extraordinary
physical characteristics. The fact that the ' one god ' is already a hackneyed phrase of philosophy ; that there is no resemblance to a trinitarian god
;
that the hymn sung to this one god contains no trace of Chris
tian influence, but is on the other hand thoroughly native in
tone and phraseology, being as follows : " Victory to thee, thou
god with lotus-eyes ; Reverence to thee, thou creator of all things ; Reverence be to thee, O Vishnu;^ thou Great Person ; first-born one" ; all these facts indicate that if the Whiteislanders are indeed to be regarded as foreigners worshipping
a strange god, that god is strictly monotheistic and not trinita
rian. Weber lays stress on the expression 'first-born,' which
he thinks refers to Christ ; but the epithet is old /Vedic), and is common, and means no more than ' primal deity.' There is much that appears to be foreign in the epic. This passage seems rather to be a recollection of some shrine where monotheism without Christianity was acknowledged. On the other hand, even in the pseudo-epic, there is much apparently borrowed which yet is altogether native to Brahmanic land and sect. It is not in any passage which is proved to be of foreign origin that one reads of the boy of twelve years who entered among the wise men and confuted their reasoning (above, p.
382). It is not of course due to Christian influence that the great 'saint of the stake ' is taken by the 'king's men,' is cruci
fied (or literally impaled) among thieves, and lives so long that
the guard go and tell the king of the miracle ;^ nor is it necessary to assume that everything elevated is borrowed. "When I revile, I revile not again," sounds indeed like an echo of Christian teaching, but how thoroughly Hindu is the reason. " For I know that self-control is the door of immortality." And in the

Archaeologia, ' ancient lore,' is tlie meaning of Piirana
(^piirana, ' old '). The religious period represented by the extant
writings of this class is that which immediately follows the completion of the epic' These works, although they contain
no real history, yet reflect history very plainly, and since the advent and initial progress of Puranic Hinduism, with its various cults, is contemporary with important political changes, it will be necessary briefly to consider the circumstances in which arose these new creeds, for they were destined to become
in the future the controlling force in the development of Hindu
religion. In speaking of the extension of Buddhism we showed that its growth was influenced in no small degree by the fact that
this caste-less and, therefore, democratic religion was adopted by post-Alexandrine rulers in the Graeco-Bactrian period. At this time the Aryans were surrounded with foreigners and pagans. To North and South spread savage or half Hinduized native tribes, while soldiers of Greece and Bactria encamped in the valley of the Ganges. Barbarians had long been active in the
1 Parts of the epic are called Puranas, as other parts are called Upanishads. These are the forerunners of the extant Puranas. The name, indeed, is even older than the epic, belonging to the late Vedic period, where are grouped together Puranas and Itihasas, ' Ancient History ' and ' Stories ' ; to which are added ' Eulogies.' Weber has long since pointed out that even when the 'deeds of kings' were sung at a ceremony they were wont to be so embroidered as to iDe dubbed ' fiction ' by the Hindus themselves. India has neither literary history (save what can be gleaned from genealogies of doubtful worth), nor very early inscriptions. The 'archaeology' of the Puranas was probably always what it is in the extant specimens, legendary material of no direct historical value.

North, and some scholars have even claimed that Buddha's own family was of Turanian origin. The Brahmans then as
now retained their prestige only as being repositories of ancient
wisdom ; and outside of their own ' holy land ' their influence was reduced to a minimum by the social and political tendencies that accompanied the growth of Buddhism. After the fourth century B.C. the heart of India, the 'middle district,' between the Himalaya and Vindhya mountains from Delhi to Benares,^ was trampled upon by one Graeco-Bactrian horde
after another. The principal effect of this rude dominion was
eventually to give political equality to the two great rival
religions. The Buddhist and the Brahman lived at last if not
harmoniously, at least pacifically, side by side. Members of
the same reigning family would profess Buddhism or Brahmanism indifferently. One king would sometimes patronize both religions. And this continued to be the case till Buddhism faded out, replaced by that Hinduism which owed its origin . partly to native un-Aryan influence (paganism), partly to this
century-long fusion of the two state religions. To review these events : In the first decades of the fourth century (320 or 315-291 B.C.) Candragupta, Sandrocottos, had built up a monarchy in Behar ^ on the ruins left by the Greek invasion, sharing his power with Seleucus in the Northwest, and had thus prepared the way for his "grandson, Agoka, the great patron of Buddhism (264 or 259). This native power fell before the hosts of Northern barbarians, which, after irrup
tions into India in the second century, got a permanent foothold there in the first century B.C. These Northern barbarians
(their nationality is uncertain), whose greatest king was Ka
nishka, 78 a.d., ruled for centuries the land they had seized ; but they were vanquished at last in the sixth century, probably

by Vikramaditya,^ and were driven out. The breathing-space between Northern barbarian and Mohammedan was nominally not a long one, but since the first Moslem conquests had no
definitive result the new invaders did not quite overthrow Hindu
rule till the end of the tenth century. During this period the native un-Aryan tribes, with their Hinduizing effect, were more destructive as regards the maintenance of the old Brahmanic
cult than were outsiders.^ When Tamerlane invaded India his was the fourth invasion after the conquest of the Punjab by the Moslem in 664.^ In
1 So, plausibly, Miiller, loc. cii. below. 2 The tribes became Hinduized, their chiefs became Rajputs; their religions doubtless affected the ritual and creed of the civilized as much as the religion of the latter colored their own. Some of these un-Aryan peoples were probably part native, part barbaric. There is much doubt in regard to the dates that depend on accepted eras. It is not certain, for instance, that, as Miiller claims, Kanishka's inauguration coincides with the C^aka era, 78 a.d. A great Buddhist council was held under him. Some distinguished scholars still think with Biihler that Vikramaditya's inauguration was 57 K.c. (the date that used to be assigned to him). From our present point of view it is of little consequence when this king himself lived. He is renowned as patron of arts and as a conqueror of the barbarians. If he lived in the first century B.C. his conquest amounted to nothing permanent. What is important, however, is that all Vikramaditya stands for in legend must have been in the sixth century a,d. For the drama, of which he is said to have been patron, represents a religion distinctly later than that of the body of the epic (completed in the sixth or seventh century, Biihler, Indian Studies^ No. ii.). The dramatic and astronomical era was but introductory to KuTiarila's reassertion of Brahmanism in the seventh century, when the Northern barbarian was gone, and the Mohammedan was not yet rampant. In the rest of Northern India there were several native dynasties in different quarters, with different eras; one in Surashtra (Gujarat), one again in the 'middle district' or 'North Western Provinces,' one in Kutch; overthrown by Northern barbarians (in the fifth century) and by tlie Mohammedans (in the seventh and eighth centuries), respectively. Of these the Guptas of the ' middle district,' and the Valabhls of Kutch, had neither of the eras just mentioned. The former dated from 320-321 (perhaps 319), the latter from 190 (a.d.). The word samvat, * year,' indicates that the time is dated from either the Qaka or Vikramaditya era. See lA. xvii. 362; Fergusson, JRAS. xii. 259; Miiller, India, What Can It Teach Us? p. 2S2 ; Kielhorn, lA. xix. 24; xxii. III. The Northern barbarians are called Scythians, or Huns, or Turanians, according to fancy. No one really knows what they were. y The first host was expelled by the Hindus in 750. After a period of rest Mahmud was crowjied in 997, who overran India more than a dozen times. In the fol

1525 the fifth conqueror, Baber, fifth too in descent from Tam
erlane, founded the Mogul empire that lasted till the fall of this dynasty (nominally till 1857). But it must be remembered that each new conqueror from 997 till 1525 merely conquered old Mohammedan dynasties with new invasions. It was all one to the Hindu. He had the Mohammedan with hira all this time ; only each new rival's success made his lot the harder, But Baber's grandson, the Great Mogul, Akbar (who reigned from 1556 to 1605), gave the land not only peace but kindness ; and under him Jew, Christian, Hindu, and
Mohammedan at last forgot to fear or fight. After this there is only the overthrow of the Mohammedan power to record ; and the rise of the Mahratta native kingdoms. A new faith resulted from the amalgamation of Hinduism with Mohammedism (after 1500), as will be shown hereafter. In the pauses before the first Mohammedan invasion, and between the first defeat of the Mohammedans and their successful second conquest, the barbarians being now expelled and Buddhism being decadent, Brahmanism rallied. In the sixth century there was toleration for all faiths. In the seventh century Kumarila renewed the strength of Brahmanism on the ritualistic side with attacks on Buddhism, and in the ninth century Qankara placed the philosophy of unsectarian pantheism on a firm basis by his commentary on the Vedanta Sutra.^ These two men are the re-makers of ancient Brahmanism, which from this time on continued in its stereotyped form, adopting Hindu
lowing centuries tlie land was conquered and the people crushed by the second great Mohammedan, Ghori, wlio died in 1206, leaving his kingdom to a vassal, Kutab, the ' slave sultan ' of Delhi. In 1294, this slave dynasty having been recently supplanted, the new successor to the throne was slain by his own nephew, AUah-ud-din, who is reckoned as the third Mohammedan conqueror of India. His successor swept even the Dekhan of all its Hindu (temple) wealth ; but his empire finally broke down under its own size ; preparing the way for Timur (Tamerlane), who entered India in 1398. 1 (Jankara himself was not a pure Brahman. Both Vishnuites and (Jivaites lay claim to him.

gods very coyly, and only as spirits of small importance, ^while
relying on the laws as well as the gods of old, on holy acara or 'custom,' and the now systematized exposition of its old
(Upanishad) philosophy.^ Its creative force was already spent. Buddhism, on the other hand, was dying a natural death. The time was ripe for Hinduism, which had been gathering strength for centuries. After the sixth century, and perhaps even as late as 1500, or later, were written the modern Puranas, which embody the new belief.^ They cannot, on account of the distinct advance in their cult, have appeared before the end of the epic age. The breathing spell (between barbarian and complete Mohammedan conquest) which gave opportunity to Kumarila to take a high hand with Buddhism, was an opportu
nity also for the codification of the new creeds. It is, therefore,
to this era that one has probably to refer the first of the mod
1 Coy as was the Brahman in the adoption of the new gods he was wise enough to give them some place in his pantheon, or he would have offended his laity. Thus he recognizes Kali as well as (Jrl ; in fact he prefers to recognize tlie female divinities of the sects, for they offer less rivalry. 2 There was a general revival of letters antedating tlie Brahmanic theological revival. The drama, which reflects equally Hinduism and Brahmanism, is now the favorite light literature of the cultured. In the sixth century the first astronomical works are written (Varahamihira, who wrote the Brhat SamhitS), and the group of writers called the Nine Gems (reckoned of Vikramaditya's court) are to be referred to this time. The best known among them is Kalidasa, author of the ^akuntald. An account of this Renaissance, as he calls it, will be found in Miiller's India, What Can It Teach Us ? The learned author is perhaps a little too sweeping in his conclusions. It is, for instance, tolerably certain that the Bharata was completed by the time the ' Renaissance ' began ; so that there is no such complete blank as he assumes prior to Vikramaditya. But the general state of affairs is such as is depicted in the ingenious article referred to. The sixth and seventh centuries were eras that introduced modern literature under liberal native princes, who were sometimes not Rajputs at all. Roughly speaking, one may reckon from 500 B.C. to the Christian era as a period of Buddhistic control, Graeco-Bactrian invasion, and Brahmanic decline. The first five centuries after the Christian see the two religions in a state of equilibrium, under Scythian control, and the Maha-Bharata,the expanded Bharata, is written. From 500 to loco is an era of native rulers, Brahmanic revival in its pure form, and Hindu growth, with little trouble from the Mohammedans. Then for five centuries the horrors of Moslem conquest.



THE PURANAS. 439
ern sectarian Puranas, though the ritualistic Tantras and
Agamas of the lower Civaite sects doubtless belong rather to
the end than to the beginning of the period. We are strength
ened in this beHef by the fact that the oldest of these works do not pretend to antedate Kumarila's century, though the sects mentioned in the epic are known in the first centuries of the
Christian era. The time from the first to the seventh centuries one miy accordingly suppose to have been the era during which was developing the Brahmanized form of the early Hindu sects, the literature of these and subsequent sects being composed in the centuries succeeding the latter term. These sects again
divide into many subdivisions, of which we shall speak below. At present we take up the character of the Puranas and their most important points of difference as compared with the sec
tarian parts of the earlier pseudo-epic, examining especially the
trinitarian doctrine, which they inculcate, and its history.
Save in details, even the special ' faith-scriptures ' called Tantras go no further than go the Puranas in advocating the
cult of their particular divinities. And to this advocacy of
special gods all else in this class of writings is subordinated. The
ideal Purana is divided into five parts, cosmogony, new creations, genealogies of gods and heroes, manvantaras (descriptions of periodic ' ages,' past and future), and dynasties of kings. But
no extant Purana is divided thus. In the epic the doctrine of trinitarianism is barely formulated. Even in the Harivanga, or Genealogy, va/ifa, of Vishnu, there is no more than an inverted
triunity, 'one form, three gods,' where, in reality, all that is
insisted upon is the identity of Vishnu and Qiva, Brahma being, as it were, perfunctorily added.' In the Puranas, on the other
hand, while the trinity is acknowledged, religion is resolved
again into a sort of sectarian monotheism, where the devotee seems to be in the midst of a squabbling horde of temple-priests,
each fighting for his own idol. In the calmer aspects of religion,

440 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
apart from sectarian schism, tliese writings offer, indeed, much
that is of second-rate interest, but little that is of real value.
The idle speculations in regard to former divinities are here made cobweb thin. The philosophy is not new, nor is the spirit of religion raised, even in the most inspired passages, to the level which it has reached in the Divine Song. Some of these Puranas, of which eighteen chief are cited, but with an
unknown number of subordinate works,' may claim a respectable age ; many of them are the most wretched stuff imaginable,
bearing about the same literary and historical relation to earlier
models as do the later legal Smritis. In fact, save for their
religious (sectarian) purport, the Puranas for sections together do not differ much in content from legal Smritis, out of which
some may have been evolved, though, probably, they were from their inception legendary rather than didactic. It is more
probable, therefore, that they appropriated Smriti material
just as they did epic material ; and though it is now received
opinion that legal Smritis are evolved out of Sutras, this yet can be the case only with the oldest, even if the statement then can be accepted in an unqualified form. In our own opinion it is
highly probable tlfat Puranas and later legal Smritis are divergent developments from the same source.^ One gives an account
of creation, and proceeds to tell about the social side ; the other
sticks to the accounts of creation, goes on to theology, takes up
tales of heroes, introduces speculation, is finally wrenched over
to and amplified by sectarian writers, and so presents a composite that resembles epic and law, and yet is generally religious and speculative.
1 As the Jains have Angas and Upangas, and as the pseudo-epic distinguishes Nishads and Upanishads, so the Brahman has Puranas and Upapuranas (Kiirma Purana, i. p. 3). Some of tlie sects acknowledge only six Puranas as orthodox. 2 As an example of a Puranic Smriti (legal) we may cite the trash published as the Vrddha-Harita-Saiiihita Here there is polemic against (^iva; one must worship Jagannath with flowers, and every one must be branded with the Vishnu disc {cakrd). Even women and slaves are to use mantras, etc.



THE PURANAS. 441
A striking instance of this may be seen in the law-book of
'Vishnu.' Here there is an old base of legal lore, Sutra, inter
larded with Puranic material, and built up with sectarianism.
The writer is a Vishnuite, and while recognizing the trinity, does not hesitate to make his law command offerings to Krishna Vasudeva, and his family (Pradyumna, Aniruddha), along with the regular Brahmanic oblations to older spirits.' Brahmanism recognized Hindu deities as subordinate powers at an early date, at least as early as the end of the Sutra period ; while Manu not only recognizes Vishnu and Qiva (Hara), but recommends an oblation to Qri and Kali (Bhadrakali, here, as elsewhere, is Durga).^ In their original form the Puranas were probably Hesiodic in a great extent, and doubtless contained much that was afterwards specially developed in more prolix form in the epic itself. But the works that are come down as Puranas are in general of later sectarian character, and the epic language, phraseology, and descriptions of battles are more likely taken straight from the epic than preserved from ante-epic times. Properly speak
ing one ought to give first place to the Puranas that are incorporated into the epic. The epic Markandeya Purana, for instance, is probably a good type of one of the earlier works that went by this name. That the present Puranas are imita
tions of the epic, in so far as they treat of epic topics, may be presumed from the fact that although they often have the formulae intact of the battlefield,^ yet do they not remain by
epic descriptions but add weapons, etc., of more modern date
than are employed in the original.''
1 The lateness of this law-book is evident from its advocacy of suttee (xxv. 14), its preference for female ancestors (see below), etc. 2 Manu, iii. 89 ; xii. 121. 3 As, for example, in Kurma Purana, xvi. p. 186, where is found a common epic verse description of battle. ^ A good instance of this is found in Brihan Naradlya Purana, x., where the churika and drughana (24) appear in an imitative scene of this sort ; one of these being later, the other earlier, than the epic vocabulary.



442 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The sectarian monotheism of the Puranas never resulted in dispensing with tlie pantlieon. The Hindu monotlieist is a pan
theist, and whether sectarian or pliilosophical, he kept and added
to his pantheon.'- Indra is still for warriors, Maruts for husbandmen, although old views shift somewhat. So for example, in the Kurma Purana the Gandharvas are added for the Qudras." The fourfoldness, which we have shown in the epic to be characteristic of Vishnu, is now represented by the military epithet caturvyUhas (agmen quadratum), in that the god represents peace, wisdom, support, and renunciation ; though, as a matter
of fact, he is avyiiha, i.e., without any of these. ^ Starting with
the physical ' god of the four quarters,' one gets even in the
epic the ' controller of four,' or perfect person, conceived like
avrip TETpdyaivo's. Tennyson's ' four-square to all the winds that blow' is a good connecting link in the thought. The Puranas
are a mine of legend, although most of the stories seem to be
but epic tales, more or less distorted. Nala ' the great-greatgrandson of Rama ' is described after the history of Rama him
self ; the installation of Puru, when his father had passed over his eldest son, and such reminiscences of the epic are the stock
in trade of the legendary writers.*
The origin of the four castes ; ^ the descriptions of hell, some
1 Perhaps the most striking distinction between Vedic and Puranic, or, one may say. Indie Aryan and Hindu religions, is tlie emphasis laid in the former upon Right
;
in tlie latter, upon idols. The Vedic religion insists upon the law of right (order), that is, the sacrifice ; but it insists also upon right as rectitude, truth, holiness. Puranic Hinduism insists upon its idols; only incidentally does it recommend rectitude, truth, abstract holiness. " KP. i. p. 29. 3 Kiirma, xii. p. 102. Contrast zi. xxii. p. 245, caturvyuhadharo Vishiinr avyuhas procyate (elsewhere navavyuhd). Philosophically, in the doctrine of the epic Pahcaratras (still held by some sectaries), Vishnu is to be revered as Krishna, Balarama, Pradyumna, Aniruddha (Krishna's brother, son, and grandson), representing, respectively, dtmd, Jtva, supreme and individual spirit, perception, and consciousness. Compare Mbhii, xii. 340. 8, 72. ^ KP. xxi, p. 236 ; xxii. p. 238, etc. 5 lb. 1, p. 23.



THE PURANAS. 443
what embellished,^ where the 'sinful are cooked in fire';'^
the exaltation of Vishnu as Krishna or Rama in one, and that
of Qiva in another — these and similar aspects are reflections of
epic matter, spirit, tone, and language, only the faith is still
fiercer in religious matters, and the stories are fainter in histori
cal references. According to the Purana last cited: " There is no expiation for one that bows to a phallic emblem," i.e., Qivaite,
and "all the Bauddhas are heretics";^ and according to the Kurma Purana : " Vishnu is the divinity of the gods ; ^'^^j '^^ the devils," although the preceding verses teach, in the spirit of the Divine Song, that each man's divinity is that which he conceives to be the divinity. Such is the concluding remark made by Vasistha in adjudicating the strife between the Vishnuite
and ^ivaite sectaries of the epic heroes.* The relation that
the Puranic literature bears to religion in the minds of its authors
is illustrated by the remark of the Naradiya to the effect that the god is to be honored " by song, by music, by dance, and by recounting the P+iranas" (xvii. g). Some of the epic religious ceremonies which there are barely alluded to are here described with almost the detail of a tech
nical handbook. So the Naradiya (xix.) gives an elaborate ac
count of the raising of a dhvaja or standard as a religious
ceremony.'* The legal rules affecting morality and especially
caste-intercourse ^ show a laxity in regard to the rules as for
1 Compare Brihan Naradiya Purana. xiv. lo, bahiini hdsthaydntrdni (torture machines) in hell. The old tale of Naciketas is retold at great length in the Varaha Purana. The oldest Purana, the Markandeya, has but seven hells, a conception older than Manu's twenty-one (compare on MP. x. 80 ff., Scherman, loc. cit. p. 33), or the later lists of thousands. The Padma Purana, which celebrates Rama, has also seven hells, and is in part old, for it especially extols Pushkara (Brahma's lone shrine)
;
but it recommends the taptamiidra, or branding with hot iron. 2 Nar. xiv. 2. ^ xiv. 54 and 70. 4 KP. xxii. pp. 239-241. ^ As will be shown below, it is possible that this may be a ceremony first taken from the wild tribes. See the ' pole ' rite described above in the epic. G Compare for instance ib. xxviii. 68, on the strange connection of a Qudra wife of a Guru.



444 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
merly preached. Even the old Quranic form of the epic is reproduced, as when Markandeya converses again with Yudhistris, exactly as he does in the epic.^ The duration of the ages ;
the fruit of sacrifices, among which are still mentioned the
rdjasuya, a^vamedha, and other ancient rites ;
'^ the virtue of holy-places ; ^ the admixture of pure pantheism with the idea
of a personal creation "* — these traits are again just those which have been seen already in the epic, nor is the addition
of sections on temple-service, or other more minute details
of the cult, of particular importance in a history of religious
ideas. The Puranas for our present purpose may all be grouped with the remark that what is ancient in them is a more or less fugitive resemblance to the epic style and matter ; * what is new is the more pronounced sectarianism with its adventitious growth of subordinate spiritualities and exaggerated miracles. Thus for instance in the Varaha Parana there are eleven, vi\ the Bhagavat Purana twenty (instead of the older ten) avalars
of Vishnu. So too the god of love — although Kama and his
dart are recognized in the late Atharvan — as a petty spirit receives homage only in the latest Sutra (as Cupid, Apastamba,
ii. 2. 4. i), and in late additions to the epic he is a little god ; whereas in the drama he is prominent, and in the Puranas his cult is described at length (though to-day he has no temple). The 'mother '-fiend Putana, who suckles babes to slay them,
1 KP. xxxvi. It is of course impossible to say how much epic material is come from the literary epic and how much is drawn from popular poetry, for the vulgar had their own epoidic songs which may have treated of the same topics. Thus even a wild tribe (Gonds) is credited with an 'epic' But such stuff was probably as worthless as are the popular songs of to-day. 2 KP. XXX. p. 305 ; xxxvii. p. 352. a lb. p. 355. * Compare Naradlya, xi. 23, 27, 31 'the one whom no one knows,' ' he that rests in the heart,' ' he that seems to be far off because we do not know,' ' he whose form is Qiva, lauded by Vishnu,' xiii. 201. 5 Even Vishnu as a part of a part of the Supreme Spirit in VP. is indicated by Vishnu's adoration of dtmd in the epic (see above).



THE PURANAS. — EARLY SECTS. 445
is scarcely known to the early epic, but she is a very real personality in the late epic and Puranas.
The addition to the trinity of the peculiar inferior godhead that is advocated in any one Purana, virtually making four di
vinities, is characteristic of the period. In proportion as sectarian ardor is heightened religious tone is lowered. The Puranic votary clinging to his one idea of
god curses all them that believe in other aspects of the divin
ity. Blind bigotry fills the worshipper's soul. Religion becomes mere fanaticism. But there is also tolerance. Sometimes in one and the same Purana rival forms are honored. The modern Hindu sects are in part the direct development of Puranic doctrine. But most of the sects of to-day are of very recent date, though their principles are often of respectable
antiquity, as are too their sectarian signs, as well as the animals of their gods, some of which appear to be totems of the wild tribes, while others are merely objects of reverence among
certain tribes. Thus the ram and the elephant are respectively the ancient beasts of Agni and Indra. ^iva has the bull ; his spouse, the tiger. Earth and Skanda have appropriated the peacock, Skanda having the cock also. Yama has the buffalo
(compare the Khond, wild-tribe, substitution of a buffalo for a
man in sacrifice). Love has the parrot, etc.; while the boar and all Vishnu's animals in avatars are holy, being his chosen
beasts.-'
EARLY SECTS.
A classification of older sects (the unorthodox) than those of the present remains to us from the works of ^ankara's reputed disciple, Ananda Giri, and of Madhava Acarya, the former a
writer of the ninth, the latter of the fourteenth century. According to the statements made by these writers there were a great number of sects, regarded as partly heterodox or wholly
1 Compare Williams' BraJimanis-m and Hinduism.



446 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
SO, and it is interesting in examining the list of these to see
that some of the epic sects (their names at least) are still in
full force, while on the other hand the most important factions
of to-day are not known at all ; and that many sects then existed which must have been at that time of great antiquity, although now they have v/holly passed away.^ These last are indeed to the author of the critique of the sects not wholly heterodox.
They are only too emphatic, in worshipping their peculiar divinity, to suit the more modern conceptions of the Hindu reviewer. But such sects are of the highest importance, for they show
that despite all the bizarre bigotry of the Puranas the old Vedic gods (as in the epic) still continue to hold their own, and had their own idols and temples apart from other newer gods. The Vedic divinities, the later additions in the shape of the god of love, the god of wealth, Kubera,^ the heavenly bird,
Garuda, the v/orld-snake, Qesha, together with countless genii,
spirits, ghosts, the Manes, the heavenly bodies, stars, etc., all these were revered, though of less importance than the gods of Vishnuite and Qivaite sects. Among these latter the Qivaite
sects are decidedly of less interest than the corresponding Vish
nuite heresies, while .the votaries of Brahma (exclusively) are indeed mentioned, but they cannot be compared with those of the other two great gods.^ To-day there is scarcely any homage paid to Brahma, and it is not probable that there ever was the same devotion or like popularity in his case as in the case of
his rivals. Other interesting sects of this period are the Sunworshippers, who still exist but in no such numbers as when

Religious Thought and Life^ pp. 59, 62. 2 The two last are just recognized in Brahmanic legal works. 8 See Wilson's sketch of Hindu sects. The author says that there were in his day two shrines to Brahma, one in Ajmir (compare Pushkara in the epic), and one on the Ganges at Bithur. The Brahma Purana is known also as Saura (sun). This is the first in the list ; in its present state it is A'ishnuite.

sun, and others, all three as a iri-murti. Another division worshipped the sun in anthropomorphic shape, while the last awakens the wrath of the orthodox narrator by branding them
selves with hot irons.'
Gane5a,^ the lord of , Qiva's hosts, had also six classes of worshippers ; but he has not now as he then had a special and peculiar cult, though he has many temples in Benares and elsewhere. Of the declared Qivaite sects of that day, six are mentioned, but of these only one survives, the 'wandering' Jangamas of South India, the Qivaite Raudras, Ugras, Bhaktas, and Pagupatis having yielded to more modern sectaries. Some at least among the six sects of the Vishnuite sects, which are described by the old writers, appear to have been more ancient. Here too one finds Bhaktas, and with them the Bhagavatas, the old Pancaratras, the 'hermit' Vaikhanasas, and Karmahinas, the latter " having no rites." Concerning these sects one gets scanty but direct information. They all worshipped Vishnu under one form or another, the Bhaktas as Vasudeva, the Bhagavatas ^ as Bhagavat. The latter resembled the modern disciples of Ramanuja and revered the holy-stone, appealing for authority to the Upanishads and to the Bhagavad Gita, the Divine Song. Some too worshipped Vishnu exclu
1 Sun-worship (Iranian ?) is especially pronounced in the Bhavishya(t) Purana. Of the other Puranas the Linga is especially Qivaite {linga is phallus), as are the Matsya and older Vayu. Sometimes Qiva is androgynous, ardkanSri^vara, 'halffemale.' But most of the Puranas are Vishnuite. 2 On the Gane9a Purana see JRAS. 1846, p. 319. 3 The worshippers of Bhagavat were originally distinct from the Paiicaratras, but what was the difference between them is unknown. The sect of this name in the pseudo-epic is not (^akta in expression but only monotheistic. Probably the names of many sects are retained with altered beliefs and practices. The Vishnu Purana, i. II. 54, gives a model prayer which may be taken once for all as the attitude of the Vishnuite : " Glory to Vasudeva, him of perfected wisdom, whose unrevealed form is (known as) Brahma, Vishnu, and Qiva" (Hiranyagarbha, Purusha, Pradhana).

sively as Narayana, and believed in a heaven of sensual delights. The other sects, now extinct, offer no special forms of worship.
What is historically most important is that in this list of sects
are found none that particularly worship the popular divinities
of to-day, no peculiar cult of Krishna as an infant and no monkey-service.
Infidel sects are numerous in this period, of which sects the
worst in the old writers' opinion is the sensual Carvaka. Then follow the (Buddhist) ^unyavads, who believe In 'void,' and
Saugatas, who believe that religion consists only in kindness, the Kshapanakas, and the Jains. The infamous ' left-hand
'
sectaries are also well known.
To one side of the Puranic religions, from the earlier time of which comes this account of heresies, reference has been made
above: the development of the fables in regard to the infant Krishna. That the cult is well known in the later Puranas and is not mentioned in this list of wrong beliefs seems to show that the whole cult is of modern growth, even if one does not follow Weber in all his signs of modification of the older
practice.
RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS.
For the history of the cult there is in these works much to interest one in the description and determination of popular
festivals in honor of the great sectarian gods. Further details of more specific nature are given in other works which need not here be regarded. By far the most important of these festivals are those that seem to have been .absorbed by the sectarian cults, although they were originally more popular. Weber in the paper on the rdjasUya, to which we have had occasion several times to refer, has shown that a popular element abided long in the formal celebrations of the Brahmanic ritual.^
1 Weber shows for instance, loc. cii., that Indra takes the place of older Varuna
;
that the house-priest yields to the Brahma ; that in this feast in honor of the king he

Undoubtedly the original celebration was a popular one. To
day the most interesting of these popular fetes is in all respects
the New Year's Festival and the Spring Festival. The latter has been cut up into several parts, and to show the whole intent of thp original ceremonial it is necessary to take up the disjecta membra and place them side by side, as has been done by Wilson, whose sketch of these two festivals, together with that by Gover of the New Year's Feast called Pongol, we give in abstract, premising that, however close be the comparison with European festivals of like nature, we doubt whether there is any historical connection between them and the Hindu
celebrations. We begin with the more popular New Year's, the Pongol:^
The interesting feature of this South India festival is that
the Hindus have done their best to alter its divinities and failed. They have, indeed, for Indra and Agni got Krishna formally accepted as the god in whose honor it is supposed
to be held, but tiie feast remains a native festival, and no one really thinks of the Puranic gods in connection with it. Europe also has seen such dynamic alterations of
divinities in cases where feasts would persist till patrons of an orthodox kind were foisted upon them to give an air of propriety to that which remained heathenish.^ The Pongol is a
New Year's festival lasting for three days. The first day is for
Indra; the second, for (Agni) Surya;^ the third (to which is
is soundly beaten ; that gaming creeps into tlie ceremony as a popular aspect ; that there was a special ceremony to cure kaizenjammcr caused by over-drinking ; and that the whole ceremony was a popular spring festival, such as is found to-day (but without the royal part in the play). 1 Gover, JRAS. v. 91 ; I A. xx. 430. 2 In Hinduism itself there is a striking example of this.. The Jagannath (' Juggernaut ') temple was once dedicated to Buddha as loka-ndth or Jagan-ndih^ ' saviour of the world.' Name, temple, and idol-car are now all Vishnu's

well. If it does so a universal shout arises,' all rush about,
congratulate, and give presents to each other, and merry
making follows. On the cattle-days the beasts are led about with painted horns and decorated with ribbons, and are then chased and robbed by the boys. The image of Ganega is the only one seen, and his worship is rather perfunctory. On the evening of the last day the women have a party, paying obeisance to a peacock, and indulging in a family reunion of very
simple character. On this occasion the girl-wife may return for a few hours to her mother. It is the only general f^te for women during the year. Not unlike this festival of the extreme south is the New
Year's celebration at the mouth of the Ganges. Here there is
a grand fair and jewels are cast into the river as propitiation to the river-goddess. Not long ago it was quite customary to fling children also into the river, but this usage has now been
abolished.^ Offerings are made to the Manes, general and
particular, and to the All-gods. As with the Pongol, the feast is one of good-fellowship where presents are distributed, and its
limit is the end of the third day. After this the festivities

Before it has had time to run down the blackened sides, the air resounds with the sudden joyous cry of ' Pongol, oh Pongol, SCrya, Surya, oh Pongol.' The word Pongol means " boiling," from the Tamil word pongii, to boil ; so that the joyous shout is, ' It boils, oh Sarya, it boils.' In a moment a convulsion of greetings animates the assembly. Every one seizes his neighbor and asks, ' Has it boiled ?' Both
faces gleam with delight as the answer comes — ' It has boiled.' Then both shout at
the top of their voices — ' Oh Pongol, Pongol, oh Surya, oh Indra, Pongol, Pongol.'

have no religious character. Thousands of pilgrims assemble for this f^te. Wilson, who gives an account of this celebration, compares the ancient Roman New Year's, with the mutui antoris pignora which were sent at that season. The gifts in
India are sweetmeats and other delicacies, ominous of good
for the next year.' On the 2d of February occurs a feast to Qri, or Lakshmi, Vishnu's bride, patroness of all prosperity to her worshippers.
At present it is a literary festival on which all books, inkstands, pens, etc., are cleaned and worshipped, as adjuncts to Sara
svati, the goddess of learning. This is rather significant, for
Sarasvati is properly the wife of Brahma, but the Vishnuites of Bengal have made her the wife of Vishnu, and identified her
with Qrl. It is to be noticed that in this sole celebration of
abstract learning and literature there is no recognition of Qiva, but rather of his rival. Qiva and Ganega are revered because they might impede, not because, as does Sarasvati, they further literary accomplishment. Sarasvati is almost the only fair goddess. She is represented not as a horror, but as a beautiful woman sitting on a lotus, graceful in shape, a crescent on her
brow.^ The boys, too, celebrate the day with games, bat and ball, prisoner's base, and others " of a very European charac
ter." The admixture of sectarian cults is shown by the trans
ference to this Vishnuite feast of the Qivaite (Durga) practice
1 A feast now neglected, though kept up by strict Brahmans, occurs on or about the 2oth January. The orthodox adherents of the Qivaite sects and Qaktas also observe it. It is a (^raddha, or funeral feast to the Manes. Also on the 26th and 30th January there are rites nearly obsolete, the first being signalized by offerings to Varna; the second, a (^ivaite feast (to his spouse, as 'giver of bridegrooms'). The last is more celebrated in the Soutli than in the North. It is interesting chiefly as a parallel to St. Valentine's day, or, as Wilson says, the nearer feast of St. Agnes (21st January), on the eve of which divination is practiced to discover future husbands. It is this time also that the Greeks call ' marriage-month ' (Gamelion) ; and the fourth day from the new moon (which gives the name to this Hindu festival, caturtlii, " fourth day ") is the day when Hesiod recommends the bringing home of the bride. " In case any writing has to be done on this day it is done with chalk, not with the pens, " which have a complete holiday'' (Wilson).

of casting into the river the images of the goddess.^ When apphed distinctly to Saras vati the feast is observed in AugustSeptember ; when to Lakshmi, in October-November, or in February. There is, however, another feast, celebrated in the North and South, which comes on the exact date fixed by the Romaiis for the beginning of spring, and as an ending to this there is a feast to Kama, Cupid, and his bride Rati (' Enjoyment '). This is the Vasanta, or spring festival of prosperity and love, which probably was the first form of the Lakshmi
Sarasvati feast. Another traditional feast of this month is the loth^ (the
eleventh lunar day of the light half of Magha). The eleventh lunar day is particularly holy with the Vishnuites, as is said in the Brahma Purana, and this is a Vishnuite festival. It is a
day of fasting and prayer, with presents to priests.'' It appears to be a mixture of Vedic prayers and domestic Vishnu-worship. On the nth of February the fast is continued, and in both the
object is expiation of sin. The latter is called the feast of ' six
sesamum acts,' for sesamum is a holy plant, and in each act of
this rite it plays a part. Other rites of this month are to the Manes on the 14th, 22d, and 24th of February. Bathing and
oblation are requisite, and all are of a lustral and expiatory nature. Wilson remarks on the fact that it is the same time of year in which the Romans gave oblations to the Manes, and
1 The invocations show very well how the worship of Brahma has been driven out in honor of his more powerful rivals. For Sarasvatl is invoked first as " Thou without whom Brahma never lives " ; but again as " Thou of eight forms, Lakshmi, Medha, Dhava, Pushtl, Gauri, Tushtl, Prabha, Dhriti, Sarasvati." The great festivals, like the great temples, are not very stricty sectarian. Williams says that in Qiva's temple in Benares are kept monkeys (sacred to Vishnu). 2 Between this and the last occur minor holidays, one to avert small-pox ; one (February the 4th) sacred to the sun (Sui^day, the seventh day of each lunar fortnight, is strictly observed) ; and one to the Manes. 3 Fasting is not necessarily a part of civilized religion alone. It is found in the Brahmanic and Hindu cults, but it obtains also aniong the American Indians. Thus the Dacotahs fast for two or three days at the worship of sun and moon.

that Februus is the god of purification. " There can be no reasonable doubt that the FeraHa of the Romans and the (Jraddha (feast to the Manes) of the Hindus, the worship of the Pitris and of the Manes, have a common character, and had a common origin," ^
The 27th of February is the greatest Qivaite day in the year. It celebrates Qiva's first manifestation of himself in phallic form. To keep this day holy expiates from all sin, and secures
bliss hereafter. The worshipper must fast and revere the Linga. Offerings are made to the Linga. It is, of course, a
celebration formed of unmeaning repetitions of syllables and
the invocation of female Qaktis, snapping the fingers, gesticu
lating, and performing all the humbug called for by Qivaite worship. The Linga is bathed in milk, decorated, wrapped in bilva leaves, and prayed to ; which ceremony is repeated at
intervals with slight changes. All castes, even the lowest, join in the exercises. Even women may use the mantras? Vigil
and fasting are the essentials of this worship.^
The next festival closes these great spring celebrations. It
bears two names, and originally was a double feast, the first part being the Dola Yatra, or ' Swing-procession,' the second part being the execrable Holi. They are still kept distinct in
some places, and when this occurs the Dolotsava, or Dola Yatra, follows the Holi. They are both spring festivals, and answer roughly to May-day, though in India they come at the full moon of March. We have followed Wilson's enumeration of all the minor spring feasts, that they may be seen in their

On the 1 5th of March there is another minor festival in Bengal, but it is to C^iva, or rather to one of his hosts, under the form of a water pot (that is to preserve from disease).

entirety. But in ancient times there was probably one long Vasantotsava (spring-festival), which lasted for weeks, beginning with a joyous celebration (2d of February) and continuing with lustral ceremonies, as indicated by the now detached feast
days already referred to. The original cult, in Wilson's opinion,
has been changed, and» the Dola Yatra is now given over to the Krishna-cult, while the Holi divinity is a hobgoblin. The Dola Yatra begins with fasting and ends (as Holi) with fire-worship. An image of Krishna is sprinkled with red powder (abtr), and
after this (religious) ceremony a bonfire ^ is made, and an effigy, Holika, is put upon it and burned. The figure is carried to
the fire in a religious procession headed by Vishnuite or Brahman priests, of course accompanied with music and song. After seven circumambulations of the fire the figure is burned. This is the united observance of the first day. At dawn on the morning of the second day the image of Krishna is placed in a swing, dola, and swung back and forth a few times, which ceremony is repeated at noon and at sunset. During the day, wherever a swing is put up, and in the vicinity, it is the common privilege to sprinkle one's friend with the red powder or red rose-water. Boys and common people run about the streets sprinkling red water or red powder over all passengers, and using abusive (obscene) language. The cow-herd caste is con
spicuous at this ceremony. The cow-boys, collecting in parties
under a koryphaios, hold, as it were, a komos, leaping, singing, and dancing '^ through the streets, striking together the wands which they carry. These cow-boys not only dress (as do others)
in new clothes on this occasion,^ but they give their cattle new
^ The bonfire is made of fences, doorposts, furniture, etc. Nothing once seized and devoted to the fire may be reclaimed, but the owner may defend his property if lie can. Part of the horse-play at this time consists in leaping over the fire, which is also ritualistic with some of the hill-tribes. 2 Compare the Nautch dances oir Ramacandra's birthday. Religious dances, generally indecent, are also a prominent feature of the religions of the wild tribes (as among American and African savages, Greeks, etc., etc.). 3 The ' Easter bonnet ' in Indie form.

equipments, and regard the whole frolic as part of a religious rite in honor of Krishna, the cow-herd. But all sects take part
in the performance (that is to say, in the Holi portion), both
Qivaites and Vishnuites. When the moon is full the celebra
tion is at its height. Holi songs are sung, the crowd throws
abir, the chiefs feast, and an all-night orgy ends the long
carousal.^ In the south the Dola takes place later, and is distinct from the Holi. The burning here is of Kama, commemorating the love-god's death by the fire of Qiva's eye, when the former pierced the latter's heart, and inflamed him with love. For this reason the bonfire is made before a temple of Qiva. Kama is gone from the northern cult, and in
upper India only a hobgoblin, Holi, a foul she-devil, is associated with the rite. The whole performance is described and prescribed in one of the late Puranas.^ In some parts of the country the bonfire of the Holi is made about a tree, to which offerings are made, and afterwards the whole is set on fire. For a luminous account of the Holi, which is perhaps the worst open rite of Hinduism, participated in by all sects and classes, we may cite the words of the author of Ante-Brahmanical Religions : " It has been termed the Saturnalia or Carnival of the Hindus. Verses the most obscene imaginable are ordered to be read on the occasion. Figures of men.and .women, in the most indecent and disgusting attitudes, are in many places openly paraded
through the streets ; the most filthy words are uttered by persons who, on other occasions, would think themselves disgraced by the use of them; bands of men parade the street with their clothes all bespattered with a reddish dye ; dirt and filth are
1 In sober contrast stands the yearly orthodox (^raddha celebration (AugustSeptember), though Brahmans join in sectarian fetes. 2 Wilson draws an elaborate parallel between the Holi and the Lupercalia, etc. (Carnival). But the points of contact are obvious. One of the customs of the Holi celebration is an exact reproduction of April-Fool's day. Making " Holi fools " is to send people on useless errands, etc. (Festum Stultorum, at the Vernal Equinox, transferred by the Church to the first of November, " Innocents' Day ").



456 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
thrown upon all that are seen passing along the road ; all busi
ness is at a stand, all gives way to license and riot." ^
Besides these the most brilliant festivals are the Ras Yatra in Bengal (September-October), commemorating the dance of Krishna'with the ^(7/14- or milk-maids, and the 'Lamp-festival'
(Dipala), also an autumnal celebration. The festivals that we have reviewed cover but a part of the
year, but they will suffice to show the nature of such fetes as are enjoined in the Puranas. There are others, such as the
eightfold ^ temple-worship of Krishna as a child, in July or August ; the marriage of Krishna's idol to the Tulasi plant
;
the Awakening of Vishnu, in October, and so forth. But no others compare in importance with the New Year's and Spring
festivals, except the Bengal idol-display of Jagannath, the Rath Yatra of 'Juggernaut'; and some others of local celebrity, such as the Durga-puja.' The temples, to which reference has often been made, have this in common with the great Qivaite
festivals, that to describe them in detail would be but to trans
late into words images and wall-paintings, the obscenity of which
is better left undescribed. This, of course, is particularly true
of the (Jiva temples, where the actual Linga is perhaps, as Barth has said, the least objectionable of the sights presented to the eye of the devout worshipper. But the Vishnu temples are as bad. Architecturally admirable, and even wonderful, the interior is but a display of sensual immorality.'
1 Stevenson, JRAS. 1841, p. 239; Williams, loc. cit.; Wilkins, Afoafcr;; Hinduism, cli. iii. 2 The daily service consists in dressing, bathing, feeding, etc. It is divided into eight ridiculous ceremonies, which prolong the worship through the day. 3 The brilliant displays attracted the notice of the Greeks, who speak of the tame tigers and panthers, the artificial trees carried in wagons, the singing, instrumental music, and noise, which signalized a fete procession. See Williams, loc. cit. 4 Such, for instance, is the most holy temple of South India, the great temple of Qrirangam at Trichinopoly. The idol car, gilded and gaudy, is carved with obscenity
;
the walls and ceilings are frescoed with bestiality. It represents Vishnu's heaven.



HISTORY OF THE HINDU TRINITY. 457
HISTORY OF THE HINDU TRINITY.
In closing the Puranic period (which name we employ loosely to cover such sects as are not clearly modern) we pause for a moment to cast a glance backwards over the long development of the trinity, to the units of which are devoted the individual Puranas. We have shown that the childhood-tales of Krishna are of late (Puranic) origin, and that most of the
cow-boy exploits are post-epic. Some are referred to in the story of Qi^upala in the second book of the Mahabharata, but this scene has been touched up by a late hand. The Vishnu Purana, typical of the best of the Puranas, as in many respects it is the most important and interesting, represents Krishnaite
Vishnuism as its height. Here is described the birth of the man-god as a black, krsna, baby, son of Nanda, and his real title is here Govinda, the cow-boy.' ' Cow-boy ' corresponds to the more poetical, religious shepherd ; and the milk-maids, gopls, with whom Govinda dallies as he grows up, may, perhaps, better be rendered shepherdesses for the same reason.
The idyllic effect is what is aimed at in these descriptions. Here Krishna plays his rude and rustic tricks, upsetting wagons, overthrowing trees and washermen, occasionally killing them he dislikes, and acting altogether much like a cow-boy
of another sort. Here he puts a stop to Indra-worship, overpowers Q!iva, rescues Aniruddha, marries sixteen thousand
princesses, burns Benares, and finally is killed himself, he the one born of a hair of Vishnu, he that is Vishnu himself, who in
' goodness ' creates, in ' darkness ' destroys,^ under the forms of Brahma and Qiva.^
1 From this name or title comes the Gita Govinda, a mystic erotic poem (in praise of tlie cow-boy god) as exaltedly religious as it is sensual (twelfth century). 2 VP. i. ^. 63. The ' qualities' or ' conditions' of God's being are referred to by ' goodness ' and ' darkness.' 3 All this erotic vulgarity is typical of the common poetry of the people, and is in marked contrast to the chivalrous, but not love-sick, Bharata.



458 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
In Vishnu, as a development of the Vedic Vishnu ; in Qiva, as affiliated to Rudra ; in Brahma, as the Brahmanic third to
these sectarian developments, the trinity has a real if remote connection with the triune fire of the Rig Veda, a two-thirds
connection, filled out with the addition of the later Brahmanic
head of the gods. To ignore the fact that Vishnu and Rudra-^iva developed inside the Brahmanic circle and increased in glory before the
rise of sectaries, and to asseverate, as have some, that the two
chief characters of the later trinity are an unmeaning revival of decadent gods, whose names are used craftily to veil the mod
ernness of Krishnaism and Qivaism, — this is to miscalculate the waxing dignity of these gods in earlier Brahmanic literature. To say with Burnouf that the Vishnu of the Veda is not at all the Vishnu of the mythologists, is a statement far too sweeping. The Vishnu of the Veda is not only the same god with the Vishnu of the next era, but in that next era he has become greatly magnified. The Puranic All-god Vishnu stands in as close a relation to his Vedic prototype as does Milton's Satan to the snaky slanderer of an age more primitive. Qiva-worship appears to have been adapted from a local cult in the mountainous West, and at an early date to have been amalgamated with that of his next resemblance, the Vedic Rudra ; while Krishna-worship flourished along the Ganges. These are those Dionysos and Herakles of whom speak the old
Greek authorities. One cult is possibly as venerable as the other, but while Qivaism became Brahmanized early, Krish
naism was adopted much later, and it is for this reason,
amongst others, that despite its modern iniquities Qiva has appealed more to the Brahman than has Krishna. Megasthenes tells us a good deal about these Hindu representatives of Herakles and Dionysos. According to him there were Dionysiac festivals in honor of the latter god (Qiva)/ who
1 Compare Duncker, iu.5 p. 327. More doubtful is the identification of Nysian and

belongs where flourishes the wine, in the Agvaka district, north of the Kabul river. From this place Qiva's worship extended into the East, Magadha (Behar), around Gokarna in the West, and even to the Kalinga country in the extreme Southeast. But it was especially native to the mountainous Northwest, about the ' Gate of Ganges ' (north of Delhi, near Saharampur),
and still further north in Kashmeer. In the epic, Qiva has his throne on Kailasa,^ the Northern mountain, in the 'Himalayas, and Ganges descend from the sky upon his head. On the other hand, Herakles, of the Ganges land, where grows no wine, is plainly Krishna, who carries £lub, discus, and conch. The Greek cities Methora and Kleisobora are Mathura and Krishna-pur, 'Krishna-town'; the latter on the Jumna, the former near it on the same river, capital of the clan which venerated Krishna as its chief hero and god, the Yadavas. Megasthenes says, also, that Herakles' daughter is Pandaie, and this agrees with the Pandya, a southern development of the epic Gangetic Pandavas, who especially worship Krishna in conjunction with the Yadavas. Their South-Indic town,
Mathura, still attests their origin.
In speaking of the relative antiquity of Vishnuism and ^ivaism one must distinguish the pantheistic form of these gods
from the single forms. While Qivaism, per se, that is, the worship of Qiva as a great and terrible god, preceded the same
exaltation of Krishna, as is shown by their respective literary appearance, and even by Megasthenes' remark that the worship of Dionysos preceded that of Herakles by fifteen generations, yet did Krishnaism, as a popular pantheism, come before Qivaism as such. Although in the late Qvetagvatara Upanishad
Qiva is pantheistic, yet is he not so in the epic till some of the
Nishadan, «i}. note. Compare, also, Schroeder, loc. cit. p. 361, Arrian calls ((J^Ivl) Dionysos the otvav SoT-ijpa 'lud-ns (Schwanbeck, Frg. L). 1 This remains always as Qiva's heaven in distinction from Goloka or Vaikuntha, Vishnu's heaven. Nowadays Benares is the chief seat of Qivaism,

latest passages make him the All, in imitation of Krishna as All-god. Probably Qivaism remained by the first philosophy, Sinkhyan dualism, and was forced into Krishna's Vedantic
pantheism, as this became popular. At first neither was more than a single great god without any philosophy.^ In one of the early exegetical works, which is occupied some
what with philosoghical matter, there is evidence that a triad
existed between the Vedic triad of fires and the Puranic triad.
Fire, Wind (or Indra), and the Sun (Surya), are stated in a famous passage to be the only real gods, all the others being bat names of th&se. But, although in form this triad (Nirukta,
vii. 4, 5) is like the Vedic triad,^ it is essentially a triad in a
pantheistic system like that of the epic and Puranas, for it is addsd that " all the gods are parts of one soul." In explana
tion it is said : " Fire is the earth-god, Wind, or Indra, is the god of the atmosphere, and the sun is the god of the sky." Now in the Rig Veda Indra is closely united not only with Agni but with Vishnu, albeit in this period Vishnu is his sub
ordinate. The nearest approach of this Vishnu to his classical descendant is in one of the latest hymns of the Rig Veda, where it is said that the seven seeds of creation are Vishnu's, as in later times he comprises seven males. In the philosophy of
the Taittiriya Samhita the three places of Vishnu are not, as in the Rig Veda, the two points of the horizon (where the sun
sets) and the zenith, but 'earth, air, and sky.'" That is to
say, in the Brahmanic period Vishnu is already a greater god than he had been. Nay, more, he is explicitly declared to be
1 The doctrine of the immaculate conception, common to Vishnuism and Buddhism (above, p. 431), can have no exact parallel in Qivaism, forQiva is not born as a child; but it seems to be reflected in the laughable ascription of virginity to Uma (Civa's wife), when she is revered as the emblem of motherhood. 2 In RV. V. 41. 4, the Vedic triad is Fire, Wind, and(Trita of the sky) Indra ; elsewhere Fire, Wind, and Sun (above, p. 42), distinct from the triune fire. 3 In the Rig Veda the three steps are never thus described, but in the later age this view is common. It is, in fact, only on tlie 'three steps' that the identity with the sun is established. In RV. i. 156. 4, Vishnu is already above Varuna.



HISTORY OF THE HINDU TRINITY. 461
"the best of the gods.'" That best means greatest may be shown from the same work, where in savage fable it is recited that all the gods, including Indra, ran up to him to get his
strength.^ But especially in the Upanishads is Vishnu the one great god left from the Rig Veda. And it is with the philosophical (not with the ritualistic) Vishnu that Krishna is equated.
Of Qiva, on the other hand, the prototype is Rudra ('red'), his constant sobriquet. In the Rig Veda he is the god of red lightning, who is the father of the Maruts, the storm-gods.
His attributes of a fulgurant god are never lost. Even as Qiva the All-god he is still the god of the blue neck, whose threeforked trident and home among the mountains remind us of
his physical origin. He is always the fairest of the gods, and
both early and late he is terrible, to be averted by prayer, even where his magic ' medicines ' are asked for. To him are addressed the most suppliant cries : " O Rudra, spare us, strike not the men, slay not the kine." In the Atharva Veda at
every step one finds characteristics which on the one hand are but exaggerations of the type formulated in the Rig Veda, and on the other precursors of the signs of the later god. In Qivaism, in contradistinction to Vishnuism, there is not a
trace of the euhemerism which has been suspected in the Krishna-Vishnu cult. The Rudra of the Rig Veda already
begins to be idfentified with the triune fire, for he bears the
standing epithet of fire, "he of three mothers." '' And this name he keeps, whether as Rudra, who is "brilliant as the sun" (RV. i. 43. 5), whose weapon is "the shining one that is emitted from the sky and passes along the earth " (ib. vii. 46. 3) ;
or again, as the " red boar of the sky," the " holder of the bolt
"
{ib. ii. 2iZ- 3); and, above all gods, "the terrible" (x. 126. 5).

Coming to the Brahmanic period one finds him a dweller in the mountain tops, of a red color, with a blue neck, the especial lord of the mountains, and so of robbers ; while he is also
the ' incantation-god,' the ' god of low people.' Some of these are Rudra's attributes ; but here his name is already Qiva, so
that one may trace the changes down the centuries till he finds
again in the epic that Qiva is the lord of mountains, the patron of thieves (Hara, robber ?), and endowed with the trident, the
blue neck,^ and the three mothers of old. In the middle period he has so many titles thaj; one probably has to accept in the subsequent Qiva not only the lineal descendant of the Vedic Rudra, but also a combination of other local cults, where
clan gods, originally diverse, were worshipped as one in conse
quence of their mutual likeness. One of the god's especial names is here Bhava, while in the earlier period Bhava and Rudra are distinct, but they are invoked as a pair (AV).^ What gives Civa his later tremendous popularity, however, is the feature to which we have alluded in the chapter on the
epic. In the epic, all the strength of Qiva lies in the Linga.''
Both Bhava and Rudra, as Qarva, the archer— his local east
ern name — are represented as hurling the lightning, and it is
simply from identity of attributes that they have become iden
tified in person (AV. x. i. 23). Rudra's title of Pagupati, or 'lord of cattle ' * goes back to the Vedic age : " Be kind to the kine of him who believes in the gods " is a prayer of the Atharva Veda (xi. 2. 28). Agni and Rudra, in the Rig-Veda,

The theological interpretation is that <^iva is the lord of the spirit, which is bound like a beast.



HISTORY OF THE HINDU TRINITY. 463
are both called 'cattle-guarding,' but not for the same reason.
Agni represents a fire-stockade, while Rudra in kindness does
not strike with his lightning-bolt. The two ideas, with the iden
tification of Rudra and Agni, may have merged together. Then too, Rudra has healing medicines (his magical side), and Agni is kindest to men. All Agni's names are handed over in the Brahmanas to Rudra-Q^iva, just as Rudra previously had taken
the epithets of Pushan (above), true to his robber-name. To ignore the height to which" at this period is raised the form of
Rudra-Qiva is surely unhistorical ; so much so that we deem it doubtful whether Qliva-invocations elsewhere, as in the Sutra
referred to above, should be looked upon as interpolations. In the Maitrayani Collection, the Rudrajapas, the invocations
to Rudra as the gr-eatest god, the highest spirit, the lord of beings (Bhava), are expressly to Qiva Giri^a, the mountainlord (2. 9 ; Schroeder, p. 346). In the Aitareya Brahmana it evidently is Rudra-Qiva, the god of ghastly forms (made by the
gods, it is said, as a composite of all the ' most horrible parts
'
of all the gods), who is deputed to slay the Father-god (when the latter, as a beast, commits incest with his daughter), and
chooses as his reward for the act the office of ' lord of cattle.'
'
This is shown clearly by the fact that the fearsome Rudra is changed to the innocuous Rudriya in the next paragraph. As an example of how in the Brahmanas Rudra-^iva has taken to himself already the powers of Agni, the great god of the
purely sacrificial period, may be cited ^at. Br. vi. i. 3. 10 and 2. I. 12. Here Agni is Kumara, Rudra, Qarva (Sarva^), Pagu
1 The commenter, horrified by the murder of the Father-god, makes Rudra kill ' the sin ' ; but the original shows that it is the Father-god who was shot by this god, who chose as his reward the lordship over kine ; and such exaltation is not improbable (moreover, it is historical !). The hunting of the Father-god by Rudra is pictured in the stars (Orion), Ait. Br. iii. 33. 2 See Weber, Ind. St. ii. 37 ; Muir, iv. 403. (^arva (Qaurva) is Avestan, but at the same time it is his ' eastern ' name, while Bhava is his western name. (Jat. Br.

464 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
pati (lord of beasts), Bhairava (terrible), Agani (lightning),
Bhava (lord of beings), Mahadeva (great god), the Lord — his ' thrice three names.' But where the Brahmana assumes that these are names of Agni it is plain that one has Rudra-Qiva
in process of absorbing Agni's honors. The third element in the Puranic trinity,^ identified with the
Father-god, genealogically deserves his lower position. His
rivals are of older lineage. The reason for his inferior posi
tion is, practically, that he has little to do with man. Being
already created, man takes more interest in the gods that pre
serve and destroy.^ Even Brahma's old exploits are, as we have shown, stolen from him and given over to Vishnu. The
famous (totemistic) tortoise legend was originally Brahma's, and
so with others of the ten ' forms ' of Vishnu, for instance the boar-shape, in which Vishnu manifests himself, and the fish
shape of Brahma (epic) in the flood-story. The formal tri
mUrti or traipurusha (' three persons ') is a late figure. It would seem that a Harihara (Vishnu and Qiva as one) preceded the trinity, though the dual name is not found till quite
late.^ But, as we showed above, the epic practically identifies
Vishnu and Qliva as equals, before it unites with these Brahma
as an equal third. There arises now the further question whether sectarian Vishnuism be the foisting of Krishnaism upon a dummy Vishnu. We think that, stated in this way, such scarcely can have been the case. Neither of the great sects is professedly
of priestly origin, but each, like other sects, claims Vedic

authority, and finds Brahman ical support. We have said that Vishnu is raised to his position without ictic suddenness. He
is always a god of mystic claaracter, in short, a god for philosophy to work upon. He is recognized as the highest god in one of the oldest Upanishads. And' it is with the philosopher's Vishnu that Krishna is identified. Krishna, the real Vasudeva
(for a false Vasudeva is known also in the epic), is the god of a
local cult. How did he originate? The king of serpents is
called Krishna, ' the black,' and Vishnu reposes upon Qesha Ananta, the world-snake ; but a more historical character than this can be claimed for Krishna. This god-man must be the same with the character mentioned in the Chandogya Upani
shad, 3. 17. 6. One may notice the similarities between this Krishna and him of the epic cult. Krishna, son of Devaki, was taught by his teacher, Ghora Angirasa, that sacrifice may be performed without objective means ; that generosity, kindness, and
other moral traits are the real signs of sacrifice ; and it is then said : " The priest Ghora Angirasa having said this to Krishna,
the son of DeVaki — and the latter was thereby freed from
(thirst) desire — said : " When a man is about to die let him
resort to this triad : ' the imperishable art thou,' ' the unmoved
art thou,' 'breath's firmness art thou' ; in regard to which are
these two verses in the Rig-Veda ; ^ ' till they see the light of
the old seed which is kindled in the sky,' and 'perceiving above the darkness the higher light, the sun, god among gods, we come to the highest light.' " Krishna thus learned the
abolition of sacrifice, and the worship of the sun, the highest
light (Vishnu), as true being — for this is the meaning of the philosophical passage taken with its context. Kings and
1 RV. viii. 6. 30; i. 50. 10. Weber refers Krishna further back to a priestly Vedic poet of that name, to whom are attributed hymns of the eighth and tenth books of the Rig Veda {Janmdstamt, p. 316). He interprets Krishna's mother's name, Devaki, as 'player' {il?.). But the chance of name in a Vedic hymn has no special significance. The name Devaki is found applied to other persons, and its etymology is rather deva, divine, as Weber now admits (Berl. Ak. 1890, p. 931).



466 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
priests discuss philosophy together in this period/ and it would conform to later tradition to see in the pupil the son of
a king. It is, moreover, significant that the priest, Ghora
Angirasa, is named specially as priest of the sun-god elsewhere
(Kaush. Br. 30. 6), as well as that Krishna Angirasa is also the
name of a teacher. It is said in this same Upanishad (3. i. i)
that the sun is the honey, delight, of the gods ; and this chapter is a meditation on the sun,'' of which the dark (krsnd) form is that which comes from the Itihasas and Puranas, the
fore-runners of the epic (3. 4. 3). This is taught as a brahma
icpanishad, a teaching of the absolute, and it is interesting to see that it is handed down through Brahma, Prajapati, and Manu, exactly as Krishna says in the Divine Song that his own doctrine has been promulgated ; while (it is said further)
for him that knows the doctrine ' there is day,' his sun never
sets (3. II. 3-4). It is a doctrine to be communicated only to the eldest son or a good student, and to no one else. (ib. 5), i.e., it was new, esoteric, and of vital importance. Here, too, one finds Sanatkuraara, the 'ever young,' as Skanda,^ yet as an
earthly student also (7. i ; 26. 2), just like Krishna. It cannot be 'imagined, however, that the cult of the Gangetic Krishna originated with that vague personage whose pupilage is described in the Upanishad. But this account may still be connected with the epic Krishna. The epic describes the overthrow of an old Brahmanic Aryan race at the hands of the Pandavas, an unknown folk, whose king's
1 In the epic, also, kings become hermits, and perform great penance just as do the ascetic priests. Compare the heroes themselves, and i. 42. 23 raja mahatapds; also ii. 19, where a king renounces his throne, and with his two wives becomes a hermit in the woods. In i. 41. 31 a king is said to be equal to ten priests
!
2 In fact, the daily repetition of the SavitrT is a tacit admission of the sun-god as the highest type of the divine ; and Vishnu is the most spiritualized form of the sungod, representing even in the Rig-Veda the goal of the departing spirit. 8 Skanda (Subrahmanya) and Gane^a are (^iva's two sons, corresponding to Krishna and Rama. Skanda's own son is Vi^akha, ^ graha (above, p. 415).



HISTORY OF THE HINDU TRINITY. 467
polyandrous marriage (his wife is the spouse of his four
brothers as well as of himself) is an historical trait, connecting
the tribe closely with the polyandrous wild tribes located north of the Ganges. This tribe attacked the stronghold of Brahmanism in the holy land about the present Delhi ; and their patron god is the Gangetic Krishna. In the course of the
narrative a very few tales are told of Krishna's early life, but
the? simple original view of Krishna is that he is a god, the son of Devaki. The few other tales are late and adventitious
additions, but this is a consistent trait. Modern writers are
fain to see in the antithesis presented by the god Krishna and by the human hero Krishna, late and* early phases. They for
get that the lower side of Krishna is one especially Puranic. In short, they read history backwards, for theirs is not the Indie way of dealing with gods. In Krishna's case the tricky,
vulgar, human side is a later aspect, which comes to light most prominently in the Genealogy of Vishnu and in the Vishnu Purana, modern works which in this regard contrast strongly with the older epic, where Krishna, however he tricks, is always first the god. It is not till he becomes a very great, if not the greatest, god that tales about his youthful performances, when he condescended to be born in low life, begin to rise. An exact parallel may be seen in the case of Qiva, who
at first is a divine character, assuming a more or less grotesque likeness to a man ; but subsequently he becomes anthropomorphized, and is fitted out with a sheaf of legends which describe
his earthly acts.^ And so with Krishna. As the chief god,
identified with the All-god, he is later made the object of encomiums which degrade while they are meant to exalt him. He becomes a cow-boy and acts like one, a god in a mask. But in
1 Qiva at the present day, for instance, is represented now and then as a man, and he is incarnate as Virabhadra. But all this is modern, and contrasts with the older conception. It is only in recent times, in the South, that he is provided with an earthly history. Compare Williams, Thought and Life^ p. 47.

the epic he is the invading tribe's chief god, in process of
becoming identified with that god in the Brahmanic pantheon
wlio .most resembles him. For this tribe, the (Yadavas) Pan
davas, succeeded in overthrowing the Brahmanic stronghold and became absorbed into the Brahmanic circle. Their god, who, like most of the supreme gods of this region among the wild tribes, was the tribal hero as sun-god, became recognized by the priests as one with Vishnu. In the Upanishad the priestphilosopher identifies Krishna with the sun as the ' dark side
'
(krsna, ' dark ') of Vishnu, the native name probably being near enough to the Sanskrit word to be represented by it. The statement that this clan-god Krishna once learned the great
truth that the sun is the All-god, at the mouth of a Brahman, is what might be expected. ' Krishna, the son of Devaki,' is not only the god, but he is; also the progenitor of the clan, the
mystic forefather, who as usual is deified as the sun. To the priest he is merely an avatar of Vishnu. The identity of Krishna with the Gangetic god described by Megasthenes can scarcely be disputed. The latter as represented by the Greek is too great a god to have passed away without a sign except
for a foreigner's account. And there is no figure like his ex
cept that of Krishna. The numerous avatars ' of Vishnu are first given as ten, then as twenty, then as twenty-two,^ and at last become innumerable. The ten, which are those usually referred to, are as fol
lows : First come the oldest, the \it2iiXravatars, viz., as a fish ;
as a tortoise \^ as a boar (rescuing earth from a flood) ; and as a man-lion (slaying a demon). Next comes the dwarfavatar, where Vishnu cheats Bali of earth by asking, as a dwarf, for three steps of it, and then stepping out over all of it

(the ' three strides ' of the Rig Veda). Then come the human avatars, that of Para§u-Rama (Rama with the axe), Krishna, Rama ^ (hero of the Ramayana epic), Buddha, and Kalki (who
is still to come).
The parallels between the latest Krishna cult and the Biblical narrative are found only in the Puranas and other late works, and undoubtedly, as we have said in the last chapter, are borrowed from Christian sources. Krishna is here born in a
stable, his father, like Joseph, going with his virgin spouse to
pay taxes. His restoring of a believing woman's son is narrated only in the modern Jaimini Bharata. These tales might have been received through the first distant Christian mission
in the South in the sixth century, but it is more likely that they were brought directly to the North in the seventh century ; for at that time a Northern king of the Vai9ya caste, Qil^ditya (in whose reign the Chinese pilgrim, Hiouen Thsang, visited India), made Syrian Christians welcome to his court (639 a.d.).^ The,
date of the annual Krishna festival, which is a reflex of Christ
mastide, is variously fixed by the Puranas as coming in July or August.^ As Krishna is an avatar of Vishnu * in the Bharata, and as the axe-Rama is another avatar in legend (here Vishnu in the
form of Para^u-Rama raises up the priestly caste, and destroys the warrior-caste), so in the Ramayana the hero Rama (not Paragu-Rama) is made an avatar of Vishnu. He is a mythical prince of Oude (hence a closfe connection between the Rama
1 Balarama (or Baladeva), Krishna's elder brother, is to be distinguished from Rama. The former is a late addition to the Krishna-cult, and belongs with Nanda, his reputed father. Like Krishna, the name is also that of a snake, Naga, and it is not impossible that Naga worship may be the foundation of the Krishna-cult, but it would be hard to reconcile this with tradition. In the sixth century Varahamihira recognizes both the brothers. 2 Edkins, cited by Miiller, India, p. 286. 3 Weber, Janmastami, pp. 259, 318. Weber describes in full the cult of the " Madonna with the Child," according to the Puranas. 1 On the subsequent deification of the Pandas themselves see lA. vii. 127.

yana and Buddhism), who is identified with Vishnu. Vishnu wished to rid eartli of the giant Ravana,-' and to do so took the form of Rama. As Krishnaism has given rise to a number of sects that worship Krishna as Vishnu, so Ramaism is the modern cult of Rama as Vishnu. Both of these sects oppose the
Vishnuite that is not inclined to be sectarian ; all three oppose
the ^ivaite ; and all four of these oppose the orthodox Brahman, who assigns supreme godship to Qiva or Vishnu as little as does the devotee of these gods in unsectarian form to Krishna or Rama. Qiva is on all sides opposed to Vishnu. The Greek account of the third century B.C. says that he taught the Hindus to dance the kordax, but at this time there appears to have been no such phallic worship in his honor as is recorded in the pseudo-epic, ^iva is known in early Brahmanic and in Buddhistic writings, and even as the bearer-of-the-moon, Candragekhara, he contrasts with Vishnu, as his lightning-form and mountain-habitat differ from the sun-form and valley-home of
his rival. This dire god is conceived of as ascetic partly because he is gruesome, partly because he is magical in power. Hence he is the true type of the awful magical Yogi, and as such appealed to the Brahman. Originally he is only a fearful
magical god, great, and even all-pervading, but, as seen in the Brahmanic Qatarudriya hymn, he is at first in no sense a pan
theistic deity. In this hymn there is a significant addition made to the earlier version. In the first form of the hymn it
is said that Rudra, who is here (^vv2., is the god of bucolic people ; but the new version adds ' and of all people.' Here
Qiva appears as a wild, diabolical figure, ' the god of incanta
tions,' whose dart is death ; and half of the hymn is taken up with entreaties to the god to spare the speaker. He is praised, in conjunction with trees, of which he is the lord, as

the one 'clad in skins,' the 'lord of cattle,' the 'lord of paths,'
the ' cheater,' the ' deceiver.' When he is next clearly seen, in
the epic, he is the gcd to whom are offered human sacrifices,
and his special claim to worship is the phallus ; while the inter
mediate literature shows glimpses of him only in his simple Brahmanic forta of terror. It has long been known that ^ivaite phallic worship was not borrowed from the Southerners, as was once imagined, and we venture with some scholars to believe that it was due rather to late Greek influence than to that
of any native wild tribe.^
1 Greek influence is clearly reflected in India's architecture. Hellenic bas-reliefs representing Bacchic scenes and the love-god are occasionally found. Compare the description of Qiva's temple in Orissa, Weber, Literature^ p. 36S; BerL Ak., 1890, p. 912. (Jiva is here associated with the Greek cult of Eros and Aphrodite.



CHAPTER XVII.
MODERN HINDU SECTS. i
Although the faith of India seems to have completed a circle, landing at last in a polytheism as gross as was that of the
Vedic age, yet is this a delusive aspect, as will appear if one
survey the course of the higher intellectual life of the people,
ignoring, as is right, the invariable factor introduced by the
base imaginings of the vulgar. The greater spirituality has always expressed itself in independent movement, and voiced itself in terms of revolution. But in reality each change has
been one of evolution. To trace back to the Vedic period the origin of Hindu sectarianism would, indeed, be a nice task for a fine scholar, but it would not be temerarious to attempt it. We have failed of our purpose if we have not already impressed upon the reader's mind the truth that the progress of Brahmanic theology (in distinction from demonology) has been one jour
ney, made with rests and halts, it is true, and even with digres^ sions from the straight path ; but without abatement of intent, and without permanent change of direction. Nor can one judge otherwise even when he stands before so humiliating an exhibition of groundling bigotry as is presented by some of the religious sects of the present day. The world of lower organisms survives the ascent of the higher. There is always undergrowth ; but before the fall of a great tree its seeds sprout, withal in the very soil of the weedy thicket below. So out of
1 In the following we keep to the practice we have adopted in the early part of the work, giving anglicized words without distinction of vowel-length, and anglicizing as far as possible, writing thus Sankhya but Sankhyan, Vedanta but Vedantist. In modern proper names we have adopted in each case the most familiar form.

the rank garden of Hindu superstitions arise, one after another, lofty trees of an old seed, which is ever renewed, and which cultivation has gradually improved. We have shown, especially in the chapters on the Atharva Veda and on Hinduism, as revealed in epic poetry, how constant in India is the relation between these two growths. If
surprised at the height of early Hindu thought, one is yet more
astonished at the permanence of the inferior life which flourishes
beneath the shady protection of the superior. Even here one may follow the metaphor, for the humbler life below is often a condition of the grander growth above. In the Rig Veda there is an hymn of faith and doubt
To Indra.i
He who, just born, with thought endowed, the foremost, Himself a god hemmed in the gods with power ; Before whose breath, and at whose manhood's greatness, The two worlds trembled ; he, ye folk, is Indra.
He who the earth made firm as it was shaking. And made repose the forward tottering mountains ; Who measured wide the inter-ppace aerial. And heaven established ; he, ye folk, is Indra.

These are not pleas in behalf of a new god. It is not the mere god of physical phenomena who is here doubted and
defended. It is the god that in the last stage of the Rig Vfeda
is become the Creator and Destroyer, and, in the light of a
completed pantheism, is grown too great to retain his person
ality. With such a 'protest begins the great revolt that is the sign of an inner evolution extending through the Brahmanas and
Upanishads. Indra, like other gods,-' is held by the rite ; to
the vulgar he is still the great god ;
'' to the philosopher, a name. The populace respect him, and sacerdotalism conserves him,
that same crafty, priestly power, which already at the close of the Rig Vedic period dares to say that only the king who is
subject to the priest is sure of' himself, and a little later that killing a priest is the only real murder. We have shown above how the real divinity of the gods was diminished even at the
hands of the priests that needed them for the rites and baksheesh, which was the goal of their piety. Even Prajapati,
the Father-god, their own creation, is mortal as well as immortal.^ We have shown, also, how difficult it must have been to release the reason from the formal band of the rite. Socially it was
impossible to do so. He that was not initiated was excommu
nicated, an outcast. But, on the other hand, the great sacri
fices gradually fell over from their own weight. Cumbersome and costly, they were replaced by proxy works of piety ; vidhdnas were established that obviated the real rite ; just as to-day, ' pocket altars ' take the place of real altars.* There was a
gradual intrusion of the Hindu cult ; popular features began to obtain ; the sacrifice was made to embrace in its workings the

whole family of the sacrificer (instead of its effect being con
fined to him alone, as was the earlier form) ; and finally village celebrations became more general than those of the individual. Slowly Hinduism built itself a ritual/ which overpowered the Brahmanic rite. Then, again, behind the geographical advance of Brahmanism ^ lay a people more and mbre prone to diverge from the true cult (from the Brahmanic point of view). In the latter part of the great Brahmana^ there is already a distrust of the Indus tribes, which marks the breaking up of Aryan
unity ; not that breaking up into political division which is seen even in the Rig Veda, where Aryan fights against Aryan as well as against the barbarian, but the more serious dismemberment caused by the hates of priests, for here there was no
reconciliation.
The cynical scepticism of the Brahmanic ritualists, as well as
the divergence of opinions in regard to this or that sacrificial
pettiness, shows that even where there was overt union there was
covert discord, the disagreement of schools, and the difference
of faith. But all this does but reflect the greater difference in speculation and theology which was forming above the heads of
the ritualistic bigots. For it is not without reason that the
Upanishads are more or less awkwardly laid in as the top-stone
on the liturgical edifice. They belong to the time but they are
of it only in part. Yet to dissociate the mass of Brahmanic
priestlings from the Upanishad thinkers, as if the latter were altogether members of a new era, would be to lose the true his
torical perspective. The vigor of protest against the received belief continues from the Rig Veda to Buddha, from Buddha
till to-day. The Vedic cult absorbed a good deal of Hinduism, for in

Stance the worship of Fate/ just as Hinduism absorbed a good deal of Vedic cult. Nor were the popular works obnoxious to the priest. In the Chandogya Upanishad ^ the Itihasas and
Puranas (fore-runnets of the epic) are already reckoned as a fifth Veda, being recognized as a Veda almost as soon as was the Atharvan,^ which even in Manu is still called merely ' texts of Atharvan and Angiras ' (where texts of Bhrigu might as well have been added). Just as the latter work is formally recognized, and the use of its magical formulas, if employed for a good purpose, is enjoined in epic * and law {e.g., Manu, xi. 33), so the Hinduistic rites crept gradually into the foreground, pushing back the soma-c\s\X.. Idols are formally recognized as venerable by the law-makers ; ^ even before their day the ' holy pool,' which we have shown to be so important to Hinduism, is accepted by Brahmanism." Something, too, of the former's
catholicity is apparent in the cult at an early date, only to be
suppressed afterwards. Thus in Ait. Br. ii. ig, the slave's son
shares the sacrifice ; and the slave drinks soma in one of the half-Brahmanical, half-popular festivals.' Whether human sacrifice, sanctioned by some modern sects, is aught but pUre
Hinduism, Qivaism, as affected by the cult of the wild-tribes,
it is hard to say. At any rate, such sacrifices in the Brahmanic world were obsolete long before one finds them in Hinduism. Of Buddhistic, Brahmanic, and Hinduistic reciprocity

478 THE RELIGIOjYS OF lATD/A.
we have spoken already, but we may add one curious fact, namely, that the Buddhism of Qivaism is marked by its holy numbers. The Brahmanic Rudra with eight names ' and eight forms ^ is clearly Qivaite, and the numbers are as clearly Buddhistic.^ Thus, as Feer has shown, Buddhist hells are eight, sixteen, etc., while the Brahmanic hells are seven, twenty-one,
etc. Again, the use of the rosary was originally Qivaite, not Buddhistic ; ^ and Buddha in Bali, where they live amicably
side by side, is regarded as Civa's brother.^
Two things result from this interlocking of 'sectarian Brahmanism with other sects. First, it is impossible to say in how
far each influenced the other ; and, again, the antiquity of special ideas is rendered doubtful. A Brahmanic idea can
pretty safely be allotted to its first period, because the literature is large enough to permit the assumption that it will appear
in literature not much later than it Obtains. But a sectarian idea may go back centuries before it is permanently formu
lated, as, for example, the doctrine of special grace in a modern
sect. One more point must be noticed before we proceed to review
the sects of to-day. Hindu morality, the ethical tone of the mod
ern sects, is older than the special forms of Hindu viciousness which have been received into the cult. A negative altruism (beyond which Brahmanism never got) is characteristic of the

Br. vi. 1, 3 The Brahmanic multiple by preference is (three and) seven (7, 21, 28, 35), that of the Buddhist, eight. , Feer, J A., 1893, p. ii3ff., holds the Svargaparva of the epic to be Buddhistic on account of the hells. More probably it is a C^ivaite addition. The rule does not always hold good, for groups of seven and eight are sometimes Buddhistic and Brahmanic, respectively. ^ Leumann, Rosaries. 5 Friederich, JRAS. viii. 157 ; ix. 59. The only established reference to Buddha on the part of Brahmanism, with the exception of late Puranas of uncertain date, is after Kshemendra ("1066 A.D.). Compare Holtzmann, z. Geschichie, p. 103.

Hindu sects. But this is already embodied in tlie golden rule, as it is thus formulated in the epic ' Compendium of Duty '
:
Not .that to others should one do Which he himself objecteth to. This is man's duty in one word ; All other rules may be ignored.^
The same is true of the ' Ten Commandments ' of one of the modern sects. It is one of the strong proofs that Christian morals did not have much effect upon early Hinduism, that, although the Christian Church of St. Thomas, as is well estab
lished, was in Malabar as early as 522,^ and Christians were in
the North in the seventh century, yet no trace of the active Christian benevolence, in place of this abstention from injury,
finds its way into the epic or Puranas. But an active altruism permeates Buddhism, and one reads in the birth-stories even of a saviour Buddha, not the Buddha of love, Maitreya, who was to be the next Buddha on earth, but of that Maitrakanyaka, who left heaven and came to earth that he might redeem the sins of
others.^
Whether there is any special touch between the older sects and those of modern days * that have their headquarters in the
1 Na tat parasya sandadhydt pratikulani yad dtmanas. This is a favorite stanza in the epic, and is imitated in later literature (Spriiche, 3253, 6578, 6593). 2 Burnell in the Indian Antiqttary, second and following volumes ; Swanston, JRAS. 1834; 1835; Germa.nn, Die JCirc/ie der Thomaschristen. 3 Above, cited from Hardy. 4 Some of the multitudinous sub-castes occasionally focus about a religious princi. pie to such an extent as to give them almost the appearance of religious devotees. Thus the Bhats and Charans are heralds and bards with the mixed faith of so many low-caste Hindus. But in their office of herald they have a religious pride, and, since in the present day they are less heralds than expressmen, they carry property with religious reverence, and are respected in their office even by robbers ; for it is this caste that do not hesitate to commit traga, that is, if an agreement which they have caused to be made between two parties is not carried out they will kill themselves and their families, with such religious effect that the guilt lies upon the offending party in the agreement, who expiates it by his own life. They are regarded as a sort of divine representative, and feci themselves to be so. A case reported from India in this year,

same districts is a question which we have endeavored to investigate, but we have found nothing to substantiate such an opinion. Buddhism retired too early to have influence on the sects of to-day, and between Jainism and the same sects there does not seem to be any pecuHar rapport even where the sect
is seated in a Jain stronghold.^ The Jains occupy, generally speaking, the Northwest (and South), while the Buddhists were located in the Northeast and South. So Qivaism may be loosely located as popular in the Northeast and South, while Vishnuism has its habitat rather in the Jain centres of the Northwest (and South). We have mentioned in the preceding chapter the sects of a few centuries ago, as these have been described in Brahmanic literature.'' The importance, and even the existence of some of the sects, described in the Conquest of Qankara, has been questioned, and the opinion has been expressed that, since they are described only to be exposed as heretical, they may have been creations of fancy, imaginary sects ; the refutation of their
principles being a tour de force on the part of the Brahmanic savant, who shows his acumen by imagining a sect and then discountenancing it. It does not, indeed, seem to us very probable that communities were ever formed as ' Agnis ' or ' Yamas,' etc., but on the other hand, we think it is more likely that sects have gone to pieces without leaving any trace than that those enumerated, explained, and criticised should have been mere fancies.^ Moreover, in the case of some of these sects
1894, shows that the feeUng still exists. The herald slew his own mother in the presence of the defaulting debtor, who thereupon slew himself as his only expiation. 1 As, for example, between the Dadu Panthls and the Jains in Ajmir and Jeypur. The last was a chief Digambara town, while Mathura (on the Jumna) was a (^vetambara station. For a possible survival of Buddhism, see below, p. 485, note. 2 The Sarvadar^anasahgraha of Sayana (fourteenth century) and the (Qankaravijaya^ or ' Conquest of (Qankara.' 8 Thus the Dabistan enumerates as actual sects of -the seventeenth century, 'moonworshippers,' ' star-worshippers,' * Agni-worshippers,' ' wind-worshippers,' * water-worshippers,' ' earth-worshippers,' ' tripftjas ' (or worshippers of all the three kingdoms

there are still survivors, so that a fortiori one may presume the others to have existed also, if not as sects or communities, yet
as bodies professing faith in Indra or Yama, etc. The sects
with which we have to deal now are chiefly those of this cen
tury, but many of these can claim a definite antiquity of several centuries at least. They have been described by Wilson
in his famous Sketch, and, in special cases, more recently and more fully by Williams ' and other writers.
THE giVAITES.
While the Vishnuites have a dualistic, as well as idealistic background, they are at present Vedantic, and may be divided to-day simply into intelligent and unintelUgent adherents of pantheism, the former comprising the Rama sects, and the latter most of the Krishnaites. On the other hand, in ^ivaism one must distinguish quite sharply in time between the differ
ent sects that go by Qiva's name. If one look at the sects of modern times he will find that the most degraded are dualistic, in so far as they may be said to have any philosophy, and that
idealistic Qivaism is a remnant of the past. But he will not find a pronounced sectarianism in any of these old Vedantic aspects of Qivaism. On the contrary, wherever Qivaism is pantheistic it is a ^ivaism which obtains only in certain ancient schools of philosophy; where it is monotheistic it is among leaders who have been influenced by the modern teaching of Islam, and regard Qiva merely as a name for the One God. ; It is neces
sary, therefore, as it is everywhere in India, to draw as sharp
a line as possible between the beliefs of the vulgar and the
learned. For from the earliest period the former accepted
of nature), and ' worshippers of man ' [mamtsyabhaktds) , "who recognize the being of God in man, and Icnow nothing more perfect than mankind " (ii. 12), a faith which, as we have shown, is professed in the Mahabharata. 1 Religious Thoitght and Life,



482 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
perfunctorily the teaching of the latter, but at heart and in
cult they remained true to their own lights. The older Sankhya form of Qivaism was still found among the Pagupatas, ' adherents of the Lord ' (Pa^upati) and Mahe^varas (' adherents of the great Lord '), who are mentioned in the epic
and in inscriptions of the fifth century. In the ninth century
there was a purely philosophical Qivaism which is Vedantic.
But neither in the fact (which is by no means a certainty) that Qankara accepted Qiva as the name of the All-god, nor in the scholastic Qivaite philosophy of Kashmeer, which in the next two centuries was developed into a purely idealistic system at the hands of Abhinavagupta and Somananda, is there any trace of a popular religion. Qiva is here the pantheistic god, but he is conceived as such only by a coterie of retired schoolmen. On the other hand, the popular religions which spring up in the
twelfth century are, if Vedantic, chiefly Vishnuite, or, if Qivaite, only nominally Vedantic. Thus what philosophy the Jangamas professedly have is Vedantic, but in fact they are
deistic (not pantheistic) disciples of Qiva's priest, Basava (Sanskrit Vrishabha), who taught Qiva-worship in its grossest form, the adoration of the Linga (phallus) ; while his adherents, who are spread over all India under the name of Jangamas,
' vagrants,' or Lingayits, ' phallus-wearers,' are idolatrous deists with but a tinge of Vedantic mysticism. So in the case of the Tridandins, the Da5anamis, and other sects attributed to ^ivaism, as well as the Smartas (orthodox Brahmans) who professed Qivaism. According to Wilson the Tridandis (whose triple, tri, staff, dandi, indicates control of word, thought, and deed) are Southern Vishnuites of the Raman uj a sect, though some of them claim to be Vedantic Qivaites. Nominally Qivaite are
also the Southern ' Saints,' Sittars (Sanskrit Siddhas), but these are a modern sect whose religion has been taught them by Islam, or possibly by Christianity.^ The extreme North and
1 The Kashmeer (Jivaites claim (Jankara as their teacher. The sect of Basava



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 483
South are the districts where Qivaism as a popular religion has,
or had, its firmest hold, and it is for this reason that the higher
religions which obtain in these districts are given to Qiva. But
in reality they simply take ^i^^i the great god of the neighborhood, in order to have a name for their monotheistic god,,
exactly as missionaries among the American Indians pray to the Great Spirit, to adapt themselves to their audience's comprehension. In India, as in this country, they that proselyte would prefer to use their own terminology, but they wisely use
that of their hearers.
We find no evidence to prove that there were ever really sectarian Qivaites who did not from the beginning practice brutal
rites, or else soon become ascetics of the lowest and most des
picable sort. For iphilosophical Qivaites were never sectaries.X They cared litfle whether the All-god or One they argued about was called Vishnu or Qiva. But whenever one finds a true Qivaite devotee, that is, a man that will not worsTiip Vishnu but holds fast to Qiva as the only manifestation of the supreme divinity, he will notice that such an one quickly becomes obscene,
brutal, prone to bloodshed, apt for any disgustirig practice, in
tellectually void, and morally beneath contempt. If the Qivaite
be an ascetic his asceticism will be the result either of his lack
of intelligence (as in the case of the sects to be described immediately) or of his cunning, for he knows that there are plenty of people who will save him the trouble of earning a living. Now this is not the case with the Vishnuites. To be sure there
are Vishnuites that are no better than Qivaites, but there are also strict Vishnuites, exclusively devotees of Vishnu, who are and remain pure, not brutal, haters of bloodshed, apt for no disgusting practices, intellectually admirable, and morally above
reproach. In other words, there are to-day great numbers of
started in the south, Mysore. They have some trashy literature (legends, etc.) which they dignify by the name of Puranas. Btihier has given an account of the Kashmeer school. For further details see Earth, pp. 184, 206.



4S4 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Vishnuites who continue to be really Vishnuites, and yet are really intelligent and moral. This has never been the case with real Qivaites. Again, as Williams -^ has pointed out, Qivaism is a cheap religion ; Krishnaism is costly. The Qivaite needs for his cult only a phallus pebble, bilva leaves and water. The Krishnaite is expected to pay heavily for leitourgiai. But Qivaism is cheap because Qivaites are poor, the dregs of society ; it is not adopted because it is cheap.
We think, therefore, that to describe Qivaism as indifferently
pantheistic or dualistic, and to argue that it must have been
pantheistic a few centuries after the Christian era because Qiva at that time in scholastic philosophy and among certain intellectual sects was regarded as the ona god, tends to obscure the
historical relation of the sects. Without further argumentation on this point, we shall explain what in our view* is necessary to
a true understanding of the mutual relations between ^ivaites and Vishnuites in the past.
Monotheism ^ and pantheism are respectively the religious expression of the Sankhya and Vedanta systems of philosophy, ^ivaism, Krishnaism, and Ramaism are all originally deistic.
I'ure ^ivaism has remained so to this day^ not only in all its popular sectarian expressions, but also in the Brahmanic Qiva
ism of the early epic, and in the Qivaism which expresses itself
in the adoration-formulae of the literature of the Renaissance. But there is a pseudo-^ivaism which starts up from the ninth
to the twelfth centuries, and tries to work Qiva's name into a
1 Brahmanism and Hinduism^ p, 62 ff. To this and to the same author's Thought and Life, we are indebted for many facts concerning the sects as they appear to-day, though much in these books is said after Wilson or other scholars, whose work is now common property, and calls for no further acknowledgment. 2 It is, perhaps, necessary to keep repeating that Hindu monotheism does not exclude other gods which, at the hands of the one god, are reduced to sprites, angels, demons, etc. But it ought not to be necessary to insist on this, for an American monotheist that believes in angels and devils is the same sort of monotheist. The Hindu calls the angels ' gods ' or ' divinities,' but they are only attendant hosts of the One.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 485
pantheistic system of philosophy. Every such attempt, however, and all of them are the reflex of the growing importance
of Vedantic ideas, fails as such to produce a religion. If the
movement becomes popular and develops into a religious system for the masses, it at once gives up ^iva and takes up Vishnu, or, keeping Qiva, it drops pantheism and becomes a
low form of sectarian ascetism. ^ivaism is, therefore, fundamentally non-Vedantic, and Unitarian.' On the other hand, while Krishnaism and Ramaism begin'
as deistic (tribal) cults, they are soon absorbed into Brahtnanic Vishnuism. Now Vishnuism is essentially Brahmanistic, and the only orthodox (Brahmanic) system is that which holds to the completion of Vedic pantheism. The first systematic philosophy, however, was not orthodox. It was the Sankhya, which peeps out in the dualism of the oldest distinctly philosophical works, and lingers in the Puranic Sankhya. The marks of this dualism we have shown in the Divine Song of the eipic. It is by means of it that Krishnaism as an expression of this heterodox Vishnuism became possible. Vishnuism was soon rescued from the dualists, and became again what it was originally, an expression of pantheism. But Vishnu car
ried Krishna with him as his alter ego, and in the epic the two are finally one All-god. Vedantic philosophy continued to
present Vishnu rather than Qiva as its All-god, until to-day Vishnuism is the sectarian aspect of the Vedanta system. But with Vishnu have risen Krishna and Rama as still further
types of the All-god. Thus it is that Vishnuism, whether as
Krishnaism or as Ramaism, is to-day a pantheistic religion.
But, while Rama is the god of the philosophical sects,
1 Some of the (^ivaite sects are, indeed, Buddhistic in origin, a fact which raises the question whether Buddhism, instead of disappearing from India, was not simply absorlred ; much as Unitarianism in New England has spent its vitality in modifying the orthodox creed. Thus the karma of Buddhism may still be working in the person of some modern Hindu sects. See the next npte below.



486 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
and, therefore, is almost entirely a pantheistic god ; Krishna, who was always a plebeian, is continually reverting, ' so to
speak, to himself ; that is to say, he is more affected by the
vulgar, and as the vulgar are more prone, by whatever sectarian name they call themselves, to worship one idol, it hap
pens that Krishna in the eyes of his following is less of a pantheistic god than is Rama. Here again, therefore, it is necessary to draw the line not so much between names of sects \^as between intelligent and unintelligent people. For Krishnaism, despite all that has been done for Krishna by the philosophers ' of his church, in this regard resembles Qivaism, that it repre
sents the religion of unintelligent (though wealthy) classes, who revere Krishna as their one pet god, without much more thought of his being an All-god avatar than is spent by the ordinary Qivaite on the purely nominal trinitarianism which
J has been foisted upon ^iva. But we must now give an account of' the low sectaries, the miracle-mongers, jugglers,^ and ascetic whimsicalities, which together stand under the phallic standard of Qivaism. Ancient and recent observers enumerate a sad list of them. The devotees of the ' highest bird ' are a low set of ascetics, who
live on voluntary alms, the result of their affectation of extreme penance. The Urdhvabahus, ' Up-arms,' raise their , arms till they are unable to lower them again. The Akaga
; mukhas, ' Sky-facers,' hold their faces toward the sky till the muscles stiffen, and they live thus always. The Nakhis, ' Nail
'
1 Most of the Yogi jugglers are ^ivaites (when they are not Buddhistic), and today they share with the (Mohammedan) falcirs tlie honor of being not only ascetics but knaves. The juggler Yogi is, however, a. figure of respectable antiquity. The magical tricks practiced on tlie epic heroes are doubtless a reflex of tlie current mesmerism, which deceives so cleverly to-day. We have sliown above a Buddhistic strain of Mahatmaism in an early Buddhistic tract, and Barth, p. 213, suggests a Buddhistic origin for the Kitnaphats. See also Holtzmann, loc. cit. The deistic Yogis of Gorakhnath's sect are respectable enough (see an account of some of this sort in the Dabistan, ii. 6), but they are of Buddhistic origin. Tlie Kanaphats of Kutch (Danodhar) were once a celibate brotherhood. JRAS. 1839, p. 268.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 487
ascetics, allow their nails to grow through their clenched hands,
which unfits them for work (but they are all too religiously lazy to work), and makes it necessary for the credulous faithful to support them. Some of these, like the Kanaphats, ' Ear
splitters,' who pierce the ear with heavy rings, have been respectable Yogis in the past, but most of them have lost what sense their philosophic founders attached to the sign, and keep only the latter as their religion. Some, such as the Ukharas
and Sukharas, appear to have no distinctive features, all of them being the 'refuse of beggars' (Wilson). Others claim virtue on the strength of nudity, and subdue their passions literally with lock and key. The 'Potmen,' the 'Skull-men,' Gtidaras and Kapalikas, are distinguished, as their names imply, only by their vessels. The former, however, are the remnant of a once thoughtful sect known by name since the sixth century, and Kanaphats and Kapalikas both show that very likely others among / these wretches are but the residue of ancient Qivaite sects, who began as philosophers (perhaps Buddhists), and became only ascetic and thus degraded ; for, Qiva apparently has no power to make his worshippers better than himself, and he is a dirty monster, now and then galvanized into the resemblance of a decent god. There is a well-known verse, not in Manu, but attributed to him (and for that reason quite a modern forgery),^ which de
clares that ^ambhu (Qiva) is the god of priests ; Vishnu, the god of warriors ; Brahma, the god of the Vaigyas (farmers and
traders) ; and Ganega, the god of slaves. It is, on the contrary, Qliva himself, not his son Ganega, who is the ' god of low
people ' in the early literature. It is he who ' destroys sacri
fice,' and is anything but a god of priests till he is carefully made over by the latter. Nowadays some Brahmans profess
the Qivaite faith, but they are Vishnuite if really sectarian.'
1 See JAOS. xi. 272. To ascribe this verse to the ' older Manu ' would be a grave slip on the part of a Sanskrit scholar.



488 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
No Brahman, for instance, will serve at a Qiva shrine, except possibly at Benares, where among more than an hundred shrines to Qiva and his family, Vishnu has but one ; and though he will occasionally perform service even in a heretic Jain temple he will not lower himself to worship the Linga.
Nor is it true that Qiva is a patron of literature. Like Ganega, his son, Qiva may upset everything if he be not properly placated, and consequently there is, at the beginning of every
enterprise (among others, literary enterprises) in the Renais
sance literature, but never in the works of religion or law or in any but modern profane literature, an invocation to Qiva. But he is no more a patron of literature than is Gane^a, or in other words, Qivaism is not more literary than is Ganegaism.
In a literary country no religion is so illiterate as Qivaism, no
writings are so inane as are those in his honor. There is no poem, no religious literary monument, no Purana even, dedicated
to Qiva, that has any literary merit. All that is readable in
sectarian literature, the best Puranas, the Divine Song, the sectarian Ramayana, come from Vishnuism. Qivaism has nothing to compare with this, except in the works of them
that pretend to be Qivaites but are really not sectaries, like the
Sittars and the author of the Qvetagvatara. Q^iva as a ' patron
of literature ' takes just the place taken by Ganeja in the present beginning of the Mahabharata. Vyasa has here composed the poem -^ but Ganega is invoked as Vighnega, ' Lord of difficulties,' to help the poet write it out. Vyasa does the intellectual work and Ganega performs the manual labor.
Vishnuism, in a word, is the only cultivated (native) sectarian religion of India ; and the orthodox cult, in that it is Vedantic, lies nearer to Vishnuism than to ^ivaism. Why then does one find Qiva invoked by philosophy? Because monotheism in
distinction from pantheism was the belief of the wise in the
first centuries after the Christian era, till the genius of Qankara
1 i. 1. 76.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 489
definitively raised pantheism in alliance with orthodoxy to be the more esteemed ; and because Qiva alone, when the choice lay between him and Vishnu, could be selected as the One God. For Vishnuism was now merged with Krishnaism, a new vulgar cult, and Qiva was an old and venerated god, long since a member of the Brahmanic pantheon. The connection be- /, tween Qivaism and the Sankhya system gave it a more respectable and archaic appearance in the eyes of the conservative
Brahman, while the original asceticism of Qiva undoubtedly appealed much more to Brahmanic feeling than did the sentimentalism of the Vishnuite. In the extreme North, in the ninth century, philosophy and Qivaism are nominally allied,
but really sectarian Qivaism was, the cult of the lowest, not of
the highest classes. Many of the professed Qivaites are to-day^ tending to Vedantism, which is the proper philosophy of the Vishnuite ; and the Qivaite sects are waning before the Vishnuite power, not only in the middle North, where the mass of the population is devoted to Vishnu, but even in Qiva's later
provinces in the extreme South. The social distribution of the'^ \ sectaries in the Middle Ages was such that one may assign older Vishnuism to the middle classes, and Qivaism to the highest on its philosophical and decently ascetic side, but to
the lowest on its phallic and magical side. -^^ But none of the Qivaite sects we have mentioned, imbecile as appear to be the impostors that represent them, are equal in despicable traits to the f Qaktas. These worshippers of the
androgynous Qiva (or of Qakti, the female principle alone), do, indeed, include some Vishnuites among themselves, but they
are originally &.nd prevailingly Qivaite.-' Blood-offerings and if
human sacrifices are a modern and an ancient trait of Qiva
1 The Dabistan, without any animus, reports of the (Qaktas of the seventeenth century that " Qiva is, in their opinion, with little exception^ the highest of the deities" (ii. 7). WilUams calls Qaktaism "a mere offshoot of (Jivaism," Religious Thought and Life, p. 184.



490 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
worship ;i and the hill-tribes of the Vindhya and the classical drama show that the cult of Aghori is a Qivaite manifes
tation which is at once old and derived from un-Aryan sources.
Aghori and all female monsters naturally associate with Qiva,
who is their intellectual and moral counterpart. The older Aghoris exacted human sacrifice in honor of Devi, Parvati, the
wife of (Jiva.^ The adoration of the female side of a god is as old as the Rig Veda, but Qivaism has combined this cult with
features probably derived from other i;idependent local cults,
such as that of Parvati, the "mountain' goddess.' They are all
united in the person .of Qiva's wife of many names, the ' great goddess,' Mahadevi, the 'hard' Durga, Kali, Uma, etc.^ And it is to this ferocious she-monster that the most abject homage of the Qivaites is paid. So great is the terror inspired by Durga
that they that are not Qivaites at all yet join in her festival ;
for which purpose, apparently, she is dubbed Vishnu's " sister.'
But it is not blood-guiltiness alone which is laid at the door of
this cult. The sectarian religions have an -exoteric and an
esoteric side, the religion of the ' right hand ' and of the ' left
hand.' It is the latter (to which belong many that deny the fact) wherein centre the abominations of ^ivaism ; in less
degree, those of Vishnuism also. Obscenity is the soul of this
cult. Bestiality equalled only by the orgies of the Indie sav

Linga-worship has also its counterpart, Bhaga-worship (here Yoni), perhaps represented by the altar itself. Compare the Dabistan, ii. 7, on the (^ivaite interpretation of the Mohammedan altar. To Durga human beings were always sacrificed. After mentioning a gold idol of Durga (to whom men were sacrificed yearly), the author adds: " Even now they sacrifice in every village of the Kohistan of Nandapur and the country adjacent, a man of good family" {ib^.

screened by an Orphic philosophy, for is not Nature or Illusion the female side of the Divine Male ? It is screened again by
religious fervor, for it is pious profligacy that prompts the
rites. It is induced practically by an initial carousal and
drunkenness ; and this is antique, for even the old j(??«fl-feasts were to a great extent drunken revels, and the gods have got drunk from the time of the Vedas ' to do their greatest deeds.
But in practice, ^^kti- worship, when unveiled, amounts to this, that men and women of the same class and family indulge in a Bacchanalian orgy, and that, as they proceed, they give themselves over to every excess which liquor and lust can prompt. A description of the different rites would be to re
duplicate an account of indecencies, of which the least vile is
too esoteric to sketch faithfully. Vaguely to outline one such
religious festival will suffice. A naked woman, the wife of the
chief priest, sits in the middle of the ' holy circle.' She represents Durga, the divine female principle. The Bacchic orgy
begins with hard drinking. Qiva as Bhairava, 'the dreadful,' has his human counterpart also, who must then and there pair with the impersonated Durga. The worship proper consists in the repetition of meaningless mantra syllables and yells
;
the worship improper, in indulgence in 'wine and women ' (par
ticularly enjoined in the rite-books called Tantras). Human
sacrifice at these rites is said to be extinct at the present day.^
comes more and more pronounced in the liturgical hymns of the Rig Veda, and may be especially a trait of the older fire-cult in opposition to soma-c\i\t (compare RV. x. i8. 7). At any rate it is significant that Yoni means the altar itself, and that in the fire-cult the production of fire is represented as resulting from the union of the male and female organs. 1 Nevertheless the Brahmanic, and even the Hinduistic, law-codes condemn all intoxicating liquors except in religious service. To offer such drink to a man of the lower castes, even to a (^udra, is punishable with a fine ; but to offer intoxicating liquor to a priest is punishable with death (Vishnu, v. loo). 2 Formerly performed by the Kararis. " The Qaktas hold the killing of a man to be permitted," Dabistan, ii. 7. " Among them it is a meritorious act to sacrifice a man," ii.

But blood-lust is appeased by the hacking of their own bodies. Garments are cast in a heap. Lots are drawn for the women's garments ^ by the men. With her whose clothes he gets each man continues the debauch, inviting incest in addition to all
other excess.^ The older Vishnuite sects (Pancaratras, etc.) may have had some of this filth in their make-up ; but mass for mass the
practices are characteristic of Qivaism and not of Vishnuism.' Especially Qivaite, however, is the 'mother worship,' to which reference was made in the chapter on epic Hinduism. : These ' mothers ' are guardian goddesses, or fiends of disease, etc. One may not claim that all Qaktas are Qivaites, but how small a part of Vishnuism is occupied with Qakti-worship can be estimated only by surveying the whole body of worshippers of that name. We cannot leave the lust and murder of modern Qivaism without speaking of still another sect which hangs upon the heels of Kali, that of the Thugs. It may, indeed, be questioned whether Qiva should be responsible for the doings of
his spouse, Kali. But like seeks like, and there is every his
torical justification in making out Qiva to be as bad as the company he keeps. Durga and Kali are not vainly looked upon as Qiva's female side. So that a sect like the Thugs,*
1 Hence the name of KSnculiyas {kancidi, a woman's garment). 2 This has no parallel in Vishnuism except among some of the Radha devotees. Among the Radha Vallabhis the vulgarities of the (^ivaites are quite equalled; and the assumption of women's attire by the Sakhl Bhavas of Benares and Bengal ushers in rites as coarse if less bloody than those of the ^ivaites. 3 Of course each god of the male trinity has his C^akti, female principle. Thus Brahma's Qakti is Savitrl (in the epic), or Sarasvatl, or Vac; that of Vishnu is ^ri, or Lakshml, or Radha ; that of ^iva is Uma, Durga, Kali, etc. Together they make a female trinity (Barth, p. 199). So even the Vedic gods had their (later) wives, who, as in the case of Surya, were probably only the female side of a god conceived of as androgynous, like Prajapati in the Brahmanic period. 4 Historically, Thags, like Panjab, Santhals, etc., is the more correct form, but phonetically the forms Thugs, Punjab, Sunthals or Sonthals, are correct, and S, the indeterminate vowel (like o in London), is generally transcribed by u or o (in

which worshipped Kali, may, it is true, be taken out of the
Qivaite sects, but only if one will split Qivaism in two and reproduce the original condition, wherein Qiva was one mon
ster and Kali was another ; which is scarcely possible after
the two have for centuries been looked upon as identical. With this in mind it may be granted that' the Thugs payed reverence to Kali, rather than to her lord. Moreover, many of them were Mohammedans; but, for our purpose, the significant fact is that when the Thugs were Hindus they were KaliQivaites. And we believe that these secret murderers, strange as it seems, originated in a reformatory movement. As is well known, it was a religious principle with them not to spill
blood.'' They always throttled. They were, of course, when they first became known in 1799 (Sherwood's account), nothing but robbers and murderers. But, like the other Q^ivaite mon
strosities, they regarded their work as a religious act, and always invoked Kali if they were Hindus. We think it probable, therefore, that the sect originated among the Kali-wor
shippers as a protest against blood-letting. Admitting that robbery is under Qiva's protection (^iva is ' god of robbers '"), and that Kali wanted victims, a sect probably claimed that the victims should be throttled, and not bled. Not that this was necessarily a new reform. There is every reason to suppose that most of Qiva's females are aboriginal wild-tribe
Punjab, Nepal, the a is pronounced very like au, and is sometimes written so, Punjaub, etc.). 1 Tile Jemidar, captain, gives tlie order to the Buttoat, strangler, who takes the rumal (yard of cotton) with a knot tied in the left end, and, holding his right hand a few inches further up, passes it from behind over the victim's head. As the latter falls the strangler's hands are crossed, and if done properly the Thugs say that " the eyes stand out of the head and life becomes extinct, before the body falls to the ground" (Notes on the ' Thags, Thugs, or Thegs,' by Lieutenant Reynolds ; of whom Lieutenant-Colonel Smythe says that he knew more than any other European about the Thugs, 1836). The Buttoat received eight annas extra for his share. Each actor in the scene had a title ; the victim was called Rosy. For their argot see the Ramaseeana.

divinities. Now among tliese savages one sees at times a distinct refusal to bleed human victims. Thuggery may then have been the claim of an old conservative party, who wished to
keep up the traditional throttling'; though this is pure specula
tion, for, at the time when the sect became exposed, this means of death was merely the safest way to kill. They insisted always on being called Thugs, and scorned the name of thief. They were suppressed by 1840. Reynolds describes them as " mostly men of mild and unobtrusive manners, possessing a
cheerful disposition."
'
THE VISHNUITE SECTS.
There is a formal idealistic Qivaism, as we have shown, and there was once a dualistic Vishnuism ; but in general the Vish
nuite is an idealist. To comprehend the quarrels among the
sects of this religion, however, it will be necessary to examine the radical philosophical differences of their founders, for one passes, in going from modern Qivaism to Vishnuism, out of ignorant superstition into philosophical religion, of which many even of the weaker traits are but recent Hinduistic effeminacy
substituted for an older manly thinking.
1 Thugs (defined as ' knaves ' by Sherwood, more probably ' throttlers ') must be distinguished from Deceits. The latter (Elphinstone, i. 384) are irreligious gangs, secretly bound togetlier to sack villages. Peaceable citizens by day, the Decoits rise at night, attack a village, slay, torture, rob, and disappear before morning, ' melting into the population ' and resuming honest toil. When the police are weak enough they may remain banded together ; otherwise they are ephemerally honest and nocturnally assassins. The Thugs or Phansigars {p/idnsi, noose) killed no women, invoked Kali (as Jayi), and attacked individuals only, whom the decoys, called Tillais, lured very cleverly to destruction. They never robbed without strangling first, and always buried the victim. They used to send a good deal of what they got to Kali's temple, in a village near Mirzapur, where the establishment of priests was entirely supported by them. Kali (or Bhavani) herself directed that victims should be strangled, not bled (so the Thug legend). Their symbol was a pick, emblem of the goddess, unto whom a religious ceremony was performed before and after the murder was committed. Local small bankers often acted as fence for them.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 495
The complex of Vishnuite sects presents at first rather a confused appearance, but we think that we can make the whole
body separate itself clearly enough into its component parts, if
the reader will pause at the threshold and before entering the edifice look at the foundation and the outer plan of Vedantic philosophy. At the beginning of Colebrooke's essays on Hindu philosophy he thus describes four of the recognized systems : " The two Mimamsas . . . are emphatically orthodox. The prior one,
purva,^ which has Jaimini for its founder, teaches the art of reasoning, with the express view of aiding the interpretation of the Vedas. The latter, uttara^ commonly called Vedanta, and attributed to Vyasa (or Badarayana), deduces from the text of the Indian scriptures a refined psychology, which goes to a
denial of a material world. A different philosophical system,
partly heterodox, and partly conformable to the established Hindu creed, is the Sankhya ; of which also, as of the preceding, there are two schools ; one usually known by that name,^ the other commonly termed Yoga."* The eldest of these systems, as we have already had occasion to state, is the dualistic Sankhya. It was still highly
esteemed in the ninth century, the time of the great Vedantist,
Qankara.^ A theistic form of this atheistic philosophy is called the Puranic Sankhya, and Patanjali's Yoga is thoroughly theistic. Radically opposed to the dualistic Sankhya stands the Vedanta," based on the Upanishads that teach the identity of spirit and matter. '
1 This is called either Piirva-mimamsa (Karma-mlmamsa) or simply MImamsa. 2 Or Qarlraka-mlmamsa, or Brahma-mlmamsa {mtmamsa, reflexion, philosophy). 3 Kapila's system, usually known as the Sankhya. * And attributed to Pataiijali. Compare Deussen, System des Vedanta, p. 20. 5 Born in 788. But some scholars refer him to the seventh century. See lA. xiii. 95 ; xvi. 41. His name, a title of Qiva, indicates his nominal sect. 6 For the meaning of Vedanta (whether ' end of Veda,' or ' goal of Veda ') compare Deussen, loc. cit. p. 3, note (above, p. 253, note).



496 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
As representative of the metaphysics of the Sankhya and Vedanta systems respectively stand in general the two great
religions of India. The former, as we have shown, is still
potent in the great Song of the epic, and its principles are
essentially those of early Qivaism. The latter, especially in
its sectarian interpretation, with which we have now to deal, has become the great religion of India. But there are two
sectarian interpretations of Vishnu, and two philosophical
interpretations of the All-spirit in its relation to the individual
soul or spirit. "^ Again the individual spirit of man either
enjoys after death immortal happiness, as a being distinct
from the All-spirit ; or the jiva, individual spirit, is absorbed
into the All-spirit (losing all individuality, but still conscious
of happiness) ; or the individual spirit is absorbed into an Allspirit that has no happiness or affection of any kind. Now the strict philosophy of the Vedanta adopts the last
view in toto. The individual spirit (soul, self) becomes one
with the universal Spirit, losing individuality and conscious
ness, for the universal Spirit itself is not affected by any quality
or condition. A creative force without attributes, this is the All-spirit of Qankara and of the strict Vedantist. To Qankara
the Creator was but a phase of the All-spirit, and the former's immortality ended with his creation ; in other words, there is no immortal Creator, only an immortal creative power. In the twelfth century arose another great leader of thought, Ramanuja. He disputed the correctness of Qankara's inter
pretation of Vedantic principles. It is maintained by some
that ^ankara's interpretation is really correct, but for our purpose that is neither here nor there. ^ Qankara's hrahma is the
1 The Supreme Spirit or All-Spirit is either purely non-dualistic or qiialifiedly non-dualistic ; in the latter event he is, says the sectary, identical with Vishnu, who may be represented either by Krishna or Rama (sub-sects). Pure non-duality (unconditioned dtmd) was taught by (^ankara. 2 Gough, Philosophy of the Upanishads. Compare Williams, loc. cit. In our own view the unsystematic Upanishads teach both doctrines (above, p. 228, note).



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 497
one and only being, pure being, or pure thought. Thought is not an attribute of brakma, it is brahma. Opposed to this pure being (thought) stands mdyd, illusion, the material cause
of the seen world. It is neither being nor not-being ; it is ths
cause of the appearance of things, in that it is associated with brahma, and in so far only is brahma rightly the Lord. The
infinite part of each individual is brahma; the finite part is mdyd. Thus Badarayana (author of the Vedanta Sutras) says that the individual is only illusion. Ramanuja,^ on the other hand, teaches a brahma that is not only universal, but is the universal personal Lord, a supreme conscious and willing God. Far from being devoid of attributes, like Qankara's brahma, the brahma of Ramanuja has
all attributes, chief of which is thought or intelligence. The Lord contains in himself the elements of that plurality which ^ankara regards as illusion. As contrasted with the dualistic"^ Sankhya philosophy both of these systems inculcate monism.
But according to ^ankara all difference is illusion ; while according to Ramanuja brahma is not homogeneous, but in the diversity of the world about us he is truly manifested. Qankara's mdyd is Ramanuja's body of {brahma) the Lord. Qan- ^,
kara's personal god exists only by collusion with illusion, and
hence is illusory. The brahma of Ramanuja is a personal god, the omnipotent, omniscient. Lord of a real world. Moreover, from an eschatological point of view, ^ankara explains
salvation, the release from re-birth, samsdra, as complete union
with this unqualified brahma, consequently as loss of individ
uality as well as loss of happiness. But Ramanuja defines
salvation as the departure from earth forever of the individual
1 Before Ramanuja it was taught by Qandilya that brahma (and the individual spirit) was conditioned, a doctrine supposed to be that of the old Bhagavatas or Paricaratras ; but this is quite uncertain. The (^andilyan chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad (above, p. 221) may be thus interpreted, viz., that the (conditioned) individual spirit is identical with brahma.



498 THE RELIGIONS, OF INDIA.
spirit, which enters a heaven where it will enjoy perennial
bliss. "^ Ramanuja's doctrine inspires the sectarian pantheism of the
present time. In this there is a metaphysical basis of con
duct, a personal god to be loved or feared, the hope of bliss
hereafter. In its essential features it is a very old belief, far older than the philosophy which formulates it.^ Thus, after the hard saying "fools desire heaven," this desire reasserted itself, and under Ramanuja's genial interpretation of the Vedanta Sutras the pious man was enabled to build up his cheerful hope again, withal on the basis of a logic as difficult
to controvert as was that of Qankara himself.' Thus far the product of Vedantism is deism. But now with two steps one arrives at the inner portal of sectarianism. First, if brahma is a personal god, which of the gods is he, this personal All-spirit ? As a general thing the Vedantist answers, ' he is Vishnu ' ; and adds, ' Vishnu, who embraces
as their superior those other gods, Qiva, and Brahma.' But the sectary is not content with making the All-god one with Vishnu. Vishnu was manifested in the flesh,- some say as Krishna, some say as Rama.^ The relation of sectary to Vish
nuite, and to the All-spirit deist, may be illustrated most clearly by comparison with Occidental religions. One may not acknowledge any personal god as the absolute Supreme Power ; again, one may say that this Supreme Power is a
1 Thibaut, Introduction to the Vedanta Sutras^ SBE. xxxiv. p. xxxi; Deussen, System des Vedanta, p. 469. 2 Philosophical illusion, mdyd, appears first in late Upanishads. 3 The author of the Dabistan (seventeenth century) tells a Berkeleyan story in regard to Qankara's doctrine of illusion. His enemies wished to test his belief in his own philosophy ; so they drove an elephant at him, on which the philosopher ran away. " Ho ! '' they jeered, " Did you not maintain that all was a mere illusion ? Then an elephant is illusion. Yet you take to flight before it." " Yes," replied the philosopher, " all is illusion ; there was no elephant, and there was no flight " (ii. 4). 4 The Smarta (orthodox) Brahman believes, on the other hand, that Vishnu, (Jiva, and Brahma are all mere forms of the Supreme AtmJ.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 499
personal god, Jehovah ; again, Jehovah may or may not be , regarded as one with Christ. The minuter ramifications of the Christian churcli then correspond to the sub-sects of Krishnaism or Ramaism.^ The Occidental and Oriental conceptions of the trinity are, however, not identical. For in India the trinity, from the Vishnuite point of view, is an amalgamation of Civa and Brahma with Vishnu, irrespective of the question whether Vishnu be manifest in Krishna or not ; while the Christian trinity amalgamates the form that corresponds to Vishnu with the one that corresponds to Krishna.^ To the orthodox Brahman, on the other hand, as Williams has very well put it, Krishna is an incarnation of Vishnu, who is himself only an incarnation, that is, a form, of God. Having now explained the two principal divisions of the modern sects, we can lead the reader into the church of Vishnu. It is a church of two great parties, each being variously sub
divided. Of these two parties the Krishnaites are intellectually ' the weaker, and hence numerically the stronger. All Krishnaites, of course, identify the man-god Krishna with Vishnu,
and their sub-sects revert to various teachers, of whom the
larger number are of comparatively recent date, 'although as a body the Krishnaites may claim an antiquity as great, if not greater, than that of the Ramaites.
But the latter party, in their various sub-sects, all claim as
1 If Mohammed were regarded as one with Allah there would be an Occidental parallel to the Krishna and Rama sects. 2 Whether the Hindu trinitarianism derives from the Occident or not (the former view being historically probable, but not possible to prove) the importance of the dogma and its place in Hindu theology is very different to the condition of things in the Christian church. In India trinitarianism is merely a convenience in adjusting the claims of two heterodox sects and orthodoxy, each believer being willing to admit that the god of the other is his own god, only with the understanding that the last is a superior manifestation. In late Qivaism both Vishnu and Brahma are indeed called the 'sons of God' (Qiva). but in the sense that they are distinctly subordinate creatures of (Jiva (JAOS. iv. 147).



500 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
their founder either Ramanuja himself or one of his followers
;
and since, if the claim be granted, the Rama sects do but continue his work, we shall begin by following out the result of his
teaching as it was interpreted by his disciples ; especially since the Krishnaites have left to the Ramaites most of the philosophizing of the church, and devoted themselves more exclu
sively to the moralities and immoralities of their more practical
religion. As a matter of fact, the Ramaites to-day are less
religious than philosophical^^while in the case of the Krishna
ites, with some reservations, the contrary may be said to be
the case.
THE RAMAITES.
Since the chief characteristic of growth among Hindu sec
taries is a sort of segmentation, like that which conditions the development of amoebas and other lower organisms, it is a foregone conclusion that the Ramaites, having formed one body apart from the Krishnaites, will immediately split up again
into smaller segments. It is also a foregone conclusion, since
one is really dealing here with human types, that these smaller segments will mutually hate and despise each other much more than they hate their common adversaries. Just as, in old times, a Calvinist hated a Lutheran more than he did a Russian Christian (for he understood his quarrel better), so a ' cat-doctrine ' Ramaite hates a ' monkey-doctrine ' Ramaite far more than he hates a Krishnaite, while with a ^'vaite he often has an amicable union ; although the Krishnaite belittles the Ramaite's manifestation of Vishnu, and the Qivaite belittles Vishnu himself.^
1 But some Hindus worship both Vishnu and (Jiva without insisting that one is higher than the other. Moreover, there is a Mahratta sect of Vishnuites who complacently worship Buddha (Vishnu's ninth avatar) as Viththala or Panduraiiga. These are simply eclectic, and their god is without or with quality. Buddha is hero not a deceiver, but an instructor (JRAS. 1842, p. 66; lA. xi. 56, 149).



MODERN HINDU SECTS. SOI
The chief point of difference theologically between the Ramaites is the one just mentioned. The adherents of the ' cat
doctrine ' teach that God saves man as a cat takes up its kitten,
without free-will on the part of the latter. The monkey-doctrinaires teach that man, in order to be saved, must reach out to their God (Rama, who is Vishnu, who, again, is All-god, that is, brahma), and embrace their God as a monkey does its mother.'' The resemblance to the Occidental sects here becomes still more interesting. But we have given an earlier example of
the doctrine of free grace from the epic, and can now only locate the modern sects that still argue the question. The ' monkey
'
Ramaites are a sect of the North {vadd), and hence are called -'
Vada-galais ; ^ the ' cat ' or Calvinistic Ramaites of the South (ten) *
are called Ten-galais. Outwardly these sects differ in having diverse mantras, greetings, dress, and especially in the foreheadsigns, which show whether the ' mark of Vishnu ' shall represent (Vadagal belief) one or (Tengal) two feet of the god (expressed by vertical lines ^ painted fresh daily on the forehead). The Ten-galais, according to a recent account, are the more numer
ous and the more materialistic.^
All the Ramaites, on the other hand, hold that (i) the deity \ is not devoid of qualities ; (2) Vishnu is the deity and should be worshipped with Lakshmi, his wife ; (3) Rama is the human avatar of Vishnu ; (4) Ramanuja and all the great teachers since his day are also avatars of Vishnu. / In upper India, about the Ganges, Ramanuja's disciple,

The Southern school has its own Veda written in Tamil. Williams, JRAS. xiv. 301. According to the same writer the Ten-galais hold that Vishnu's wife is iinite, created, and a mediator; the Vada-galais, that she is infinite, and_ uncreated. 3 All Vishnuites have the vertical sign ; (J^ivaites have a horizontal sign (on the forehead). ^ Proceed. AOS. 1894, p. lii. The Vada-school may be affected by (Jivaism.

Ramanand (fifth in descent), wlio lived in the fourteenth century, has more followers than has the founder. His disciples
worship the divine ape, Hanuman ^ (conspicuous in both epics),
as well as Rama. They are called ' the liberated,' Avadhutas,
but whether because they are freed from caste-restrictions,^ or from the strict rules of eating enjoined by Ramanuja, is doubt
ful. Ratnanand himself had in turn twelve disciples. Of these the most famous is Kabir, whose followers, the Kabir Panthis (sect), are widely spread, and of whom no less a person than
Nanak, the Sikh, claimed to be a successor. But it will be more convenient to describe the Sikhs hereafter. Of Ramanand's other disciples that founded sects may be mentioned Kil, whose sectaries, the Khakis, of Oude, unite successfully Rama-worship, Hanuman-worship, and Qivaite fashions (thus presenting a mixture like that of the southern Madhvas, who unite the images of Qiva and Vishnu). The Ras Dasa sect, again, owes to its founder the black Qalagrama pebble, an object of reverent awe, which gives rise to a sort of sub-cult subsequently imitated by others.^ Another widely-spread sect which claim Ramanand as their founder's teacher is that of the Dadu Panthis. This branch also of the Ramaites we shall more appropriately discuss under the head of deism (below). Finally, we have to mention, as an outcome of the Ramanand faith, the modern
1 A divine monkey appears in tlie Rig Veda, but not as an object of devotion. 2 Tlie teachers of tlie Ramaites are generally Brahmans, but no disciples are excluded because of their caste. Ramanuja adopted the monastic system, which (^ankara is said to have taken from the Buddhists and to have introduced into Brahmanic priestly life. Both family priests and cenobites are admitted into his order. 8 What the Linga is to Qivaite the Qalagrama is to the Vishnuite (who also reveres the tulasi wood). The (Jalagrama is a black pebble; the Linga is a white pebble or glass (Williams). The C^ivaites have appropriated the dui'vd grass as sacred to Gane§a. Sesamum seeds and durvd are, however, Brahmanically holy. Compare Qat. Br. iv. 5. 10, where durvd grass is even hoUer than /i'z^^«-grass. The rosaries used by the sects have been the subject of a paper by Leumann, and are described by Williams. Thirty-two or sixty-four berries of eleocarpus ganitrus (rudrdkshd) make the (Jivaite rosary. That of the Vishnuite is made of lotus-seeds or of tulsl wood in one hundred and eight pieces.

Ramayana, Ramcaritmanas, the new bible of the sect, composed in the sixteenth century by Tulasidasa (" slave of Vishnu '), the greatest of modern Hindu poets. What the Divine Song and the Bhagavata Purana are to the Krishnaite, the older (epic)Ramayana of Valmiki and Tulasidasa's new poem (of the same name) are to the Ramaite.^
THE KRISHNAITES.
There are two great sects that worship Vishnu as especially manifested in the human form of Krishna. But, as distinguished from the philosophical Ramaite, the Krishnaite 'is not satisfied
with a declaration of faith in the man-god, and in fact his I chief cultj is of the child-god Krishna, the Bala Gopala or Infant Shepherd. This recalls the older Krishna (of the Harivanga), whose
sporting with the milk-maids is a favorite topic in later Krishnaite literature. As a formulated cult, consisting for the most
part of observances based on the mystic side of affection for the personal saver of man (the bhakti principle of ' devotion,'
erotically expanded''), this worship obtains both among Caitanyas and Vallabhas, sects that arose in the sixteenth century.^
Caitanya, born in Bengal in 1485, of whom it is fabled that wise
1 For an account and list of the works of Tulasidasa (Tulsldas), compare lA. xxii. 89, 122, 227, Jayadeva (twelfth century), the author of the Gita Govinda (translated by Jones, Lassen, and Riickert), is sometimes reckoned falsely to the adherents of Ramanand, but he is really a Krishnaite. 2 The bhakti doctrine is that of the extant (Jandilya Sutras, which make faith and not works or knowledge a condition of salvation. They are modern, as Cowell, in his preface to the work, has shown. Cowell here identifies Kagyapa with Kanada, the Vaijeshika philosopher, his school holding that the individual spirits are infinite in number, distinct from the Supreme Spirit. 3 The infant-cult is of course older than these sects. For an account of the ritual, as well as its intrusion into the earlier cult of the Puranas, with the accompanying resemblances to Madonna-cult, and the new features (the massacre of the innocents, the birth in the stable, the three wise men, etc.) that show borrowing from Christianity, compare Weber's exhaustive treatise referred to above, the Krsnajanmastami, Krishna's Gehiirtsfest.

men came and gave homage to him while he was yet a child,
was active in Bengal and Orissa, where his sect (named after him) is one of the most important at the present day. Caitanya
preached a practical as well as a theoretical reform. He taught
the equality of all worsliippers of whatever caste, and the religious virtue of marriage. At the present day caste-feeling and
religious profession are somewhat at variance. But a compromise is affected. While in the temple the high-caste Caitanyas
regard their lowly co-religionists as equals ; when out of it
they become again arrogantly high-caste. Making a virtue
,of marriage instead of celibacy caused the sect to become popular with the middle and lower classes, but its adherents are usually drawn from the dregs of the populace.^ The principle
of love for God (that is, for Krishna) is especially dwelt upon
by Caitanya. The devotee should feel such affection as is felt
by a young man for a girl. To exercise or inspire this rapt
and mystic devotion, recourse is had to singing, dancing, and
other familiar means of arousing religious fervor. If the danc
ing devotee swoons it is a sign that God accepts his love. At the present day Caitanya himself is regarded as the incarnate
deity. He and his two chief disciples, who (like all Gosains,
religious Teachers) are divine, form a little sub-trinity for the
sect.'' This sect, like so many others, began as a reform, only to become worse than its rivals. Vallabha or Vallabhacarya, ' Teacher Vallabha,' was also of
the sixteenth century, but his sect belongs especially to the
Northwest, while the sphere of Caitanya's influence was in the Northeast. He lived near the Ganges, is said to have been a scholar, and wrote a commentary on the early life of Krishna in the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, and on the Divine

enjoy.' No mortification of the senses is allowed. Human love typifies divine love.^ The teachers acquired great renown and power, assuming and maintaining the haughty title of maha
rajas ('great kings'). They are as gods, and command absolutely their devotees.^ Here the worship of the Infant Krishna reaches its greatest height (or depth). The image of the infant god is daily clothed, bathed, anointed, and worshipped.
Religious exercises have more or less of an erotic tendency, and here, if anywhere, as one may learn from Wilson, Williams, and
other modern writers on this sect, there are almost as great excesses as are committed among the Qivaite sects. As a sect it is an odd combination of sensual worship and theological speculation, for they have considerable sectarian literature. The most renowned festival of the Infant Krishna is the cele-'^N
bration of the stable-birth of Krishna and of the Madonna (bearing him on her breast), but this we have discussed already. Besides this the Jagannath procession in Bengal and Orissa, and the great autumnal picnic called the Ras Yatra, are famous occasions for displaying Krishnaite, or, indeed, general Vishnuite zeal. At the Ras Yatra assemble musicians, dancers, jug
glers, and other joy-creating additions to the religious feast, the ostensible reason for which is the commemoration of Krishna's dances with the milk-maids. The devotees belong chiefly to,' the wealthy middle classes. These low sects worship Krishna

The best mode of propitiating the god Krishna is by ministering to the sensual- appetites of his vicars upon earth.

with Radha (his mistress, instead of Lakshmi, Vishnu's wife). Here, too, as Krishnaites rather than as Vishnuites, are found the ' left-hand ' worshippers of the female power.' This sensual corruption of Vishnuism, which is really not Vishnuism but simple Krishnaism, led to two prominent reforms within the fold. Among the Vallabhas arose in protest the Caran Dasis, who have taken from the Madhvas of the South their Ten Commandments (against lying, reviling, harsh
speech, idle talk, theft, adultery, injury to life, imagining evil, hate, and pride); and evolved for themselves the tenet that faith without works is dead. The same protest was made against the Vallabhas by Svami Narayana. He was born about 1780 near Lucknow, and advocated a return to Vallabha's purer faith, which had been corrupted. Probably most of the older reformers have had much the same career as had- Svami Narayana. Exalted by the people, who were persuaded by his mesmeric eloquence, he soon became a political figure, a mar
tyr of persecution, a triumphant victor, and then an ascetic, living in seclusion ; whence he emerged occasionally to go on tours " like a bishop visiting his diocese " (Williams). He is worshipped as a god.^ The sect numbers to-day a quarter of a million, some being celibate clergy, some householders. In contrast^ to Vishnuism the following points are characteristic of orthodox Brahmanism (Qankara's Vedantism): The
1 On these sects see Wilson, Hunter (Statistical Account), Williams, JRAS. xiv. 289. The festival verses in honor of the Madonna are : " Honor to thee, Devaki, who hast borne Krishna; may the goddess who destroys sin be satisfied, revered by me. Mother of God art thou, Aditi, destroying sin. I will honor thee as the gods honor thee," etc. {^^c^x^Janvidstanii, p. 286). The birth-day celebration is not confined to Krishnaites ; but in the Rama sect, though they celebrate the birth, they do not represent the man-god as a suckling. In other respects this feast is imitated from that of Krishna (Weber, p. 310, note). The Ramacandra celebration takes place in the spring. The birth-day of Ganega is also celebrated by the (^ivaites (in August-September). 2 He himself claimed to be an incarnate god. He adopted the qualified nonduality of Ramanuja. See Williams' account of him and of the two great temples of the sect, loc. cit.

orthodox believe that there is one spirit in three forms, co
eternal impersonal essences — being, knowledge, and joy.
When it wills it becomes personal, exists in the object, knows,
rejoices, associating itself with illusion. In this state it has
three corporeal forms, causal, subtile, gross. With the causal
body (identified with illusion, ignorance) it becomes the Su
preme Lord, that is, the totality of dreamless human spirits.
With the subtile form it becomes the golden seed, or threadspirit (dreaming spirits) ; with the gross form it becomes Viraj, Vai^vanara, the waking spirit. The lowest state is that of being wide awake. The personal god (Brahma, Vishnu, Q!iva,
of the sectaries) is this it as influenced by the three qualities,
rajas, sattva, tamas (passion, truth, and ignorance), respectively.
Three essences, three corporeal forms, and three qualities con
stitute, therefore, the threefold trinity of the orthodox, who
are called Smartas, they that 'hold to tradition.'^ What the
sectary rejects, namely, the scriptures (Veda and Upanishads, etc.) and the caste system, that the orthodox retains ; what the
sectary holds, namely, Ramanuja's qualified non-duality, and absolute godhead in ^iva or Krishna, that the orthodox rejects (although he may receive the sectary's god into his pantheon).
Some of the sects still keep respect for caste, excusing their
respect on the ground that " it is well enough for God to ignore
social distinctions, but not for man." But caste-distinctions
are generally ignored, or there is positive hate of the Brahman.
In antithesis to the orthodox, the sectaries all hold one other
important tenet. From the idea of bhakti, faith or devotion, was developed that of love for Krishna, and then (as an indication of devotion) the confession of the name of the Lord as a means of grace. Hence, on the one hand, the meaningless

repatition of the sect's special kirttan, or liturgies, and mantra,
or religious formula ; the devotion, demanded by the priest, of
man, tan, dhan (mind, body,^ and property); and finally, the
whole theory of death-bed confessions. Sinner or heretic, if
one die at last with Krishna's name upon the lips he will be

'
Of the sub-divisions of the sub-sects that we have described,
the numbers often run into scores. But either their differences
are based on indifferent matters of detail in the cult and religious practice ; or. the new sect is distinguished from the old simply by its endeavor to make for greater holiness or purity
as sub-reformers of older sects. For all the sects appear to
begin as reformers, and later to split up in the process of
re-reformation.
Two general classes of devotees, besides these, remain to be spoken of. The Sannyasin, 'renouncer,' was of old a Brahman ascetic. Nowadays, according to Wilson, he is generally a Qivaite mendicant. But any sect may have its Sannyasins, as it may have its Vairagins, ' passionless ones' ; although the latter name generally applies to the Vishnuite ascetics of the South. Apart from all these sects, and in many ways most remarkable, are the sun-worshippers. All over India the sun was
(and is) worshipped, either directly (as to-day by the Sauras),^
or as an incarnate deity in the form of the priest Nimba-aditya, who is said to have arrested the sun's course at one time and to be the sun's representative on earth. Both Puranic authority and inscriptional evidence attest this more direct* continuance
1 Among the Vallabhas (above, p. 505). The Teacher is the chief god of most of the Vallabhas (Earth, p. 235). For the Viththal view of caste see I A. xi. 152. 2 It is true of otlier sectaries also, Ramaites and C^ivaites, that the mere repetition of their god's name is a means of salvation. 3 Now chiefly in the South. The Dabistan gives several divisions of sun-worshippers.

of the old Vedic cult. Some of the finest old temples of India, both North and South, were dedicated to the sun.
DEISTIC REFORMING SECTS.
We have just referred to one or two reforming sects that
still hold to the sectarian deity. Among these the Madhvas, founded by (Madhva) .A nandatlrtha, are less Krishnaite or Ramaite than Vishnuite,^ and less Vishnuite than deist in general ; so much so that Williams declares they must have got their precepts from Christianity, though this is open to Earth's
objection that the reforming deistic sects are so located as to make it more probable that they derive from Mohammedanism. Madhva was born about 1200 on the western coast, and opposed ^ankara's pantheistic doctrine of non-duality. He taught that
the supreme spirit is essentially different to matter and to the
individual spirit.^ He of course denied absorption, and, though a Vishnuite, clearly belonged in spirit to the older school before Vishnuism became so closely connected with Vedanta doctrines. It is the same Sankhyan Vishnuisrn that one sees in the Divine Song, that is, duality, and a continuation of Qandilya's ancient heresy.^
Here ends the course of India's native religions. From a
thousand years B.C. to as many years after she is practically uninfluenced by foreign doctrine, save in externals. It is of course permissible to separate the reforming sects of

They are generally known by their founder's name, but are also called Brahma-Sampradayins, ' Brahma-adherents.' ^ So the Pa^upata doctrine is that the individual spirit is different to the supreme lord and also to matter {pa^a, the fetter that binds the individual spirit, /rtf;^, and keeps it from its l^ori, pa^upati). The fact is that every sectary is more a irionotheist than a pantheist. Especially is this true of the C^ivaite. The supreme is to him (^iva. 3 Wilson gives a full account of this sect in the Asiaiick Researches, xvi, p. 100.

the last few decades from the older reformers ; but since we see both in their aim and in their foreign sources (amalgama
tion with cis-Indic belief) only a logical if not an historical
continuance of the older deists, we prefer to treat of them all as factors of one whole ; and, from a broader point of view, as
successors to the still older pantheistic and unitarian reformers who first predicated a supreme spirit as ens realissimum, when still surrounded by the clouds of primitive polytheism. Kabir and Dadu, the two most important of the more modern reformers, we have named above as nominal adherents of the
Ramanand sect. But neither was really a sectarian Vishnuite.^
Kabir, probably of the beginning of the fifteenth century, the most famous of Ramanand's disciples, has as religious
descendants the sect of the Kabir Panthis. But no less an organization than that of the Sikhs look back to him, pretend
ing to be his followers. The religious tenets of the Kabir Panthis may be described as those of unsectarian Unitarians^ They conform to no rites or mantras. Kabir assailed all idol
atry, ridiculed the authority of all scriptures, broke with Pundit
and with Mohammedan, taught that outer form is of no consequence, and that only the 'inner man ' is of importance. These Panthis are found in the South, but are located chiefly in and about Benares, in Bengal in the East, and in Bombay in the West. There are said to be twelve divisions of them. Kabir
assailed idolatry, but alas ! Discipline requires subordination. The Guru, Teacher, must be obeyed. It was not long before
1 Of the Kabir Panthis Wilson says : " It is no part of their faith to worship any Hindu deity." A glance at tlie Dabistan will preclude the possibility of claiming much originality for the modern deism of India. This work was written in 1645, and its Persian author describes, as a matter of every-day occurrence, religious debates between 'Jews, Nazarines, Mussulmen, and Hindus,' who meet more to criticise than to examine, but yet to hear explained in full the doctrines of their opponents, in just such tourneys of argument as we showed to be popular among the priests of the Upanishads and epic. Speaking of the Vedas, the author says that every one derives from them arguments in favor of his own creed, whether it be philosophical, mystical, unitarian, atheistic. Judaic, or Christian. Dabistan, vol. ii, p. 45.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. SIl
he who rejected idolatry became himself a deity. And in fact, every Teacher, Guru, of the sect was an absolute master of
thought, and was revered as a god.'
In the fifteenth century, near Lfahore, was born Nanak (1469), who is the nominal founder of the Sikhs, a body which, as Nanak claimed, was a sect embodying the religion of Kabir himself, of whom he claimed to be a. follower. The Granth,
or bible of the Sikhs, was first compiled by the pontiff Arjun,
in tjie sixteenth century. Besides the portions written by
Nanak and Arjun himself, there were collected into it extracts from the works of ' twelve and a half ' other contributors to the volume, Kabir, Ramanand, etc.^ This Granth was subsequently called the Adigranth, or First Book, to distinguish it
from the later, enlarged, collection of several books, one of which was written by Guru Govind, the tenth Sikh pontiff. The change from a religious body to a church militant and political body was made by this Govind in the eighteenth
century.^ The religious sect settled in the Punjab, became wealthy, excited the greed of the government, was persecuted, rose in revolt, triumphed, and eventually ruled the province.
One of the first to precipitate the uprising was the above-men
tioned Arjun (fourth pontiff after Nanak). He played the
king, was accused of rebellion, imprisoned, and probably killed by the Mohammedans. The Sikhs flew to arms, and from this time on they were perforce little more than robbers and plunderers. Govind made the final change in organization, and,
1 Before election the Guru must be examined. If tlie faitliful are not satisfied, they may reject him, but, having elected him, they are bound to obey him implicitly. He can excommunicate, but he may not punish, corporally. This deification of the Guru was retained by the Sikhs, and the office was made hereditary among them (by Arjun), till Govind, the tenth pontiff, who left no successor, declared that after his death the Granth (bible) should be the sole authority of the church. 2 The * half ' contributor was a woman, and hence was not- iBckoned as a complete
unit. 8 The word Sikh means 'disciple' (of Nanak). The name the Sikhs assumed as a nation was Singhs {simhas), ' Lions of the Punjab.'



512 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
SO to speak, at one blow created a nation, for the church at
his hands was converted into the united militant body called
Khalsa under the Guru aSv pontiff-king, with a ' council of chiefs.' They were vowed to hate the Mohammedan and Hindu. All caste-distinctions were abrogated. Govind insti
tuted the worship of Steel and Book (sword and bible). His orders were : " If you meet a Mohammedan, kill him ; if you meet a Hindu, beat and plunder him." The Sikhs invoked the 'Creator' as 'highest lord,' either in the form of Vishnu or Rama. Their founder, Nanak, kept, however, the Hindu tradi
tions in regard to rites. He was a travelled merchant, and is said to have been in Arabia. As an example of the Sikh bible
may serve the following extracts, translated from the original
dialect By Trumpp and Prinsep respectively
:
From Trumpp :
True is the Lord, of a true name, But the import of (this) language is infinite. They say and beg, give, give
!
The Liberal gives presents. What may again be put before (him) By which his court may be seen ? What word may be spoken by the mouth, Which having heard he may bestow love ? Early reflect on the greatness of the True Name.^ From his beneficence comes clothing, From his look the gate of salvation. Nanak (says): Thus it is known, That he himself is altogether truthful.
From Prinsep
:
Thou art the Lord, to thee be praise
;
All life is with thee. Thou art my parents ; I, thy child. All happiness is from thy mercy. No one knows God. i

MODERN HINDU SECTS. 513
Highest Lord among the highest, Of all that is thou art the regulator, And all that is from thee obeys thy will. Thy movements, thy pleasure ; thou alone knowest. Nanak, thy slave is a free-will offering unto thee.'
The religious side of this organization remained under the
name of Udasis,^ or Nirmalas ('spotless ones'). The Adigranth was extended by other additions, such as that of Govind
(above), and now constitutes a large heterogeneous collection
of hymns and moral rules. , Seven sub-sects of the religious body were developed in course of time. The military body has a well-known history. They were complete masters of the Punjab in 1764, and remained there as an independent race till that province was occupied by the British in 1848. Both Kabir and his follower Nanak were essentially reformers. They sought for a religion which should rest on the common truths of Hinduism and Mohammedanism.^ As a matter of form the political party of Govind, the Govind Singhs, or Simhis, worshipped the Hindu gods, and they showed respect for the Brahman priests for a long while ; but they rejected the Vedas and
caste — the two most essential features of orthodoxy.* Dadu, the second great reformer, who shows Mohammedan influence quite as plainly as does Kabir, also claimed Rama
nand as his teacher. The sects that revert to Dadu, Dadu Panthis, now number more than half an hundred. Some of
the votaries are soldiers ; some are mendicants. The founder lived about the end of the sixteenth century. The outward

514 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
practices of the sects differ somewhat from those of other sects. Like Persians, they expose their dead. They- are found about Ajmir and other districts of the North, in the seats of the Jains.
Their faith and reformatory tendency may be illustrated by the following extract, as translated by Wilson •?
" He is my God who maketh all things perfect. O foolish one, God is not far from you. He is near you. God's power is always with you. Whatever is to be is God's will. What will be will be. Therefore, long not for grief or joy, because by seeking the one you may find the other. All things are sweet to them that love God- I am satisfied with this, that happiness is in, proportion to devotion. O God, Thou who art truth,, grant me contentment, love, devotion, and faith. . . . Sit ye with humility at the feet of God, and rid yourselves of the sickness of your bodies. From the wickedness of the bodjf there is much to fear, because all sins enter into it. Therefore, let your dwelling be with the fearless, and direct yourselves toward the light of God. For there neither s,word nor poison have power to destroy, and sin cannot enter. The greatest wisdom is in preventing your minds from being influenced by bad passions, and in meditating upon the One God. Afford help also to the poor stranger. Meditate on Him by whom all things were made."
This tradition of reform is maintained by others without intermission down to the present century, and the Madhvas and Svami Narayana, of whom we have spoken above as being more directly connected with sectarian bodies, are, in fact,
scarcely more concerned with the tenets of the latter than were Kabir and Dadu. Thus the seventeenth century sees the rising of the Babalals and Sadhus ; and the eighteenth, of the Satnamis, ' worshippers of the true name,' who, with other minor bodies, such as the Nangi Panthis, founded by Dedraj in this century, are really pure deists, although some of them, like the
Viththals, claim to be followers of Kabir. And so they are,
in spirit at least.
1 With some small verbal alterations. 2 The conclusion of this extract shows the narrower polemic spirit : " Pundits and Qazis are fools. What avails it to collect a heap of books.? Let your minds freely meditate on the spirit of God. Wear not away your lives by studying the Vedas."

THE DEISM OF TO-DAY.i
And thus one arrives at modern deism, not as the result of new influences emanating from Ciiristian teaching, but ratlier as the legitimate successor of that deism which became almost
monotheistic in the first centuries after our era, and has ever
since varied with various reformers between two beliefs, inclin
ing now to the pantheistic, now to the unitarian conception, as the respective reformers were influenced by Vedanta or Sankhya (later Mohammedan) doctrine. The first of the great modern reformers is Rammohun Roy, who was born in 1772, the son of a high-caste Krishnaite Brahman. He studied Persian and Arabic literature at Patna, the centre of Indie Mohammedan learning. When a mere boy, he composed a tract against idolatry which caused him to be banished from home. He lived at Benares, the stronghold' of Brahmanism, and afterwards in Tibet, the centre of Buddhism. "From his earliest years," says Williams, "he displayed an eagerness to become an unbiassed student of all the religions of the globe." He read the Vedas, the Pali Buddhist works, the Kuran, and the Old Testament in the original ; and in later years even studied Greek that he might properly understand the New Testament. The scholastic philosophy of the Hindus appeared to him, however, as something superior to what he found elsewhere, and his efforts were directed mainly
to purifying the national faith, especially from idolatry. It
was at his instigation that the practice of widow-burning was
abolished (in 1829) by the British. He was finally ostracized
from home as a schismatic, and retired to Calcutta, uniting about him a small body of Hindus and Jains, and there estab
1 For the data of the following paragraphs on the deistic reformers of to-day we are indebted to an article of Professor Williams, which first appeared in the thirteenth volume of the Joicrnal of the Royal Astatic Society^ and has since been published in the same author's Brahmanism and Hinduism.



516 THE 'RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
lished a sort of church or sect, the Atmiya Sabha, ' spiritual society' (1816), which met at his house, but eventually was
crushed by the hostility of the orthodox priests. He finally adopted a kind of Broad-church Christianity or Unitarianism,
and in 1820, in his ' Precepts of Jesus ' and in one of his later works, admits that the simple moral code of the New Testa
ment and the doctrines of Christ were the best that he knew. He never, however, abjured caste ; and his adoption of Chris
tianity, of course, did not include the dogma of the trinity
:
"Whatever excuse maybe pleaded in favor of a plurality of persons of the Deity can be offered with equal propriety in, defence of polytheism " (Final Appeal). Founded by him, the first theistic church was organized in 1828 at Calcutta, and formally opened in 1830 as the Brahma Samaj ('the Congregation of God'). In doing this he wished it to be understood that he was not founding a new sect, but a pure monotheistic worship. The only creed was a confession of faith in the unity of God. For himself, he abandoned pantheism, adopted
the belief in a, final judgment, in miracles, and in Christ as the
'Founder of true religion.' He died in 1833 in England. His successor, Debendranath Tagore,-' was not appointed leader of the Brahma Samaj till much later ; after he had founded a church of his own (' the Truth-teaching Society '),
which lasted for twenty years (1839-1859), before it was united with the Brahma Samaj. In the meantime Debendra
nath had become a member of the latter society (1841). He established the covenant of the Samaj, a vow taken by every member to lead holy lives, to abstain from idolatry, to worship no created object, but only God, the One without a second,^ the Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, the Giver of Emancipation.

MODERN HINDU SECTS. 517
The church was newly organized in 1844 with a regularly appointed president and minister, and with the administration of the oath to each believer. This is the Adi Brahma Samaj, the First Congregation, in distinction from the schism which soon
took place. The first quarrel in this church was due to a difference of opinion in regard to the authority of the Vedas.
Some members rejected them, others maintained their infallibility ; while between these extremes lay various other opinions, some members questioning the infallibility of the Vedas but maintaining their authority. By a majority vote it was eventually decided that the Vedas (and Upanishads) were not in
fallible.
In the meantime in other provinces rival Samajas had been formed, and by 1850 there were several of these broad-minded Congregations, all trammelled by their environment, but doing
their best to be liberal. We pause here in the compilation of the data recorded in this paragraph to assert, independently of Professor Williams, who has given us the historical facts, but would doubtless not wish to have imputed to himself the following judgment which we are led to pass, that the next step of the Samaj placed it upon the only ground where the objects of this church can be attained, and that in the subsequent reform of this reform, which we shall have to record below, a backward step has been taken. For Debendranath changed the essential character of the Samaj from pantheistic theism to pure deism. The inner circle of the society had a narrower declaration of faith, but in his Brahma Dharma, published about 1850, Debendranath formulated four articles of faith, to subscribe to which admitted any one into the Samaj. These articles read as
follows: (r) Brahma (neuter) alone existed in the beginning
before the universe ; naught else existed ; It [He] created all
the universe. (2) It [He] is eternal, intelligent, infinite, bliss
ful, self-governed (independent), without parts, just one (neuter)



SIS THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
without a second, all-pervading, the ruler (masculine noun) of all, refuge of all, omniscient, omnipotent, immovable, perfect,
without parallel (all these adjectives are neuter). (3) By worship of this One alone can bliss be obtained in the next world
and in this. (4) The worship of this (neuter) One consists in love toward this (One) and in performing works pleasant (to this One). This deism denies an incarnate God, scriptural authority, and the good of rites and penance ; biit it teaches the efficacy
of prayer and repentance, and the belief in God as a personal
Creator and Heavenly Father.^ Intellectual — anything but
emotional — it failed to satisfy many worshippers. And as a church it was conservative in regard to social reforms. In 1858 Keshub Chunder Sen, a Vishnuite by family, then but twenty, joined the Samaj, and being clever, young, eloquent, and cultivated, he, after the manner of the Hindus, undertook to reform the church he had just entered, first of
all by urging the abolition of caste-restrictions. Debendranath
was liberal enough to be willing to dispense with his own thread (the caste-mark), but too wisely conservative to demand
of his co-religionists so complete a break with tradition and
social condition. For the sacred thread to the Hindu is the
sign of social respectability. Without it, he is out of society.
It binds him to all that is dearest to him. The leader of the older Samaj never gave up caste ; the younger members in
1 But, as will be noticed in the four articles (which are in part a compilation of phrases from the Upanishads) the personality of Brahma is not insisted on for the outer church. For this reason, although the inner church doubtless understands It as He, yet this neuter should be preserved in the translation. The articles are so drawn up as to enable any deist to subscribe (without Vedantic belief as a condition of acceptance) to the essential creed of the Congregation. One or two sentences in the original will reveal at a glance the origin of the phraseology : brahma (being) vd ekam idam-agra dsit ; tad idam sarvam asrjat ; tad eva nityam^ ekam evddvittyam ; tasjnin pritis . . , tadupdsanam. Compare Chandogya Upanishad : sad (being) idam-agra dsld ekam evddviityam ; and the Vajasaneyl-Brahxnana Upanishad: brahma vd idam-agra dsU^ etc.



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 519
doing so mix religion with social etiquette, and so hinder the advance they aim at. Sen urged this and other reforms, all repugnant to the society in which he lived, changes in the rite
at the worship 'of ancestors, alterations in the established ritual at birth-ceremonies and funerals, abolition of polyandry and
of child-marriages, and, worst of all, granting permission to
marry to those of different castes. His zeal was directed espe
cially against caste-restrictions and child-marriages. Naturally
he failed to persuade the old Samaj to join him in these revo
lutionary views, to insist on which, however sensible they seem, cannot be regarded otherwise than as indiscreet from the point of view of one who considers men and passions. For the Samaj, in the face of tremendous obstacles, had just secured a foothold in India. Sen's headlong reforms would have smashed to pieces the whole congregation, and left India more deeply prejudiced than ever against free thought. Sen failed to reform the old church, so in 1865 he, with some ardent young enthusiasts, reformed themselves into a new church, ceremoniously organized in 1866 as the Brahma Samaj of India, in distinction from the Calcutta Samaj, or Adi Samaj. A futile effort was made to get all the other local congregations to join the new
Samaj, the last, of course, to be the first and head of the organi
zation. The new Samaj renounced caste-restrictions and Brahmanism
altogether, but it was tainted with the hysterical bhakli fervor which Sen inherited from his childhood's religion, and which (if one may credit Williams' words) " brought the latest development of Indian Theism into closer harmony with Christian ideas." The chief leader of this Samaj besides Sen was his
cousin Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, official secretary of the society. Its literary organ is the Indian Mirror. The reform of this reform of course followed before long. The new Samaj was accused of making religion too much a matter of emotion and excitement. Religious fervor, bhakti,

had led to " rapturous singing of hymns in the streets " ; and to the establishment of a kind of love-feasts (' Brahma-feasts
'
they were called) of prayer and rejoicing ; and, on the other
hand, to undue asceticism and self-mortification.^ Sen him
self was revered too much. One of the most brilliant, eloquent,
and fascinating of men, he was adored by his followers — as a god ! He denied that he had accepted divine honors, but there is no doubt, as Williams insists, that his Vishnuite ten
dency led him to believe himself peculiarly the recipient of
divine favors. It was charged against him that he asserted that all he did was at God's command, and that he believed
himself perennially inspired.^ If one add to this that he was
not only divinely inspired, but that he had the complete control of his society, it would appear to be easy to foresee where the next reformer might strike. For Sen " was not only bishop, priest, and deacon all in one," says Williams, "he was a Pope, from whose decision there was no appeal." But it was
not this that caused the rupture. In 1877 this reformer, "who had denounced early marriages as the curse of India," yielded to natural social ambition and engaged his own young daughter to a Koch (Rajbanshi) prince, who in turn was a mere boy. The Samaj protested with all its might, but the marriage was performed the next year, withal to the accompaniment of idolatrous rites.^ After this Sen became somewhat theatrical. In
1 It is interesting to see this fervor, or ecstatic delirium, surviving from tlie time of the Rig Veda, where already (albeit only in the latest hymns, which are quite Brahmanic) flourishes the mad muni; and fervid asceticism (' heat,' /rt/rtj) begins to appear as a means of salvation. RV. a. 109, 136. 2 " I regard myself as Christ and Caitanya," reported by Sen's own missionary as the words of the former. Sen's disciples deny some of these a^ertions, but they seem to be substantiated, and Sen's own language shows that he claimed miraculous powers. Compare the discussions on tliis point, JRAS. xiii. 2S1 ff. 8 This was afterwards excused on the ground that the marriage would not have been legal without these rites. But Sen presumably was aware of this in advance. From the performance of the rites he had the decency to absent himself. It should be said, however, in Sen's behalf, that the marriage itself had nothing revolting about



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 521
1879 he recognized (in a proclamation) God's Motherhood the old dogma of the female divine. In 1880 he announced,
in fervid language, that Christianity was the only true religion :
" It is Christ who rules British India, and not the British Government. England has sent out a tremendous moral force in the life and character of that mighty prophet to conquer and hold this vast empire. None but Jesus, none but Jesus, none but Jesus, ever deserved this bright, this precious diadem,
India, and Jesus shall have it. . . . Christ is a true Yogi."
He accepts Chtist, but not as God, only as inspired saint (as says Williams). More recently, Sen proposed an amalgamation of Hinduism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity as the
true religion.
Meanwhile the Samaj was rent by discord. Sen's opponents, the new reformers, were unable, however, to oust the brilliant leader from the presidency. Consequently they established a new church, intended to be a General Congregation, the fourth development (1878) of the Brahma Samaj. And so the fight has gone on ever since. At the present day there are more than a hundred deistic churches, in which the devotional exercises consist in part of readings from the Vedas, Bible, Kuran, and Avesta. The Arya Samaj is one of the most important of the later churches, some of which endeavor to obtain unde
filed religion by uniting into one faith what seems best in all
;
others, by returning to the Vedas and clearing them of what they think to be later corruptions of those originally pure scrip
tures. Of the latter sort is the Arya Samaj. Its leader, Daya
nanda, claims that the Vedas are a true revelation. The last reformer of which we have knowledge is a bright young highcaste Hindu of upper India, who is about to found a ' world
it, and though in consenting to it Sen violated his faith, as is evident from the protest of the Samaj, yet was the marriage not an extreme case of child-marriage, for both the ' children ' were sixteen. Sen's own excuse (he thought excuse necessary) was that he was inspired when he consented to the nuptials.



522 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
religion,' for which task he is now making preliminary studies.
He has visited this country, and recently told us that, if he had time, he could easily convert America. But his first duty lies, of course, in the reformation of India's reformations, espe
cially of the Samajas !
The difficulty with which all these reformers and re-reformers have to contend is pitifully clear. Their broad ideas have no iitting environment. Their leaders and thinkers may continue to preach deism, and among their equals they will be heard and understood. They are, however, not content with this. They must form churches. But a church implies in every case an unnatural and therefore dangerous growth, caused by the
union either of inferior minds (attracted by eloquence, but
unable to think) with those that are not on the same plane, or of
ambitious zealots with reluctant conservatists. Many join the
church who are not qualified to appreciate the leader's work. They overload the founder's deism with the sectarian theism from which they have not really freed themselves. On the other hand, younger men, who have been educated in English colleges and are imbued with the spirit of practical reform, enter the
church to use it as an instrument for social progress. So the church is divided, theists and reformers both being at odds with the original deists ; and the founder is lucky if he escapes being deified by one party and being looked upon by the other
as too dull.^
1 The theistic tendency in the Hindu mind is so exaggerated that even now it is with the greatest difficulty that tlie vulgar can be restrained from new idolatry. Not only priests, but even poets are regarded as gods. Jnandev and Tukaram, the hymn-makers of the Mahratta Viththals, are demi-gods to-day (lA. xi. 56. 149). A few striking examples are almost requisite to make an Occidental'reader understand against what odds the deism of India has to contend. In 1830 an impudent boy, who could train snakes, announced that he could also work miracles. The boy was soon accepted as Vishnu's last avatar : liymns, abhangs. were sung to him, and he was worshipped as a god even after his early demise (frttm a snake-bite). A weaver came soon after to the temple, where stood the boy's now vacant slirine, and fell asleep there at night. In tlie morning he was perplexed to find himself a god. The people



MODERN HINDU SECTS. 523
India is no more prepared as a whole for the reception of the liberal views of the Samaj than was the negro for the right to vote. Centuries of higher preliminary education are needed
before the people at large renounce their ancestral, their natural faith. A few earnest men may preach deism ; the people
will remain polytheists and pantheists for many generations. Then, again, the Samajas have to contend not only with the
national predisposition, but with every heretical sect, and,
besides these, with the orthodox church. But thus far their
chief foe is, after all, their own heart as opposed to their head.
As long as deistic leaders are deified by their followers, and
regard themselves as peculiarly inspired, they will preach in vain. Nor can they with impunity favor the substitution of emotion for ideas in a land where religious emotion leads
downwards as surely as falls a stone that is thrown.
had accepted him as their snake-conquering god in a new form. The poor weaver denied liis divinity, but that made no difference. In 1834 the dead boy-god was still receiving flowers and prayers. Another case : In the eighties some Englishmen on entering a temple were amazed to see revered as an avatar of Vishnu the brass castings of the arms of the old India Co. This god was washed and anointed daily. Even a statue of Buddha (with the inscription still upon it) was revered as Vishnu. In 18S0 a meteorite fell in Behar. In 1882 its cult was fully established, and it was worshipped as the 'miraculous god.' A Mohammedan inscription has also been found deified and regularly worshipped as a god.

CHAPTER XVIII.
RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES.
Besides the phases of pure Aryan and modified Aryan re
ligions wliicli have already been examined, there are repre
sented in India several other aspects of civilized religion ; for,
apart from Brahmanic and sectarian worships, and apart from Tamil (southern) imitations of these, there are at present in
the country believers of the Jewish religion to the number of seventeen thousand ; of Zoroastrianism, eighty-seven thousand ;
of Christianity, two and a quarter millions ; of Mohammedan
ism, more than fifty-seven millions. But none of these faiths,
however popular, comes into an historical account of India's religions in a greater extent than we have brought them into it
already, that is, as factors of minor influence in the development
of native faitlis till, within the last few centuries, Mohammedanism, which has been the most important of them all in transfiguring the native theistic sects, draws a broad line across the
progress of India's religious thought.
All these religions, however, whether aboriginal or imported, must again be separated from the more general phenomena of
superstition which are preserved in the beliefs of the native
wild tribes. One descends here to that lowest of rank under
growth which represents a type of religious life so base that its undifferentiated form can be mated with like growths from all
over the world. These secondary religions are, therefore, im
portant from two points of view, that of their universal aspect)
^ and, again, that of their historical connection with the uppei: Indie growth above them;^ for it is almost certain that some
1 The Dasyus, heathen, or pagans, are by no means a wholly uncivilized mass to the poets of the Rig Veda. They have wealth, build forts, and are recognized as



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. S2S
of their features have conditioned the development of the
latter.
The native wild tribes of India (excluding the extreme North
ern Tibeto-Burman group) fall into two great classes, that
of the Kolarians and that of the Dravidians, sometimes distin
guished as the Yellow and the Black races respectively. The
former, again, are called Indo-Chinese by some writers, and the geographical location of this class seems, indeed, to show
that they have generally displaced the earlier blacks, and represent historically a yellow wave of immigration from the Northeast (through Tibet) prior to the Aryan white wave (from the Northwest), which latter eventually treated them just as they had treated the aboriginal black Dravidians.^ Of the Kolarians the foremost representatives are the Koles, the Koches, the Sunthals, and the Savaras (Sauras), who are all regarded by Johnston as the yellow Dasyus, barbarians, of the earliest
period ; while he sees in the 'Vai9yas, or third caste of the
Hindu political divisions, the result of a union of the Northwest and Northeast conquerors. But, although the Vaigyas are called 'yellow,' yet, since they make the most important numerical factor of the Aryans, this suggestion can scarcely be accepted, for there is no evidence to show that the yellow Mongoloid barbarians were amalgamated so early with the body politic of the Aryans. The chief representatives of the Dra
living in towns or forts. We learn little about them in Brahmanic literature, except that they bury their dead and with them their trinkets. Their graves and dolmen grave-stones are still found. 1 Some scholars think that the Dravidians entered from the Northwest later than the Kolai-ians, and, pushing them to either side of the peninsula, descended through them to the South. The fact that some Kolarian tribes closely related by language are separated (to East and West) by hundreds of miles, and have lost all remembrance of their former union, favors this view of a Dravidian wedge splitting and passing through the Kolarian mass. But all here is guess-work. The Dravidians may have been pushed on by Kolarians that entered later, while the latter may have been split by the Aryan invasion ; and this seems to us more probable, because the other theory does not explain why the Kolarians did not go South instead of taking to the hills of the East and West.



526 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
vidians, on the other hand, are tlie Khonds and Gonds of the middle of the peninsula, together with the Oraons and the.
Todas of the extreme South. ^ All of these tribes are of course
sub-divided, and in some degree their religious practices have
followed the bent of their political inclinations. We shall ex
amine first the religions of the older tribes, the Dravidians,
selecting the chief features or such traits as have peculiar
interest.
THE DRAVIDIANS.
Gonds : These savages, mentioned in early literature, are the most numerous and powerful of the wild tribes, and appear to have been less affected by outside belief than were any other,
except the related Khonds. Their religion used to consist in
adoring a representation of the sun, to which were offered human sacrifices.^ As among the Oraons, a man of straw (literally) is at the present day substituted for the human victim.
Besides the sun, the moon and stars are worshipped by them. They have stones for idols, but no temples.^ Devils, witch
. craft, and the evil eye also are feared. They sacrifice animals,
^
1 The whole Ust of these' tribes as given by Cust, Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies^ is as follows : The Kolarians include the Sunthals, Mundari Koles (Koches), Kharians, Juangs, Korwas, Kurs, Savaras, Mehtos, Gadabas, Paharias^; the Dravidians include the tribes called Tamil, Telugu, Kanarese, Mayayalim, Tulu,
, Kudagu, Toda, Kota, Khond, Gond, Oraon, Rajmahali, Keikadi, Yerukala.
\
2 The sacrifices of the wild tribes all appear to have the object of pleasing or placating the god with food, animal or vegetable ; just as the Brahmanic sacrifice is made to please, with the secondary thought that the god will return the favor with interest ; then that he is bound to do so. Sin is carried away by the sacrifice, but this seems to be merely an extension of the simpler idea ; the god condones a fault after an expression of repentance and good-will. What lies further back is not revealed in the early texts, though it is easy to make them fruitful in " theories of sacrifice." 3 Of course no tribe has what civilization would call a temple, but some have what answer to it, namely, a filthy hut where live the god and his priest. Yet the Gonds used to build roads and irrigate very well.



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 527
and, with the exception of the Raj Gonds/ hive been so little
affected by Hindu respect for that holiest of animals, that they
slaughter cows at their wedding-feasts, on which occasion the bacchanalian revels in which they indulge are accompanied with such excess as quite to put them upon the level of ^ivaite bestiality. The pure Gonds are junglemen, and have the virtues usually found among the lowest savages, truth, honesty,
and courage. Murder is no crime, but lying and stealing are
sinful ; for cowardice is the greatest crime, and lying and stealing (instead of straightforward and courageous robbery and murder) are regarded as indications of lack of courage. But the ' impure,' that is the mixed Gonds that have been corrupted by mingling with Hindus and other tribes, lie and steal like
civilized people. In fact, the mixed Gonds are particularly
noted for servility and dishonesty. The uncivilized Gonds of^
the table-lands are said still to cut up and eat their aged relatives and friends, not to speak of strangers unfortunate enough to fall into their hands. Among the pure Gonds is found the
practice of carrying an axe, which is the sign of their religious
devotion to the sacrifice-god.'' The favorite religious practice
used to be to take a prisoner ulive, force him to bow before the god-stone, and, at the moment when he bent his head, to
cut it off. To this and to self-defence against other gods (wild
beasts) the hatchet is devoted, while for war are used the bow^ and knife. One particular celebration of the Gonds deserves special notice. They have an annual feast and worship of the^
snake. The service is entirely secret, and all that is known
1 The (Raj) Gonds were first subdued by the Rajputs, and where the Hindus and Gonds have intermarried they are known as Raj Gonds. Others have become the ' Mohammedan Gonds.' Otherwise, in the case of the pure or ' Assul ' (the greater number), neither Hindu nor Mohammedan has had much influence over them, either socially or religiously. The Gonds whipped the British in 1818 ; but since then they have become ' pacified.' 2 It is often no more than a small hatchet stuck in the belt, if they wear the latter, which in the jungle is more raiment than they .ire wont to put on.



S28 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
of it is that it is of esoteric, perhaps phallic character. Both
at the sun-feast and snake-feast^ licentious and bacchanalian
worship are combined, and the latter trait is also the chief
feature of wedding and funeral sports. In the former case
(the natives of the same tribe intermarry, but with the same pretence of running off with the bride that is found in the
Hindu ritual)^ there is given a wedding feast by the bride
groom's father, and the feast ends_ with a causerie de lundi (the
favorite drink of the Gonds is called lundi) ; while on the latter occasion there is a mourning feast, or wake, which also ends in general drunkenness.
The Khonds : Even more striking is the religion of the
Khonds. Their chief rite is human sacrifice to the earth-goddess,^ Tari ; but, like the Gonds, they worship the sun as chief divinity. Other gods among them are the river-god,
rain-god, spring, wealth, hill-god, and smallpox-god. All their religious feasts are excuses for excess both in drinking and
otherwise. One of their beliefs is that there is a river of hell,
which flows around a slippery rock, up which climbs the one that would escape torment. Their method of sacrificing a
human victim is to put him into the cleft of a tree, where he is squashed, or into fire. They seem to have an odd objection to shedding blood for this purpose, and in this respect may be compared with the Thugs. Another very interesting trait is
the religion which is intertwined with business, and its peculiar
features. Victims offered either to the sun or to the war-god serve to mark boundary lines. Great is the patience with which
1 The snake in the tree is common to many tribes, both being tutelary. The Gonds are ' sons of the forest trees,' and of the northern bull. 2 It seems to us that this feature need not be reckoned as a sign of exogamy. It is often, so far as we have observed, only a stereotyped form to express bashfulness. 3 Some say earth-^o^/. Thus the account given in JRAS. 1842, p. 172, says ' male earth-god as ancestor,' but most modern writers describe the divinity as a female. Some of the Khonds worship only earth (as a peacock). This is the peacock revered at the Pongol ?



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 529
these victims, called merias, are waited for. The sacrificer captures fit specimens when they are young, and treats them with particular kindness till they are almost grown up. Indeed, they are treated thus by the whole village. At the appointed time they are slowly crushed to death or smothered in a mud bath, and bits of their flesh are then cut out and strewn along the
boundary lines. Boys are preferred, but either boys or girls
may be used. This sacrifice is sometimes made directly to the ' Boundary-god,' -^ an abstraction which is not unique ; for, besides the divinities recorded above, mention is made also of a
' Judgment-god.' Over each village and house preside the Manes of good men gone ; while the ' father is god on earth
'
to every one. They used to destroy all their female children, and this, together with their national custom of offering human
sacrifices, has been put down with the greatest difiTiculty by
the British, who confess that there is every probability that in reality the crime still obtains among the remoter clans. These
Khonds are situate in the Madras presidency, and are aborigines of the Eastern Ghats. The most extraordinary views about them have been published. Despite their acknowledged barbarity, savageness, and polytheism, they have been soberly credited with a belief in One Supreme God, ' a theism embracing polytheism,' and other notions which have been abstracted from their worship of the sun as ' great god.'
Since these are by far the most original savages of India, a completer sketch than will be necessary in the case of others may not be unwelcome. The chief god is the light- or sungod. " In the beginning the god of light created a wife, the goddess of earth, the source of evil." On the other hand, the
1 The Gonds also have a boundary-god. Graves as boundaries are known among the Anglo-Saxons. Possibly Hermes as boundary-god may be connected with the Hermes that conducts souls; oris it simply as thief-god that he guards from theft? The Khond practice would indicate that the corpse {as something sacred) made the boundary, not that the boundary was made by running a line to a barrow, as is the case in the Anglo-Saxon connection between barrow and bound.



530 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sun-god is a good god. Tari, the earth-divinity, tried to pre
vent Bella' Pennu (sun-god) from creating man. But he cast behind him a handful of earth, which became man. The first creation was free of evil ; earth gave fruit without labor (the
Golden Age) ; but the dark goddess sowed in man the seed of sin. A few were sinless still, and these became gods, but the corrupt
no longer found favor in Bella (or Boora) Pennu's eyes. He guarded them no more. So death came to man. Meanwhile Bella and Tari contended for superiority, with comets, whirl
winds, and mountains, as weapons. According to one behef, Bella won ; but others hold that Tari still maintains the struggle.
The sun-god created, all inferior deities, of rain, fruit, hunt,
boundaries, etc., as well as all tutelary local divinities.^ Men
have four kinds of fates. The soul goes to the sun, or re
mains in the tribe (each child is declared by the priest to be
N. N. deceased and returned), or is re-born and suffers punishments, oris annihilated.' The god of judgment lives on Grippa Valli, the 'leaping rock,' round which flows a black river, and up the rock climb the souls with great effort. The Judgment
1 Some may compare Bellerophon ! , 2 Xutelary deities are of house, village, groves, etc. The 'House-god' is, of course, older than this or than Hinduism. The Rig Veda recognizes Vastoshpati, the ' Lord of the House,' to whom the law (Manu, iii. 8g, etc.) orders oblations to be made. But Hinduism prefers a female house-goddess (see above, p. 374). Windisch connects this Vedic divinity, Vastos-pati, with Vesta and Hestia. The same scholar compares Keltic vassus, vassallus, originally ' house-man 'j and very ingeniously
equates Vassorix with Vedic vasdiii raja = vi^dm raja, 'king of the house-men
'
(clan), like hiiskarlar^ 'house-fellows,' in Scandinavian (domesticus, oU^Tyji). Win

3 That is to say, a dead man's spirit goes to heaven, or is re-born whole in the tribe, or is re-born diseased (anywhere, this is penal discipline), or finally is annihilated. Justly may one compare the Brahmanic division of the Manes into several classes, according to their destination as conditioned by their manner of living and exit from life. It is the same idea ramifying a little differently j not a case of borrowing, but the growth of two similar seeds. On the other hand, the un-Aryan doctrine of transmigration may be due to the belief of native wild tribes. It appears first in the Qatapatha, but is hinted at in the ' plant-souls ' of the RV. (above, pp. 145, 204, 432), possibly in RV. i. 164. 30, 38 ; Botlingk, loc. cit., 1893, p. 88.



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 531
god decides the fate of the soul, sending it to the sun (the
sun-soul), or annihilating it, etc. The chief sins are, to be in
hospitable, to break an oath, to lie except to save a guest, to
break an old custom, to commit incest, to contract debts (for
which the tribe has to pay), to be a coward, to betray council.
The chief virtues are, to kill in battle, to die in battle, to be a
priest, to be the victim of a sacrifice. Some of the Khonds wo:^
ship the sun-god ; some the earth-goddess, and ascribe to her
all success and power, while they hold particularly to human
sacrifice in her honor. They admit (theoretically) that Bella
is superior, but they make Tari the chief object of devotion,
and in her honor are held great village festivals. They that do not worship Tari do not practice human sacrifice. Thus the Qivaite sacrifice of man to the god's consort is very well, paralleled by the usage that obtains among them. The Khond priests may indulge in any occupation except war ; but some
exercise only their priestcraft and do nothing else. The chief feast to the sun-god is Salo Kallo (the former word means
'cow-pen'; the latter, a liquor), somewhat like a j^OTa-feast.
It is celebrated at harvest time with dancing, and drinking,
" and every kind of licentious enjoyment." Other festivals of
less importance celebrate the substitution of a buffalo fcr
human sacrifice (not celebrated, of course, by the Tari wor
shippers). The invocation at the harvest is quite Brahmanic : " O gods, remember that our increase of rice is your increase
of wor'ship ; if we get little rice we worship little." Among
lesser gods the ' Fountain-god ' is especially worshipped, with a
sheep or a hog as sacrifice. Female infanticide springs from
a feeling that intermarriage in the same tribe is incest (this is the meaning of the incest-law above ; it might be rendered ' to
marry in the tribe '). Of the Oraons, or Dhangars,^ we shall mention but one or
1 This tribe now divides with.tlie Lurica Koles the possession of Chota Nagpur, which the latter tribe used to command entire. The Oraons regard the Lurka Koles



532 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
two good parallels to what is found in otKer religions. These Dravidians live in Bengal, and have two annual festivals, a harvest feast and one celebrating the marriage of heaven and earth. Like the Khonds, they recognize a supreme god in the sun, but, just as we showed was the case with the Hindus, who ignore Brahma because they do not fear him, so here, the Oraons do not pray to the sun, on the ground that he does them no harm ; but they sacrifice to evil spirits because the
latter are evil-doers. These savages, like the Burmese Mish
"tnis, have no idea of a future life in heaven ; but in the case
of people killed in a certain way they believe in a sort of metempsychosis ; thus, for instance, a man eaten by a tiger becomes a tiger. In the case of unfortunates they believe that they will live as unhappy ghosts ; in the case of other men
they assume only annihilation as their fate.^ It is among this tribe that the mouse-totem is found, which is Qiva's beast and the sign of Ganega.^
THE KOLARIANS.
The Sunthals : These are immigrants ipto the West Bengal jungles, and have descended from the North to their present site. They are called the finest specimens of the native savage. The guardian of the tribe is its deceased ancestor, and his ghost is consulted as an oracle. Their race-god is the ' Great Mountain,' but the sun represents the highest spirit; though they
as inferiors. Compare JRAS. iS6i, p. 370 ff. They are sometimes erroneously grouped with the Koles, ethnographically as well as geographically. Risley, Tribes and Castes of Bengal^ p. xxxii. 1 Something like this is recorded by Brinton, Myths of the New World, p. 243, as the belief of an American tribe, "which holds that the fate of the dead depends on the manner of death, the funeral rites, or " some such arbitrary circumstance " (as in Greece). 2 Compare the epic * Mouse-people,' Miishikas, as well as Apollo's mouse. Possi' bly another Hindu mark of sectarianism may be traced to the wild tribes, the use of - vermilion markings. This is the most important »element in the Bengal wedding rite (Risley).



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 533
worship spirits of every sort, and regard beasts as divine ; the men revering the tiger, and the women, elephants. The par
ticularly nasty festival called the bandana, which is celebrated
annually by this tribe, is exactly like the ' left-hand ' cult of the
Qaktas, only that in this case it is a preliminary to marriage. All unmarried men and women indulge together in an indescribable orgie, at the end of which each man selects the woman
he prefers.*
The Koles (' pig-stickers ') : Like the last, this tribe worship
the sun, but with the moon as his wife, and the stars as their
children. Besides these they revere Manes, and countless local and sylvan deities. Like Druids, they sacrifice only in a grove, but without images.^ All these tribes worship snakes and trees,^ and often the only oath binding upon them is taken under a tree.* The
1 Above the Sunthals, who inhabit the jungle and lower slopes of the Rajmahal hills, live the Paharlas, who never tell a lie (it is said), and whose religion in some aspects is worth noticing. They believe in one god (over each village god), who created seven brothers to rule earth. The Paharias descend from the eldest of these brothers. They believe in transmigration, a future state, and oracles. But it is questionable whether they have not been exposed to Buddhistic influence, as ' Budo Gosain' is the name of the supreme (sun-)god. 2 In the ninth century Orissa was formed of the territories of Khonds, Koles, and Savaras. In the old grouping of tribes these, together with the Gonds and Bhils, were the " five children of the soil " between the Vindhya mountains, the east chain of the Ghats, and the mouth of the Godavari to the centre of the valley of the Nerbudda. The last mentioned tribe of Bhils (Bheels) is almost devoid of native religion, but is particularly noted for truth, honesty, and fidelity. JRAS. 1844, pp. 181, 189, 192; 1852, p. 216 ff. It is an ancient race, but its origin is not certain. 8 Trees are revered by the Brahmans also, as by the American Indians. Schoolcraft, i, 368. The tree-spirit is an advance on this (Brahmanic and Hinduistic). * Thus the Bhils' wedding is simply a mutual promise under the singd tree. These savages, however, live together only so long as they choose. When the family separates, the father takes the elder children, and the mother takes the younger ones. They are polygamous. It is from this tribe that the worship of Aghorl, thS^^ Vindhya fiend, accepted as a form of Kali, was introduced into Qivaite worship. At present their religion is a mixture of Hindu and native superstition. Thus, hke the Gonds, they worship stone images of gods placed in a circle, but they recognize^
among these gods several of the Hindu divinities. '^



534 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
sun-worship, which is found alike in Kolarian and Dravidian
tribes, may be traced through all the ramifications of either.
In most of the tribes the only form of worship is sacrifice, but
oaths are taken on rice, beasts, ants, water, earth, etc. (among some Pahariahs on the arrow). Some have a sort of belief in
the divinity of the chief, and among the Lurka Koles this
dignity is of so much importance that at a chief's death the
divine dignity goes to his eldest son, while the youngest son
gets the property. In regard to funeral rites, the Koles first burn and then bury the remains, placing a stone over the
grave. Besides the Oraons' totem of the mouse, the Sunthals have a goose-totem, and the Garos and Kassos (perhaps not to be included in either of the two groups), together with many other
tribes, have totems, some of them avatars., as in the case of the tortoise. The Garos, a tribe between Assam and Bengal, are in many respects noteworthy. They believe that their vessels are immortal ; and, like the Bhars, set up the bamboo
pole, a religious rite which has crept into Hinduism (above, p. 378). They eat everything but their totem, immolate human victims, and are divided into 'motherhoods,' Maharis,
particular Maharis intermarrying. A man's sister marries into the family from which comes his wife, and that sister's daughter
may marry his son, and, as male heirs do not inherit, the son
in-law succeeds his father-in-law in right of his wife, and gets

wedding is that of a cock and lien, offered to the sun. The god they worship most is a monster (very much like Qiva), but he has no local habitation. •
Of the Savaras or Sauras of the Dekhan the most interestingV deity is the malevolent female called Thakurani, wife of Thakur.
She was doubtless the first patroness of the throttling Thugs
{thags are tkaks, assassins), and the prototype of their Hindu
Kali. Human sacrifices are offered to Thakurani, while her
vota,ri2s, as in the case of the Thugs, are noted for the secrecy^ of their crimes. '
Birth-rites, marriage-rites, funeral rites (all of blood), humavN
sacrifice, fabii (especially among the Burmese), witchcraft, wor
ship of ancestors, divination, and demonology are almost uni
versal throughout the wild tribes. In most of the rites the
holy stone ^ plays an important part, and in many of the tribes/
dmces are a religious exercise. ' Descendants of the great Serpent-race that once ruled Magadha (Behar), the Bhars, and Chirus (Cheeroos) are historically of the greatest importance, though now but minor tribes of Bengal. The Bhars, and Koles, and Chirus may once have formed one body, and, at any rate, like the last, the Bhars are Kolarian and not Dravidian. This is not the place to argue a thesis which might well be supported at length, but in view of the sudden admixture of foreign elements with the Brahmanism that begins to expand at the end of the Vedic period it is almost imperative to raise the question whether the Bhars, of
all the northern wild tribes the most cultivated, whose habitat
1 The marriage-stone, as in the Hindu rite, is quite common. Of lesser superstitions the iabil, analogous to the avoidance of unlucky names among the Hindus, may be mentioned. Friendship among girls is cemented by a religious ceremony. After this, among the Oraons, the two avoid each other's name, caUing each other only ' my flower' or 'my meet-to-smile' (Rowney). In this tribe exogamy is 'more respectable,' but not necessary. The girls are generally bought, and have fixed prices, but we have seen the customary price (twenty-five pigs) cited only for Assam among the Meeris. If one man cannot pay so much, several unite, for polyandry prevails all through the northern tribes (JRAS. xi. 38), and even in the Punjab.

extended from Oude (Gorakhpur) on both sides' of the Ganges over all the district between Benares and Allahabad, and whose name is found in the form Bharats as well as Bhars, is not one
with that great tribe the history of whose war has been handed down to us in a distorted form under the name of Bharata (Mahabharata). The Bharatas, indeed, claim to be Aryans. But is it likely that a race would have come' from the Northeast and another from the Northwest, and both have the same name ? Carnegy believed, so striking was the coincidence, that the Bharats were a Rajput (Hindu) tribe that had become barbaric. But against this speaks the type, which is not Aryan but Kolarian.^ Some influence one may suppose to have come from the more intelligent tribes, and to have worked on Hindu
belief. We believe traces of it may still be found in the classics. For instance, the famous Frog-maiden, whose tale is told in the Mahabharata, reminds one rather forcibly of the fact that in Oude and Nepal frog-worship (not as totem) was an established cult. The time for this worship to begin is October ; it
is different to thunder-worship (July, the ndga-ie.'asX), and the frog is subordinate to the snake. And, again, the snake-wor
ship that grows so rapidly into the Hindu cult can scarcely have been uninfluenced by the fact that there are no less than
thirty snake-tribesi^)
But despite some interesting points of view besides those
1 Sherring (JRAS. v. 376) says decidedly that Bhars, or Bharats, and Chlrus cannot be Aryans. This article is one full of interesting details in regard to the high cultivation of the Bharat tribe. They built large stone forts, immense subterranean caverns, and made enormous bricks for tanks and fortifications (19X11X2^ inches), the former being built regularly to east and west {surajbcdi). One of their chief cities lay five miles west of Mirzapur, and covered several miles, entirely surrounding the Puranic city of Vindhyacal, built in the midst of it. Six or seven hundred years ago the Bhais held Oude and Benares. Carnegy's opinion is given in his Races, Tribes, and Castes of the Pm'ince of Oude (Oudh). The Bhars, says Elliot, Chronicles of Oonayo, built all the towns not ending in pur, mow, or dbdd (Hindu, Mongol, Mohammedan). Their sacra (totems?) are the bamboo, bcl-tree, tortoise, and peacock. 2 JRAS. xii. 229 ; lA. xxii. 293.



RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 537
touched upon here, details are of little added value, since it
is manifest that, whether Kolarian or Dravidian, or, for the
matter of that, American or African, the same rites will obtain with the same superstition, for they belong to every land, to the Aryan ancestor of the Hindu as well as to the Hindu him
self. Even totemism as a survival may be suspected in the ~
' fish ' and ' dog ' people of the Rig Veda, as has recently been suggested by Oldenberg. In the Northeast of India many tribes ' worship only mountains, rivers, arid Manes, again a trait both Vedic and Hinduistic, but not necessarily borrowed. Some cf these tribes, like the Khasias of Oude, may be of Rajput descent (the Khasas of Manu, x. 22), but it is more likely that more tribes claim this descent than possess it. We omit many of the tribal customs lest one think they are not original ; for example, the symbol of the cross among the Abors, who worship only diseases, and whose symbol is also found among the American Indians ; the sun-worship of the Katties, who may have been influenced by Hinduism ; together with the cult of Burmese tribes too overspread with Buddhism. But often there is a parallel so surprising as to make it certain that there has been influence. The Niadis (of the South), for example, wor^
ship only the female principle. Many other tribes worship (akti almost exclusively. The Todas worship stone images, buffaloes, and even cow-bells, but they have a celibate priesthood ! We
do not hesitate to express our own belief that the (ra/^/z'-wor
ship is native and drawn from similar cults,! and that the celibate priesthood, on the other hand, is taken from civiliza^
tion. Such a fate appears to have happened in modern times to several deities, now half Brahmanized. For example, Vetala (worshipped in many places) is said in the Dekhan to be an avatar, or, properly speaking, a manifestation of Qiva. What is he in reality ? A native wild god, without a temple, wor
shipped in the open air under the shade of a tree, and in an

enclosure of stones. Just such a deity, in other words, as we have shown is worshipped in just such a way by the wild tribes. A monolith' in the middle of twelve stones represents this
primitive Druidic deity. The stones are painted red in flameshape for a certain distance from the ground, with the upper portion painted white. Apparently there is here a sun-god of
the aborigines. He is worshipped in sickness, as is Qiva, and
propitiated with the sacrifice of a cock, without the interven
tion of any priest. The cock to Aesculapius (" huic gallinae imtnolabantur") may have had the same function originally, for
the cock is always the sun-bird. Seldom is Vetala personified. When he has an image (and in the North he sometimes has temples) it is that of an armless and legless man ; but again
he is occasionally represented as a giant ' perfect in all his
parts.' ^ To the Brahman, Vetala is still a mere fiend, and pre
sides over fiends ; nor will they admit that the red on his stones means aught but blood. In such a god, one has a clue to'' the gradual intrusion of Qiva himself into Brahmanic worship. At
first a mountain lightning fiend, then identified with Rudra, a recognized deity, then made anthropomorphic. There are,
especially in the South, a host of minor Hindu deities, halfacknowledged, all more or less of a fiendish nature in the eyes of the orthodox or even of the Qivaite. Seen through such eyes they are no longer recognizable, but doubtless in many instances they represent a crude form of nature-worship or demonology, which has been taken from the cult of the wild
1 Among the southern Koders the dolmen form grave-stones ; perhaps the rehgious employment of them in this wise led to the idea of the god-stone in many cases ; but it is difficult to say in monolith-worship whether the stone itself be not a god ; not a fetish, for (as has been said by others) a fetish is a god only so long as he is regarded as being useful, and when shown to be useless he is flung away ; but a god-stone is always divine, whether it grants prayers or not. 2 Wilson's note to Stevenson's description, JRAS. 183S, p. 197. The epic diseasegods are not unique. The only god known to the Andaman Islanders (Bay of Bengal) was a disease-devil, and this is found as a subordinate deity in many of the wild tribes.

tribes, and is now more or less thoroughly engrafted upon that of their civilized neighbors.'
One of the most interesting, though not remarkable, cases of similarity between savage and civilized religions is found in the worship of snakes and trees. ^ In the Naga or dragon
form the latter cult may have been aided by the dragon-worshipping barbarians in the period of the northern conquest. But in essentials not only is the snake and dragon worship of the wild tribes one with that of Hinduism, but, as has been
seen, the latter has a root in the cult of Brahmanism also, and
this in that of the Rig Veda itself. The poisonous snake is feared, but his beautiful wave-like motion and the waterhabitat of many of the species cause him to be associated as a divinity with Varuna, the water-god. Thus in early Hinduism
one finds snake-sacrifices of two sorts. One is to cause the
extirpation of snakes, one is to propitiate them. Apart from
the real snake, there is revered also the Naga, a beautiful chi
merical creature, human, divine, and snake-like all in one. These are worshipped by sectaries and by many wild tribes
alike. The Naga tribe of Chota Na^pur, for instance, not
only had three snakes as its battle-ensign, but built a serpenttemple.^
1 In the current Indian Antiquary there is an exceedingly interesting series -of papers by the late Judge Burnell on Devil-worship, with illustrations that show well the character of these lower objects of worship. - The standard work on this subject is Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship, which abounds in interesting facts and dangerously captivating fancies. 3 JRAS. 1S46, p. 407. The ensign here may be totemistic. In Hinduism the epic shows that the standards of battle were often surmounted with signa and effigies of various animals, as was the case, for example, in ancient Germany. We have collected the material on this point in -a. paper in JAOS. xiii. 244. It appears that on top of the flag-staff images were placed. One of these is the Ape-standard; another, the Bull-standard ; another, the Boar-standard. Arjuna's sign was the Ape (with a.lion's tail) ; other heroes had peacocks, elephants, and fabulous monsters like the ^arablia. The Ape is of course the god Hanuman ; the Boar, Vishnu ; the Bull, Qiva ; so that they have a religious bearing for the most part, and are not totemistic. Some are purely fanciful, a bow, a swan with bells, a lily ; or, again, they are signifi



540 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
Tree, and plant worship is quite as antique as is snake-worship. For not only is soma a divine plant, and not only does
Yama sit in heaven under his 'fair tree' (above, p. 129), but
' trees and plants ' are the direct object of invocation in the Rig Veda (v. 41. 8); and the Brahmanic law enjoins upon the
faithful to fling an offering, ball, to the great gods, to the
waters, and 'to the trees';-^ as is the case in the house-ritual.
We shall seek, therefore, for the origin of tree-worship not in
the character of the tree, but in that of the primitive mind
which deifies mountains, waters, and trees, irrespective of their
nature. It is true, however, that the greater veneration due to
some trees and plants has a special reason. Thus soma intoxi
cates : and jthe tulasi, 'holy basil,' has medicinal properties,
which make it sacred not only in the Krishna-cult, but in Sicily.'^
This plant is a goddess, .and is wed annually to the Qalagrama
stone with a great feast.^ So the ^ami plant is herself divine, the goddess Qami. Again, the mysterious rustle of the bo tree,.
pipal, may be the reason for its especial veneration ; as its seeming immortality is certainly the cause of the reverence given to the' banian. It is not necessary, however, that any mystery should hang about a tree. The palm is tall, (Qiva's)
a^oka is beautiful, and no trees are more revered. But trees
are \\o\y per se. Every ' village-tree ' (above, p. 374, and Mbha.
ii. 5. 100) is sacred to the Hindu. And this is just what is found among the wild tribes, who revere their hut-trees and
village-trees as divine, without demanding a special show of
divinity. The birth-tree (as in Grecian mythology) is also
known, both to Hindu sect and to wild tribe. But here also
cant of the heroe's origin (Drona's ' pot '). Trees and flowers are used as standards just like beasts. Especially is the palm a favorite emblem. These signa are in addition to the battle-flags (one of which is blue, carried with an ensign of five stars). On the plants compare Williams. BraJimanisvi and Hinduism, p. 33S. 1 Apastamba, 2. 2. 3. 22 ; Manu. iii. 8S.

RELIGIOUS TRAITS OF THE WILD TRIBES. 541
there is no basis of Aryan ideas, but of common human experience. The ancestor-tree (totem) has been noticed above in the case of the Gonds, who claim descent from trees. The
Bhars rever; the (Qivaite !) bilva or bel, but this is a medicinal
tree. The marriage-tree is universal in the South (the tree is the male or female ancestor), and even the Brahmanic wed
ding, among its secondary after-rites, is not without the tree, which is adorned as part of the ceremony. Two points of view remain to be taken before The wild tribes are dismissed. The first is that Hindu law is primitive. Maine and Leist both cite laws as if any Hindu law were an oracle of primitive Aryan belief. This method is ripe in wrong con
clusions. Most of the matter is legal, but enough grazes religion to make the point important. Even with the sketch we have given it becomes evident that Hindu law cannot be unreservedly taken as an exponent of early Brahmanic law, still less of Aryan law. For instance, Maine regards matriarchy as a late Brahmanic intrusion on patriarchy, an inner growth.' To prove this, he cites two late books, one being Vishnu, the Hindu law-giver of the South. But it is from the Southern wild tribes that matriarchy has crept into Hinduism, and thence into Brahmanism. Here prevails the matriarchal marriage-rite,
with the first espousal to the stjake-guarded tree that repre
sents the mother's family. In many cases geographical limitations of this sort preclude the idea that the custom or law of a law-book is Aryan.
^
1 Early Law and Custom^ p. yi, ff. 2 Thus it is common Aryan law that, on the birth of a child, the mother becomes impure for ten days, either alone or with the father. But the latter's impurity is only nominal, and is removed by bathing (Manu, v. 62, and others). Baudhayana alone states that "according to some" only the father becomes impure (i. 5. 11. 21). This is the custom of a land described by ApoUonius Rhodius (ii. loio), " where, when women bear children, the men groan, go to bed, and tie up the head ; but the women care for them." Yet Baudhayana is a Southerner and a late writer. The custom is legalized only in this writer's laws. Hence it cannot be cited as Brahmanic or even as Aryan law. It was probably the custom of the Southern half-Hinduized environment.



S42 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
The second point of view is that of (the Akkadists. It is
claimed by the late Lacouperie, by Hewitt, and by other well
known writers that a primitive race overran India, China, and the
rest of the world, leaving behind it traces of advanced religious
ideas and other marks of a higher civilization. Such a cult may
have existed, but in so far as this theory rests, as in a marked
degree it does rest, on etymology, the results are worthless. These scholars identify Gandharva with Gan-Eden, Kagi (Benares) with the land of the sons of Kush ; Gautama with Chinese
(' Akkadian ') ^«/, 'a bull,' etc. All this is as fruitful of unwisdom as was the guess-work of European savants two centuries ago. We know that the Dasyus had some religion and some civilization. Of what sort was their barbaric cult, whether
Finnish (also ' Akkadian ') ' or aboriginal with themselves, really
makes but little difference, so far as the interpretation of Aryanism is concerned ; for what the Aryans got from the wild tribes
of that day is insignificant if established as existent at all. A
few legends, the Deluge and the Cosmic Tree, are claimed as Akkadian, but it is remarkable that one may grant all that the Akkadian scholars claim, and still deny that Aryan belief has
been essentially affected by it.^ The Akkadian theory will
please them that cannot reconcile the Rig Veda with their theory
of Brahmanic influence, but the fault lies with the theory.

CHAPTER XIX.
INDIA AND THE WEST.
If in Hinduism, and even in Brahmanism, there are certain traits which, with some verisimilitude, may be referred to the
immediate environment of these religions, how stands it in
respect of that wider circle of influence which is represented by the peoples of the West ? With Egypt and Phoenicia, India had intercourse at an early date, but this appears to have been
restricted to mercantile exchange ; for India till very late was
affected neither by the literature nor by the religion of Egyp
tians or Syrians.^ Of a more direct sort seem to have been the relations between India and Babylon, and the former may owe
to the latter her later astronomy, but no definitive proof exists
(or even any great historical probability) that Babylon gave
India even legendary additions to her native wealth of myths.^ From the Iranians the Hindus parted too early to receive from Zoroastrianism any influence. On the contrary, in our opinion the religion of Zoroaster budded from a branch taken from Indie soil. Even where Persian influence may, with propriety, be suspected, in the later Indie worship of the
sun, India took no new religion from Persia ; but it is very possible that her own antique and preserved heliolatry was

Other doubtful equivalents are discussed by Weber, Ijldische Skizzen, p. 74. 2 The legend of the Flood and the fancy of the Four Ages has been attributed to Babylon by some writers. Ecstein claims Chaldean influence in Indie atomic philosophy, Ijldische Studien^ ii. 369, which is doubtful ; but the Indie alphabet probably derived thence, possibly from Greece. The conquests of Serimamis may have included a part of India, but only Brunnhofer finds trace of this in Vedic literature, and the character of his work we have already described.



544 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
aided, and acquired new strength from more modern contact with the sun-worshippers of the West. Of Iranian influence in
early times, along the line of Hindu religious development, there
is scarcely a trace, although in 509 b.c, Darius's general conquered the land about the Indus.' But the most zealous advo
cate of Persia's prestige can find little to support his claims in pre-Buddhistic Brahmanic literature, though such claims have been made, not only in respect of the position of secondary
divinities, but even as regards eschatological conceptions. It
is not so easy to refute an improbable historical theory as it is to propound it, but, on the other hand, the onus probandi rests upon him that propounds it, and till now all arguments on this point have resulted only in increasing the number of unproved hypotheses, which the historian should mention and
may then dismiss.
The Northern dynasty that ruled in India in the sixth century seems to have had a hand in spreading Iranian sun-worship beyond the Indus, but we doubt whether the radical effect of this dominion and its belief (it is described by Kosmas, an Egyptian traveller of the time) is as great as has been
claimed.^ From Greece, the Hindus received architectural designs, numismatic, and perhaps a few literary hints, but they got thence
neither religious myths, nor, with the possible exception of the cult of the later Love-god and fresh encouragement to phallic
1 Senart attributes to the Achaemenides certain Indie formulae of administration. lA. XX. 256. 2 Certain Hindu names, like those to which we called attention in the epic, containing Mihira, i^., Mithra ; the Magas, i.e., Magi ; and recommendations of sunworship in the Puranas are the facts on which Weber bases a theory of great influence of Persia at this later period. Weber claims, in fact, that the native sun-worship was quite replaced by this importation (Indische Skizzsn, p. 104). This we do not believe. Even the great number of Persians who, driven out by Arabians, settled in Gujarat (the name of Bombay is the same with Pumbadita, a Jewish settlement in Mesopotamia) had no other effect on the Brahmanic world that absorbed them iili., p. 109) than to intensify the fervor of a native cult.



INDIA AND THE WEST. 545
worship, new rites;' though they may have borrowed some
fables, and one even hears of a Buddhistic king endeavoring to buy a sophist of Antiochus. But there is no ground for assuming philosophical influence on Brahmanism.
Christianity came late into the religious life of India, and as a doctrine made upon her no deep or lasting impression. Certain details of Christian story have been woven into the legends
of Krishna, and some scholars believe that the monotheistic worshippers depicted in the pseudo-epic were Christians. But in respect of the latter point it is enough to say that this account of foreign belief had no new monotheizing effect upon the pantheism of India ; the strange (unbrahmanic) god was simply accepted as Vishnu. Nor do we believe that the faithdoctrine of Hindu sectarianism and the trinitarianism of India were derived from Christian sources. But it must be admitted
to be historically possible that the creed of the Christians, known
to the Hindus of the sixth and seventh centuries, may have
suggested to the latter the idea of the trinity as a means of adjusting the claims of Brahmanism, Krishnaism, and ^ivaism.^ But from the Mohammedan India has taken much, albeit
1 Wfiber ascribes to Greek influence tlie Hindus' first acquaintance witli the planets. On a possible dramatic loan see above, p. 2, note. The Greeks were first to get into the heart of India (as far as Patna), and between the court of Antiochus the Great and the king Saubhagasena there was formal exchange of ambassadors in the third century B.C. The name of Demetrius appears as Dattamitra in the Hindu epic. He had " extended his rule over the Indus as far as the Hydaspes and perhaps over Malava and Gujarat " (about 200 B.C. ; Weber, Skizzeii). In the second century Menandros (the Buddhists' 'Milinda') got as far as the Jumna; but his successors retreated to the Punjab and eventually to Kabul {ib). Compare also Weber, SHz. d. kbnig.' Preiiss. Akad.^ 1890, p. 901 ff., Die Griechen in Indien. The period of Greek influence coincides with that of Buddhist supremacy in its first vigor, and it is for this reason that Brahmanic literature and religion were so untouched by it. There is to our mind no great probability that the Hindu epic owes anything to that of Greece, although Weber has put in a strong plea for this view in his essay Ueber das Rdmdyana. 2 The romance of a Russian traveller's late ' discovery,' which Sanskrit scholars estimate at its true value, but which may seem to others worthy of regard, is perhaps, in view of the interest taken in it, one that should be told correctly. Nicholas



546 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
only in the last few centuries. When Alexander entered India there were still two bodies of Indie people west of the Indus. But the trend was eastward, as it had been for centuries, and the
first inroad of the Mohammedan had little further effect than to seize a land forsaken by Aryans and given over to the hordes of the North. The foundation of the new empire was not laid till the permanent occupation of the Punjab and annexation of Lahore in 1022-23. In the thirteenth century all Hindustan acknowledged the authority of the slave sultan cf
Delhi. ^ Akbar died in 1605. By the end of the century the Mogul rule was broken ; the Mahratta princes became imperial. It is now just in this period of Mohammedan power when arise the deistic reforming sects, which, as we have shown, were surrounded with deists and trinitarians. Here, then, we draw the
line across the inner development of India's religions, with
Notovitch asserts that he discovered seven years ago in the Tibetan monastery of Himis, a work which purports to give a life of Christ from birth to death, including sixteen years spent in India. This life of *Issa' (Jesus) is declared to have been written in the first century of the Christian era. Unfortunately for the reputation of the finder, he made a mistake in exploiting his discovery, and stated that his manuscript had been translated for him by the monks of Himis 'out of the original Pali,' a dialect that these monks could not understand if they had specimgns of it before them. This settled Notovitch's case, and since of course he did not transcribe a word of the MS. thus freely put at his disposal, but published the forgery in a French 'translation,' he may be added to the list of other imposters of his ilk. The humbug has been exposed for some time, and we know of no one who, having a right to express an opinion, believes Notovitch's tale, though some ignorant people have been hoaxed by it. If the blank sixteen years. in Christ's life ever be explained, it maybe found that they were passed in a Zoroastrian environment; but until real evidence be brought to show that Christ was in India, the wise will continue to doubt it. As little proof exists, it may be added, of Buddhistic influence in the making of the Gospels. But this point is nowadays scarcely worth discussing, for competent scholars no longer refer vague likenesses to borrowing. Certain features are common to the story of Christ and to the legends of Buddha; but they are common to other divine narratives also. Tlie striking similarities are not found in the earliest texts of the Southern Buddhists, Tga for Jesus is modern, Weber, loc. cit., p. 931. 1 Elphinstone, i. pp. 140, 50S; ii. chap. i.

Kabir, Nanak, Dadu, and p2i-haps even Basava. In the philosophy of the age that succeeds the epic there are but two
phases of religion, pantheism for the wise, a more or less
deistic polytheism for the vulgar' (in isolated cases may Le
added the monotheism of certain scholastic philosophers); and
so Indie religion continued till the advent of Islamism. Never
theless, though under Mohammedan influence,^ the most thoughtful spirits of India received monotheism and gave up pantheism, yet was the religious attitude of these thinkers not averse from that taken by the Sankyan philosophers and by the earlier pantheists. From a philosophical point of view one must,
indeed, separate the two. But all these, the Unitarian Hariharaist, the real pantheist of the Upanishads, who completed
the work of the Vedic quasi-pantheist, and the circle that comprises Kabir, Nanak, and Dadu, were united in that they stood
against encircling polytheism. They were religiously at one in that they gave up the cult of many divinities, which represented respectively nature-worship and fiend-worship (with beast-worship), for the worship of one god. Therefore it is that, while native advance stops with the Mohammedan conquest, one may yet claim an uninterrupted progress for the higher Indie religion, a continual elevation of the thoughts of the wise
;
although at the same time, beside and below this, there is the circle of lower beliefs that continually revolves upon itself. For in the zoolatry'* and polytheism that adores monsters to-day
1 Though immediately before it the Harihara cult, survival of Sankhyan dualism, is practically monotheistic. Basava belongs to the twelfth century. 2 The literary exchange in the realm of fable between Arabia and later Sanskrit writers (of the twelfth century) is very evident. Thus in Indie dress appear at this time the story of Troy, of the passage over the Red Sea, of Jonas, etc. On the other hand, the Arabians translated native Hindu fables. See Weber, IS. iii. 327, Uelcr den Zusammenhang griechischer Fabeln mit indische7i, and Indische Skizzcn, p. Ill, and Die Griechen in Indien. Arabia further drew on India for philosophical material, and Alberuni himself translated Kapila's work (Weber, loc. cit.). 3 Whereby cows, snakes, cats (sacred to one of the (Jivaite 'mothers'), crocodiles, monkeys, etc., are worshipped.



548 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
it is difificult to see a form of religion higher in any respect
than that more simple nature-polytheism which first obtained.''
This lower aspect of Indie religions hinges historically on
the relation between the accepted cults of Hinduism ^ and those of the wild tribes. We cannot venture to make any statements that will cast upon this question more light than has been thrown by the above account of the latter cults and of their points of contact with Hinduism. It may be taken for granted that with the entrance into the body politic of a class composed of vanquished^ or vanquishing natives, some of the religion of the latter may have been received also. Such,
there is every reason to believe, was the original worship of Qiva as Qarva, Bhava, and of Krishna ; in other words, of the
first features of modern sectarian Hinduism, though this has
been so influenced by Aryan civilization that it has become
an integral part of Hindu religion.^
But, again, for a further question here presents itself, how much in India to-day is Aryan ? We are inclined to answer
that very little of blood or of religion is Aryan. Some priestly families keep perhaps a strain of Aryan blood. But Hindu
literature is not afraid to state how many of its authors are of low caste, how many of its priests were begotten of mixed marriages, how many formed low connections ; while both legendary and prophetic {ex postfacto) history speak too often'
1 Pantheists in name alone, most of the lower caste-men are practically polytheists, and this means that they are at bottom dualists. They are wont to worship assiduously but one of the gods they recognize. 2 Where Brahmanism may be said to cease and Hinduism to begin can be defined but vaguely. Krishnaism is rank Hinduism. But Qivaism is half Brahmanic. For the rest, In its essential aspects, Hinduism is as old as the Hindus. Only the form changes (as it intrudes upon Brahmanism). 3 It is highly probable that the mention of the Northwestern Qudras in Mbha. vi. 9. d"] refers to the Afghan Sudroi, and that the slave-caste as a whole, which bears the name (^udra, received this appellation first as conquered tribes of Afghanistan. 4 Brahmanism has always been an island in a sea. Ev^n in the Brahmanic age there is evidence to show that it was the isolated belief of a comparatively small group of minds. It did not even control all tlie Aryan population.

of slave-kings and the evil times when low castes will reign, for any unprejudiced person to doubt that the Hindu population, excluding many pure priests but including many of the priests and the Rajputs (' sons of kings '), represents Aryan
hood even less than the belief of. the Rig Veda represents the
primitive religion ; and how little of aboriginal Aryan faith is
reflected in that work has been shown already.
As one reviews the post-Vedic religions of civilized India he is impressed with the fact that, heterogeneous as they are,
they yet in some regards are so alike as to present, when contrasted with other beliefs, a homogeneous whole. A certain
uniqueness of religious style, so to speak, differentiates every
expression of India's theosophy from that of her Western neighbors. What is common and world-wide in the forms of Indie faith we have shown in a previous chapter. But on this universal foundation India has erected many individual temples, temples built after designs which are not uniform, but are all
self-sketched, and therefore peculiar to herself. In each of these mental houses of God there is revealed the same disposition, and that disposition is necessarily identical with that
expressed in her profane artistry,^ for the form of religion is
as much a matter of national taste as is that which is embodied
in literature, architecture, and painting. And this taste, as expressed in religion, isolates Brahmanic and Hinduistic India,
1 We refer partly to literature, that of the drama and novel, for instance ; and
partly to the fine arts. But in connection with the latter it may be remarked that painting, and the fine arts generally, are expressly reckoned as tlie pursuit of slaves alone. For instance, even as late a jurist as he that wrote the law-code of ' Vishnu
'
thus (chap, ii.) parcels out the duties and occupations of the four castes : The duty of a priest is to teach tlie Veda, his means of livelihood is to sacrifice for others and to receive alms ; the duty of the warrior is to fight, his means of livelihood is to receive taxes for protecting the other castes ; the duty of the Vaigya is to tend cattle, his means of livelihood is gain from flocks, farm, trade, or money-lending. The duty of a slave, Qudra, is to serve the three upper castes ; his means of livelihood is the
fine arts.

placing her apart, both from the gloom of Egypt and the grace of Greece ; even as in her earliest records she shows herself
individual, as contrasted with her Aryan kinsfolk. Like Egypt, she feels her dead ever around her, and her cult is tinged with
darkness ; but she is fond of pleasure, and seeks it deliriously.
Like Greece, she loves beauty, but she loves more to decorate
it ; and again, she rejoices in her gods, but she rejoices with
fear ; fear that overcomes reason, and pictures such horrors as are conjured up by the wild leaps of an uncurbed fancy. For an imagination that knows no let has run away with every form
of her intellectual productivity, theosophy as well as art. This
is perceptible even in her ritualistic, scientific, and philosophical systems ; for though it is an element that at first seems
incongruous with such systems, it is yet in reality the factor that has produced them. Complex, varied, minute, exact, as
are the details which she loves to elaborate in all her work,
they are the result of this same unfettered imagination, which follows out every fancy, pleased with them all, exaggerating every present interest, unconfined by especial regard for what
is essential.-"^ This is a heavy charge to bring, nor can it be passed over with the usual remark that one must accept
India's canon as authoritative for herself, for the taste of cosmopolitan civilization is the only norm of judgment, a norm accepted even by the Hindus of the present day when they have learned what it is. But we do not bring the charge of extravagance for the sake of comparing India unfavorably with the Occident. Confining ourselves to the historical method of treatment which we have endeavored heretofore to maintain, we wish to point out the important bearings which this intellectual
trait has had upon the lesser products of India's religious activity.
1 It is this that has exaggerated, though not produced, that most marked of native behefs, a faith which intertwines with every system, Brahmanic, Buddhistic, or Hinduistic, a belief in an ecstatic power in man which gives hira control over supernatu. ral forces. To-day this Yogism and Mahatmaisra, which is visible even in the Rig Veda, is nothing but unbridled fancy playing with mesmerism and lies.



INDIA AND THE WEST. SSI
Through the whole extent of religious literature one finds
what are apparently rare and valuable bits of historical information. It is these which, from the point of view to which
we have just referred, one must learn to estimate at their real worth. In nine cases out of ten, these seeming truths are due only to the light imagination of a subsequent age, playing at will over the records of the past, and seeking by a mental
caper to leap over what it fails to understand. To the Oriental of an age still later all the facts deducible from such statements
as are embodied in the hoary literature of antiquity appear to
be historical data, and, if mystic in tone, these statements are
to him an old revelation of profoundest truth. But the Occidental, who recognizes no hidden wisdom in palpable mystifica
tion, should hesitate also to accept at their face value such historical notes as have been drafted by the same priestly hand. Nor would we confine the application of this principle to the output of extant Brahmanic works. The same truth cuts right and left among many utterances of the Vedic seers and all the theories built upon them. To pick out here and there an ipse
dixit of one of the later fanciful Vedic poets, who lived in a
period as Brahmanic (that is, as ritualistic) as is that which is
represented by the actual ritual-texts, and attempt to recon
struct the original form of divinities on the basis of such vaga
ries is useless, for it is an unhistorical method which ignores
ancient conditions. In less degree, because here the conditions are more obvious,
does this apply to the religious interpretation of the great body of literature which has conserved for posterity the beginnings of Hinduism. But upon this we have already animadverted,
and now need only range this literature in line with its prede
cessors. Not because the epic pictures Krishna as making obeisance to Qiva is Krishna here the undeveloped man-god,
who represents but the beginning of his (later) greatness, and
is still subject to the older giva. On the contrary, it is the



SS2 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
epic's last extravagance in regard to Qiva (who has already bowed before the great image of Krishna-Vishnu) that demands
a furious counter-blast against the rival god. It is the Qivaite who says that Krishna-Vishnu bows ; and because it is the Qivaite, and because this is the national mode of expression of every
sectary, therefore what the Qivaite says is in all probability his
torically false, and the sober historian will at least not discover
' the earlier Krishna ' in the Krishna portrayed by his rival's
satellites. But when one comes to the modern sects, then he has- to deplore not so much the lack of historical data as the gro
tesque form into which this same over-vivid imagination of
the Hindu has builded his gods. As the scientific systems
grow more and more fancifully detailed, and as the liturgy
flowers out into the most extraordinary bloom of weird legend, so the images of the gods, to the eye in their temples, to the mind in the descriptions of them, take to themselves the most uncouth details imagined by a curious fancy. This god is an
ascetic; he must be portrayed with the ascetic's hair, the ascetic's wild appearance. He kills ; he must be depicted as a monster, every trait exaggerated, every conceivable horror detailed. This god sported with the shepherdesses ; he must have love-adven
tures related in full, and be worshipped as a darling god of
love ; and in this worship all must be pictured in excess, that weaker mortal power may strive to appreciate the magnitude
of the divine in every fine detail. These traits are those of late Vedism, Brahmanism, and Hinduism. But how marked is the contrast with the earlier Vedic age ! The grotesque fancy, the love of minutiae, in a word, the extravagance of imagination and unreason are here absent, or present only in hymns that contrast vividly with those of the older tone. This older tone is Aryan, the later is Hindu, and it is another proof of what we have already emphasized, that the Hinduizing influence was felt in the later Vedic



INDIA AND THE WEST. 553
or Brahmanic period. There is, indeed, almost as great a gulf between the Dawn-hymns and the Qatapatha as there is between the latter and the Puranas. One may rest assured that the perverted later taste reproduces the advance of Hindu influence upon the Aryan mind exactly in proportion to the enor
mity displayed.
On the other hand, from the point of view of morality, Brah
manic religion is not in any way individual. The race, whether
Aryan or Hinduistic, had as fragile virtue as have other folks, and shows the same tentative efforts to become purer as those which characterize every national advance. There is, perhaps,
a little too much formal insistance on veraciousness, and one
is rather inclined to suspect, despite Miiller's brave defence of
the Hindu in this regard, that lying came very naturally to a people whose law-givers were so continuously harping on the beauty of truth. The vicious caste-system necessarily scheduled immorality in accordance with the caste order, as certain crimes
in other countries are estimated according to the race of the sinner rather than according to any abstract standard. In the matter of precept we know no better moral laws than those promulgated by the Brahmans, but they are the laws that every people evolves for itself. Religious immorality, the excess of
^akti worship, is also not peculiar to the Hindu. If one ask how the morality of India as a whole compares with that of other countries, we reply that, including religious excesses, it stands level with the personal morality of Greece in her best days,^
1 The Hindu sectarian cults are often strangely like those of Greece in details, which, as we have already suggested, must revert to a like, though not necessarily mutual, source of primitive superstition. Even the sacred free bulls, which roam at large, look like old familiar friends, dip^Tuv 6vtuiv raiptov iv t$ toS IlotreiSfipos Upv (Plato, Kritias. 119); and we have dared to question whether Lang's ' Bull-roarer

might not be sought in the command that the priest should make the bull roar at the sacrifice; and in tlie verse of the Rig Veda which says that the priests " beget (produce) the Dawn by means of the roar of a bull " (vii. 79. 4) ; or must the bull be soma ? For Miiller's defence of the Hindu's veraciousness, see his India, What Can It Teach Us, p. 34.

and that without the religiously sensual (Hindu) element, it is nominally on a par with that of London or New York. Thereare good and bad men, and these make good and bad coteries, which stand inside the pale of a religious profession. There
is not m'uch theoretical difference. Few of the older gods are
virtuous, and Right, even in the Rig Veda, is the moral power, that is. Right as Order, correct behavior, the prototype
both of ritual and of acdra, custom, which rules the gods. In the law-court the gods are a moral group, and two of them,
Varuna and Agni, hate respectively the sins of adultery and
untruth. In the law it is, however, Dharma and the Fathergod or his diadochos, who, handing down heavenly precepts, gives all moral laws, though it must be confessed that the Father-god is almost the last to care for morality. And pure Brahmanism stops with Brahma. In modern Hinduism, to kill, lust, steal, drink, so far from offending, may please a god that
is amorous, or bloodthirsty, or, like Qiva, is ' the lord of thieves.' Morality here has God himself against it. In the Rig Veda, to sin is merely to displease a god. But even in Brahmanism, as in Buddhism, there is not that intimate connection betvreen goodness and godness that obtains in Christianity. The Brah
man, like the Buddhist, was self-controlled, in order to exert control upon the gods and the course of his own future life. He not only, as is perhaps the case elsewhere, was moral with
an ulterior motive, but his moral code lacked the divine hand. It was felt as a system which he applied to himself for his own good. He did not assume that he offended a god by not
following it, except in two special cases, as in sins against
Agni and Varuna. Ulterior motives are deprecated, but because he that seeks absorption into God must quit desires.^
1 Some exception may be taken to this on the ground that moral laws really are referred to the Creator in one form or anotherr. This we acknowledge as a theory of authority, but it so seldom comes into play, and there is so little rapport between gods and moral goodness, that the difference in this regard is greater by far than the resemblance. A Christian sins against God, a Hindu sins against himself. The



INDIA AND THE WEST. 555
We have said that the moral eode of the Hindus at its best seems to be on a par with the best as found elsewhere. Not to
lie, not to steal, not to injure another illegally,-^ to be brave, to be
loyal, to be hospitable, — these are the factors of its early and
late law. In certain late cases may be added 'to be self
restrained.' But if these laws be compared with those, of the
savage races it will be found that most of them are also factors of primitive ethics. Therefore we say that the Hindu code as a whole is savage and antique, and that, excluding religious excess and debauchery, it is on a par with the modern ethical code only nominally. In reality, however, this savage and ancient code is not on a level with that of to-day. And the reason
is that the ideal of each is different. In the savage and old
world conception of morality it is the ideal virtue that is repre
sented by the code. It was distinct laudation to say of a man
that he did not lie, or steal, and that he was hospitable.^ But
to-day, while these factors remain to formulate the code, they no longer represent ideal virtue. Nay rather, they are but the assumed base of virtue, and so thoroughly is this assumed that to say of a gentleman that he does not lie or steal is not praise,
but rather an insult, since the imputation to him of what is but the virtue of children is no longer an encomium when applied to the adult, who is supposed to have passed the point where theft and lying are moral temptations, and to have reached a point where, on the basis of these savage, antique, and now
childish virtues, he strives for a higher moral ideal. And this ideal of to-day, which makes fair-mindedness, liberality of thought, and
altruism the respective representatives of the savage virtues
of manual honesty, truth-speaking, and hospitahty, is just what
Christian may be punislied by God ; the Hindu punishes himself (the karma). The latter may say that moral laws are of God, but he means that they are natural laws, the violation of which has the same effect as touching fire. 1 The lex talionis is in full force in Hindu law, even in the codes of Hinduism; for example, ' Vishnu,' v. 19. 2 Deceit of a foe is no sin in any system. " All is fair in war."



SS6 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
is lacking in the more primitive ideal formulated in the code of savages and of the Brahman alike.' It is not found at all among savages, and they may be left on one side. In India all the factors of the modern code are entirely lacking at the
time when the old code was first completely formulated. Liberality of thought comes in with the era of the Upanishads, but it is a restricted freedom. Altruism is unknown to pure Brahmanism. But it obtains among the Buddhists, who also have liberality of thought and fair-mindedness. Hence, from the
point of view of the higher morality, one must confess that
Buddhism offers the best parallel to the best of to-day. On the other hand, Buddhistic altruism exceeds all other.
We have sketched the sphere of influence exerted by the West upon India, and found it on the whole inconsiderable.
The Indie religions till the twelfth century assimilated what
little they drew from foreign sources, and stand before the world as a peculiar growth, native to the soil in all their essen
tial characteristics.''
But to the other side of India's contact with the West we
have as yet barely alluded. India has given as she has received. What influence has she had upon Western cults and beliefs ?
The worship that substituted idols for ideal forms we have
traced back to the end of the Vedic period. It is not, however, a mark of early Brahmanism, nor is it a pronounced feature before the age of Buddhism. But in Buddha's time, or soon after, flourished the worship of images, and with it the
respect for relics. The latter feature of the new religion made' necessary shrines to keep the holy objects, sacred museums, which soon became the formal stupas, above-ground
^ This idea may be carried out in other instances. The bravery of civilization^ not the bravado that savages call bravery, and modesty is now a virtue where boasting used to be reckoned as the necessary complement of bravery. As for hospitality in the old sense, it is not now a ^ virtue ' not to kill a guest. 2 India's relations with Rome were late and wholly of mercantile character.



INDIA AND THE WEST. 557
and under-ground, and these made the first temples of India.^
Fully developed, they became the great religious buildings
affected by Buddhism, with their idol service, prostrations,
repetitions of prayers, dim religious light (lamp-service), offer
ings of flowers, fruits, etc. From this source may have been
derived many of the details in the Roman Catholic worship, which appears to have taken from Buddhism the rosary, origi
nally a mark of the Qivaite.'^ By what is, to say the least, an extraordinary coincidence, each of these churches is con
spicuous for its use of holy water, choirs, sacred pictures,
tonsure, vestments, the bell in religious service, the orders of nuns, monks, and the vows of the monastic system.^ The most curious loan made by the Roman and Greek churches is, however, the quasi-worship of Gotama Buddha himself (in
so far as a Romanist worships his saints), for, under cover of the Barlaam and Josaphat story, Buddha has found a niche as a_ saint in the row of canonized Catholic worthies, and has his saint-day in the calendar of the Greek and Roman churches.' But it is not his mother who is the Virgin of Lamaism, which has made of Buddha the Supreme God. Besides external phases of the religious cult, India has given
1 It is interesting, as showing incidentally the close connection between Buddhism and (Jivaism in other than philosophical aspects, that the first Indie grotto-temple mentioned by foreigners (in the third century A.D.) was -one which contained a statue of an androgynous (Qivaite) deity (Weber, Indischc Skizze7i, p. 86, note). 2 Rosaries are first mentioned in the AV. Parigista, xliii. 4. 1 1 (Leumann, Rosaries). 8 In Lamaism there is also the tiara-crowned pope, and the transubstantiation theory ; the reverence to Virgin and Child, confessions, fasts, purgatory, abbots, cardinals, etc. Compare David's Hibbert Lectures, p. 193. * The literature on this subject is very extensive (see the Bibliography). On Buddhism and Christianity see Bohlen's Aites Indien, i. 334 (Weber, Indische Skizzen, p. 92). At a recent meeting of the British Association E. B. Tylor presented a paper in which is made an attempt to show Buddhistic .influence on pre-Columbian culture in America. On comparing the Aztec picture-writing account of the journey of the soul after death with Buddhistic eschatology, he is forced 'to the conclusion that there was direct transmission from Buddliism. We require more proof than Aztec pictures of hell to believe any such theory ; and reckon this attempt to those already discussed in the eighth chapter.



S5S THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
to the West a certain class of literary works and certain philo
sophical ideas. The former consists, of course, in the fableliterature, which spread from India to Eastern Europe (Babrius) and has preserved in many tales of to-day nothing more than Buddhistic Birth-stories or other Indie tales (the Pancatantra) and legends.^ Of these we can make only passing mention here, to turn at once to the more important question of philosophical and religious borrowing.
It has been claimed, as we have incidentally stated, that the Logos doctrine was imported from India. Were this so, it
would, indeed, be a fact of great historical importance, but,
interesting as would be such a loan, we cannot see that the suggestion is based on data of cogent character. The history of the doctrine in India and Greece is simply this : Vac, Speech or Word, appears in the Rig Veda (in the hymn cited above, p. 143) as an active female divine power, showing grace to mortals. In the Brahmanic period Vac becomes more and more like the Greek Logos, and it may truthfully be said that in this period " the Word was God." In Greece, on the other hand, the conception of Logos begins with Heraclitus, passes on to the Stoics ; is adopted by Philo ; becomes a prominent feature -of Neo-Platonism ; and reappears in the Gospel of St.
John. It is certainly legitimate to suppose that Heraclitus might have received the idea indirectly, if not directly, from contemporary Eastern philosophers ; but the fact that he did so remains unproved ; nor is there any foundation for the assumption of borrowing other than the resemblance between the Grecian and Indie conceptions. But this resemblance is scarcely marked enough in essential features to prejudice one in favor of Weber's theory (amplified by Garbe), as it is not
detailed enough to be striking, for Vac is never more than
one of many female abstractions.
1 It is a mooted question in how far the influence in this Une has been reciprocal. See Indische Studien, iii. 128.



INDIA AND THE WEST., 559
With the exception of the one case to be mentioned immediately, we are forced to take the same position in regard to the similarity between other forms of early Greek and Hindu philosophy. Both Thales and Parmenides were indeed anticipated by Hindu sages, and the Eleatic school seems to be but a reflexion of the Upanishads. The doctrines of Anaximander and Heraclitus are, perhaps, not known first in Greece, but there is no evidence that they were not original to Greece, or that they were borrowed from India, however much older may be the parallel trains of thought on Indie soil. Quite as decidedly, however, as we deny all appearance of borrowing on the part of the founders of other early Grecian schools, must we claim the thought of India to be the archetype of Pythagorean philosophy. After a careful review of
the points of contact, and weighing as dispassionately as pos
sible the historical evidence for and against the originality of Pythagoras, we are unable to come to any other conclusion than that the Greek philosopher took his whole system indirectly from India. His ' numbers,' indeed, are the Sankhya only in appearances.-' But his theory of metempsychosis is the Indie samsara, and Plato is full of Sankhyan thought, worked out by him but taken from Pythagoras. Before the sixth century B.C.
all the religious-philosophical ideas of Pythagoras are current in India (L. von Schroeder, Pythagoras). If there were but one or two of these cases, they might be set aside as accidental coincidences, but such coincidences are too numerous to be the result of chance. Even in details the transmigration theory
of Pythagoras harmonizes with that of India. Further (after Schroeder und Garbe) may be mentioned the curious prohibition against eating beans ; the Hesiodic-Pythagorean Trpos ijAtov /a^
o^iX"" ; the vow of silence, like that taken by the Hindu muni;
the doctrine oi five elements (aether as fifth); above all, the so-called Pythagorean Theorem, developed in the mathematical

Qulvasutras ' of India ; the irrrational number \/2 ; then the whole character of the religious-philosophical fraternity, which
is exactly analogous to the Indie orders of the time ; and finally the mystic sj^eculation, which is peculiar to the Pythagorean
school, and bears a striking resemblance to the fantastical notions affected by the authors of the Brahmana." Greek legend is full of the Samian's travels to Egypt, Chaldaea, Phoenicia, and India. The fire beneath this smoke is hidden. One
knows not how much to believe of such tales. But they only strengthen the inference, drawn from ' the Pythagorean school,' the man's work itself, that the mysticism and numbers with which he is surrounded are taken from that system of numbers and from that mysticism which are so astonishingly like his own. All subsequent philosophies borrowed from Pythagoreanism, and in so far has India helped to form the mind of Europe.^ But we cannot omit a yet more important religious influence exerted by India upon the West. As is well known, NeoPlatonism and Christian Gnosticism owe much to India. The
Gnostic ideas in regard to a plurality of heavens and spiritual
worlds go back directly to Hindu sources. Soul and light are one in the Sankhya system before they become so in Greece, and when they appear united in Greece it is by means of the thought which is borrowed from India. The famous 'three qualities ' of the Sankhya reappear as the Gnostic ' three classes,'

See, for instance, Weber, Die Griechen in Indian. But to us the minute resemblance appears too striking to be accidental. 4 Lassen, and Weber, Indische Skizzen, p. 91.



INDIA AND THE WEST. 561
says : " The views of Plotinus _are in perfect agreement with those of the Sankhya system." ^ Porphyry, the disciple of Plotinus, has the Yoga doctrine of immediate perception of truth leading to union with the deity. As is well known and undis
puted, this Porphyry copies directly from the treatise of Bardesanes, which contains an account of the Brahmans ; '^ while in many instances he simply repeats the tenets of the Sankhya philosophy. The means of communication may have been Alexandria, where met the trades of the East and West. Perhaps the philosophers of India as well as of Greece were brought together there. But, if the East and West had a mutual meeting-ground, the ideas common to both occupy no common place in their respective homes. In Greece, Pythagoreanism
and Gnosticism are strange, and are felt as such by the natives.
In India these traits are founded on ancient beliefs, long cur
rent, universal, nationally recognized. The question of giver
and receiver, then, admitting the identity of thought, can scarcely be raised. If two men meet, one a Methodist and one a Baptist, and after they have conversed the Methodist be found totally immersed, he will not be credited with having invented independently his n§w mode of baptism.
India's influence as an intellectual factor in modern European thought has thus far been of the slightest. Her modern deism is borrowed, and her pantheism is not scientific. Sanskrit scholars are rather fond of citing the pathetic words of Schopenhauer, who, speaking of the Upanishads, says that the study
of these works " has been the solace of my life ; it will be the solace of my death"; but Schopenhauer knew the Upanishads only in a very free form of translation, and it can scarcely have been the loose philosophy so much as the elevated spirit of
1 Garbe, in a recent number of the Monist, where is given a resums of the relations between Greek and Hindu philosophical thought. 2 Weber, loc. cU.



562 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
these works that solaced the unphilosophical bitterness of his
life This general impression will doubtless continue to be felt by all that study the best works of Brahmanism. The
sincerity, the fearless search of the Indie sages for truth, their
loftiness of thinking, all these will affect the religious student
of every clime and age, though the fancied result of their thinking may pass without effect over a modern mind. For a philosophy that must be orthodox can never be definitive. But, if one turn from the orthodox completed systems to the tentative beginnings of the Vedanta (in the Upanishads), he finds
as the basis of this earlier speculation only an a priori meta
physical assumption.'' Apart from philosophical influence there is at present more
or less interest in Europe and America in Indie superstition and spiritualism, and half-educated people will doubtless be influenced for some time to come by Mahatmaism and Yogism, just as they are moved by native seance-spirits and mesmerism. Blavatskyism (which represents no phase of - Buddhism) will always find disciples among the ignorant classes, especially in an agnostic or atheistic environment, so that one should
attribute the mental attitude of such minds to their lack
of culture rather than to India ; for if Mahatmaism had not been discovered, they would still profess it under another name. Buddhism, too, apart from Hartmann, may be said to have some influence on popular thought, yet it is a very unreal Buddhism, which amounts only to the adoption of an altruistic creed. But we know of none among the many that profess themselves ' Buddhists ' who has really adopted Buddhistic principles, "and but few who even understand those principles. A bar to the adoption of Buddhism lies in the implicit neces

sity of renunciation for all who would become perfected, and in the explicit doctrine of karma in its native form. The true
Buddhist is not satisfied to be a third-class Buddhist, that is,
simply a man that seeks to avoid lust, anger, and ignorance. He will become a sscond-class Buddhist and renounce the
world, give up all family ties and earthly affections, and enter the Order. But he will not do this, thinking that he is thereby
to become perfect. For, to be a first-class Buddhist, he must get wisdom. He must believe in the impermanence of everything, and in the awful continuation of his own karma as a
resultant group, which, as such, will continue to exist if, to the
purity and peace of the lower classes of Buddhists, he fail to add in his own case the wisdom that understands the truth of this karma doctrine.^ Now no modern mind will believe this hypothesis of karma, and no modern will even enter the Order. Nevertheless, while one may not become a true Buddhist in the native sense, it is possible to be a Buddhist in a higher sense,
and in its new form this is a religion that will doubtless attract many Occidentals, though it is almost too chaste to win adherents where marriage is not regarded as detrimental to high thinking. But if one substitute for the Buddhistic karma the karma of to-day, he may well believe that his acts are to have
effect hereafter, not as a complex but as individual factors in determining the goodness of his descendants and indirectly of his environment. Then there remains the attainment of purity,
kindness,^ and wisdom, which last may be interpreted, in accordance with the spirit of the Master, as seeing things in their

The Buddhist is no Stoic save in the stoicism with which he looks forward to his own end. Rhys Davids has suggested that the popularity of Tibet Buddhism in distinction from Southern Buddhism may have been due to t!ie greater weight laid by the former on altruism. For, while the earlier Buddhist strives chiefly for his own perfection, the spiritualist of the North affects greater love

true relations, and the abandonment of whatever prevents such attainment, namely, of lust, anger, and ignorance. But to be a
true Buddhist one must renounce, as lust, all desire of evil, of
future life, which brings evil ; and must live without other hope than that of extinguishing all desire and passion, believ
ing that in so doing he will at death be annihilated, that is, that he will have caused his acts to cease to work for good or
ill, and that, since being without a soul he exists only in his
acts, he will in their cessation also cease to be. At least one thing, maybe learned from Buddhism. It is possible to be religious without being devout. True Buddhism is the only religion which, discarding all animism, consists in
character and wisdom. But neither in sacrificial works, nor in
kindness alone, nor in wisdom alone, lies the highest. One
must renounce all selfish desires and live to build up a char
acter of which the signs are purity, love for all, and that courageous wisdom which is calm insight into truth. The Bud
dhist worked out his own salvation without fear or trembling.
To these characteristics may be added that tolerance and free
dom of thought which are so dissimilar to the traits of many
other religions. So much may be learned from Buddhism, and it were much only to know that such a religion existed twenty-four centuries ago. But in what, from a wider point of view, lies the impor
tance of the study of Hindu religions ? Not, we venture to
think, in their face value for the religious or philosophical life
of the Occident, but in the revelation, which is made by this
study, of the origin and growth of theistic ideas in one land
;
in the light these cast by analogy on the origin of such ideas
elsewhere ; in the prodigious significance of the religious factor
for his kind, and becomes wise to save others. The former is content to be an Arhat
;
the latter desires to be a Bodhisat, 'teacher of the law' (Hibbcrt Lectures, p. 254). We think, however, that the latter's success with the vulgar was the result rather of his own greater mental vulgarity and animism.

in the development of a race, as exhibited in this instance
;
in the inspiring review of that development as it is seen through
successive ages in the loftiest aspirations of a great people
;
and finally in the lesson taught by the intellectual and religious fate of them among that people that have substituted, like the
Brahman ritualist, form for spirit ; like the Vedantist, ideas for
ideals ; like the sectary, emotion for morality. But greatest, if woeful, is the lesson taught by that phase of Buddhism, which has developed into Lamaism and its kindred cults. For here one learns how few are they that can endure to be wise, how inaccessible to the masses is the height on which sits the sage, how unpalatable to the vulgar is a religion without credulity.
Ever since Cotton Mather took up a collection to convert
the Hindus,-' Americans have felt a great interest in missionary
labor in India. Under the just and beneficent rule of the British the Hindus to-day are no longer plundered and murdered in the way they once were ; nor is there now so striking a contrast between the invader's precept and example as obtained when India first made the acquaintance of Christians
militant. The slight progress of the missionaries, who for centuries have been working among the Hindus, is, perhaps, justified
in view of this painful contrast. In its earlier stages there can be no doubt that all such progress was thereby impeded. But it is cause for encouragement, rather than for dismay, that the slowness of Christian advance is in part historically expli
cable, sad as is the explanation. For against what odds had
not the early missionaries to struggle ! Not the heathen, but
the Christian, barred the way against Christianity. Four hun

dred years ago the Portuguese descended upon the Hindus, cross and sword in hand. For a whole century tliese victorious immigrants, with unheard-of cruelty and tyranny, cheated, stripped, and slaughtered the natives. After them came the Dutch, but, Dutch or Portuguese, it was the same. For it was merely another century, during which a new band of Christians hesitated at no crime or outrage, at no meanness or barbarity, which should win them power in India. In 1758 the Dutch were conquered by the English, who, becoming now the chief standard-bearers of the Christian church, committed, under Vansit
tart, more offences against decency, honor, honesty, and human
ity than is pleasant for believer or unbeliever to record ; and, when their own theft had brought revolt, knew no better way to impress the Hindu with the power of Christianity than to
revive the Mogul horror and slay (in their victims' fearful be
lief) both soul and body alike by shooting their captives from the cannon's mouth. Such was Christian example. It is no wonder that the Christian precept (' thou shalt love thy neigh
bor as thyself ') was uttered in vain, or that the faith it epito
mized was rejected. The hand stole and killed; the mouth
said, ' I love you.' The Hindu understood theft and murder, but it took him some time to learn English. One may hope
that this is now forgotten, for the Hindu has not the historical mind. But all this must be remembered when the expenditures of Christianity are weighed with its receipts.'
1 The Portuguese landed in Calcutta in 1498. They were driven out by the Dutch, to whom they ceded their mercantile monopoly, in 1640-1644. The Dutch had arrived in 1 596, and held their ground till their supremacy was wrested from them by Clive in 1758. The British had followed the Dutch closely (arriving in 1600), and were themselves followed soon after by the Germans and Danes (whose activity soon subsided), and by the French. The German company, under whose protection stood Ziegenbalg, was one of the last to enter India, and first to leave it (1717-1726). The most grotesquely hideous era in India's history is that which was inaugurated by the supremacy of the Christian British. I\Iajor Munroe's barbaric punishment of the Sepoys took place, however, in Clive's absence (i 760-1 765). Marshman, i, p. 305, says of this Munroe only that he was " an officer of undaunted

In coming to the end of the long course of Hindu religious thought, it is almost inevitable that one should ask what is the present effect of missionary effort upon this people, and what,
again, will eventually be the direction which the native reli
giofts sense, so strongly implanted in this folk, will take, whether
aided or not by influence from without. Although it is no part of our purpose to examine into the workings of that honest zeal which has succeeded in planting so many stations up the Indie coast, there are yet some obvious
truths which, in the light of religious history, should be an as
sistance to all whose work lies in making Hindu converts. To
compile these truths from this history will not be otiose. In the first place. Christian dogma was formally introduced into South India in the sixth century ; it was known in the North in the seventh, and possibly long before this ; it was the topic of debate by educated Hindus in the sixteenth and seventeenth. It has helped to mould the Hindus' own most intellectual sects ; and, either through the influence of Christian or
native teaching, or that of both, have been created not only the Northern monotheistic schools, but also the strict unitarianism
of the later Southern sects, whose scriptures, for at least some centuries, have inculcated the purest morality and simplest monotheistic creed in language of the most elevated character.^ In the second place, the Hindu sectary has interwoven with
resolution " ! Clive himself was acquitted by his own countrymen of theft, robbery, and extortion ; but the Hindus have not acquitted him or Hastings ; nor will Chris
tianity ever do so. 1 For specimens of the sacred Kural of Tiruvalluvar Narayana, see the examples given by Pope, Indian Antiquary, seventh and following volumes. The Sittars, to whom we have referred above, are a more modern sect. Their precept that love is the essential of religion is not, as in the case of the Hindu idolators, of erotic nature. They seem to be the modern representatives of that Buddhistic division (see above) called Saugatas, whose religion consists in 'kindness to all.' In these sects there is found quietism, a kind of quakerism, pure morality, high teaching, sternest (almost
bigoted) monotheism, and the doctrine of positive altruism, strange to the Hindu idolator as to the Brahman. The Prem Sagar, or ' Ocean of Love,' is a modern



S6S THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
his doctrine of pantiieism that of the trinity. In the third
place, the orthodox Brahman recognizes in tlie cult of Chris
tianity, as that cult is expressed, for instance, in Christmas
festivities, one that is characteristic, in outward form and inner
belief, of a native heterodox sect. In the fourth place, 'the
Hindu sectary believes that the native expression of trinitarian dogma, faith-doctrine, child-god worship, and madonna-worship
takes historical precedence over that of Christianity ; and the
orthodox Hindu believes the same of his completed code of lofty moral teachings. Vishnuism is, again, so catholic that it will
accept Christ as an avatar of Vishnu, but not as an exclusive
manifestation of God. In the fifth place, the Hindu doctors
are very well educated, and often very clever, both delighting in debate and acute in argument. It follows, if we may draw the obvious inference, that, to attack orthodox Brahmanism, or
even heterodox Hinduism, requires much logical ability as well
as learning, and that the best thing a missionary can do in India, if he be not conscious of possessing both these requisites, is
to let the native scholars alone. But native scholars make but a small part of the population, and among the uneducated and 'depressed' classes there is plenty for the missionary to do. Here, tdo, where caste is hated because these classes suffer from it, there is more effect
in preaching equality and the brotherly love of Christianity,
doctrines abhorrent to the social aristocrats, and not favored even by the middle classes. But what here opposes Christian efforts is the splendid system of devotion, the magnificent fetes,
the gorgeous shows, and the tickling ritualism, which please and overawe the fancy of the native, who is apt to desire for
himself a pageant of religion, not to speak of a visible god in
Hindu work, which illustrates the religious love opposed to that of the Sittars, namely, the mystic love of the Krishnaite for his savior, whose grace is given only to him that has faith. It is this mystic rapt adoration that in expression becomes erotic and sensual.



INDIA AND THE WEST. 569
idol form ; while from his religious teacher he demands either
an asceticism which is no part of the Christian faith, or a leadership in sensuous and sensual worship.
What will be the result of proselytizing zeal among these variegated masses ? ' Evidently this depends on where and how it
is exercised. The orthodox theologian will not give up his inherited faith for one that to him is on a par with a schismatic heresy, or take dogmatic instruction from a level which he regards as intellectually below his own. From the Samajas no present help will come to the missionary ; for, while they
have already accepted the spirit of Christianity, liberal Hindus
reject the Christian creed.^ At a later day they will join hands with the missionary, perhaps, but not before the latter is prepared to say : There is but one God, and many are his prophets.
There remain such of the higher classes as can be induced to prefer undogmatic Christianity to polytheism, and the lowest class, which may be persuaded by acts of kindness to accept the dogmas with which these are accompanied. It is with this class that the missionary has succeeded best. In other cases
his success has been in inverse ratio to the amount of his dogmatic teaching. And this we believe to be the key to the second problem. For, if one examine the maze of India's tangled creeds, he will be surprised to find that, though dog
matic Christianity has its Indie representative, there yet is no
indigenous representative of undogmatic Christianity. For a
1 Hinduism itself is unconsciously doing a reforming work among the wild tribes tliat are not touched by the Christian missionary. These tribes, becoming Hinduized, become civilized, and, in so far as they are thus made approachable, they are put in the way of improvement ; though civilization often has a bad effect upon their morals for a season. 2 The substitution of the doctrine of redemption for that of karma is intellectually impossible for an educated Hindu. He may renounce the latter, but he cannot accept the former. T,he nearest approach to such a conception is that of th6 Buddhistic ' Redeemer ' heresy referred to above. In all other regards Samaj and pantheism are too catholic to be affected ; in this regard they are both unyielding.



570 THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.
god in human form is worshipped, and a trinity is revered
;
but this is not Christianity. Love of man is preached ; but this
is not Christianity. Love of God and faith in his earthly
incarnation is taught ; but this, again, is not Christianity. No
sect has ever formulated as an original doctrine Christ's two indissoluble commandments, on which hang all the law and the prophets.
It would seem, therefore, that to inculcate active kindness,
simple morality, and the simplest creed were the most persuasive means of converting the Hindu, if the teacher unite with
this a practical affection, without venturing upon ratiocination, and without seeking to attract by display, which at best cannot compete with native pageants.^ Moreover, on the basis of undogmatic teaching, the missionary even now can unite with
the Samaj and Sittar church, neither of which is of indigenous origin, though both are native in their secondary growth. For
it is significant that it is the Christian union of morality and altruism which has appealed to each of these religious bodies, and which each of them has made its own. In insisting upon a strict morality the Christian missionary will be supported by the purest creeds of India itself, by Brahmanism, unsectarian
Hinduism, the Jain heretics, and many others, all of whom
either taught the same morality before Christianity existed, or developed it without Christian aid. The strength of Christian
teaching lies in uniting with this the practical altruism which was taught by Christ. In her own religions there is no hope for India, and her best minds have renounced them. The
1 We question, for instance, tlie advisability of sucli means to " fill up the church " as is described in a missionary report delivered at the last meeting of the Missionary Union of the Classis of New York for the current year : " A man is sent to ride on a bicycle as fast as he can through the different streets. This invariably attracts attention. Boys and men follow him to the church, where it is easy to persuade them to enter." But this is an admission of our position in regard to the classes affected. The rabble may be Christianized by this means, but the intelligent will not be attracted.



INDIA AND THE WEST. 571
body of Hinduism is corrupt, its soul is evil. As for Brah
manism — the Brahmanism that produced the Upanishads the spirit is departed, and the form that remains is dead. But
a new spirit, the spirit of progress and of education, will pre
vail at last. When it rules it will undo the bonds of caste and do away with low superstition. Then India also will be free
to accept, as the creed of her new religion, Christ's words, ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and thy neighbor as thyself.' But to educate India up to this point will take many centuries, even more, perhaps, than will be needed to educate in the same degree Europe and America.^
1 After the greater part of our work had passed the final revision, and several months after the whole was gone to press, appeared Oldenberg's Die Religion des Veda, which, as the last new book on the subject, deserves a special note. The author here takes a liberal view, and does not hesitate to illustrate Vedic religion with the Ught cast by other forms of superstition. But this method has its dangers, and there is perhaps a little too much straining after original types, giant-gods as prototypes and totemism in proper names, where Vedic data should be separated from what may have preceded Vedic belief. Oldenberg, as a ritualist, finds in Varuna, Dawn, and the Burial Service the inevitable stumbling-blocks of such scholars as confuse Brahmanism with early Vedism. To remove these obstacles he suggests that Varuna, as the moon, was borrowed from the Semites or Akkadians (though he frankly admits that not even the shadow of this moon lingers in Vedic belief) ; explains Dawn's non-participation in soma by stating that she never participates in it (which explains nothing) ; and jumps over the Burial Hymn with the inquiry whetlier, after all, it could not be interpreted as a cremation-hymn (the obvious answer being that the service does imply burial, and does not even hint at cremation). On the other hand, when theoretical barbarism and ritualism are foregone, Oldenberg has a true eye for the estimation of facts, and hence takes an unimpeachable position in several important particulars, notably in rejecting Jacobi's date of the Rig Veda
;
in rejecting also Hillebrandt's moon-soma ; in denying an originally supreme Dyaus
;
in his explanation of henotheism (substantially one with the explanation we gave a year ago) ; and in his account of the relation of the Rig Veda to the (later) Atharvan. Despite an occasional brilliant suggestion, which makes the work more exciting than reliable, this book will prove of great value to them that are particularly interested in the ritual ; though the reader must be on his guard against the substitution of deduction for induction, as manifested in the confusion of epochs, and in the tendency to interpret by analogy rather than in accordance with historical data. The worth of the latter part of the book is impaired by an unsubstantiated theory of sacrifice, but as a whole it presents a clear and valuable view of the cult.

Rhys Davids in his recent lectures, traces of mysticism are found in some of the early texts (as yet unpublished). The fact that the canonical Pali books know nothing of the controversy (involving the modification of traditional rules) of the "second council gives a terminus to the canon. Senart, on the other hand, thinks that the vague language of the Agoka inscriptions precludes the fixing of the canon at so early a date. Page 340, note 4 : The gods here are priests. The real meaning seems to be that the Brahman priests, who were regarded as gods, -have been put to naught in being reduced to their true estate. Compare Senart, (revised) Inscriptions de Piyadasi, third chapter. Agoka dismissed the Brahman priests that his father had maintained, and substituted Buddhist monks. Page 436, note 2 : From Beruni it would appear that the Gupta and Valabhi eras were identical (319-20 a.d). See Fleet, Indian Antiquary, xvii. 245. Many scholars now assign Kumarila to the eighth century rather than to the end of the seventh.

1 The statement is here made that the Vedic religion knows nothing of idols ; but see the other cited works which seem to disprove this. 2 The ' Fifteen Puzzle' is Indic (I A. a. Sg, xi. 83). 3 Triton und Euphemos, oder Die Argonauten in Libyen, by Water, in 1849, treats of the holy seven in a ridiculous way. Not less ridiculous is the author's attempt to explain everything by the Moon-Cult, thus anticipating modern vagaries.

Colebrook's Essays ; Wilson, Buddha and Buddhism, JRAS., 1856, pp. 229, 357; Bennett, Gaudama,JAOS. ii. 3; R. Spence Hardy, Eastern Monarchism and Manual of Buddhism ; E. Hardy, Der Buddhismus nach alteren Paliwerken ; Burnouf, Le Lotus de la Bonne Loi and Introduction k I'histoire du Bouddhisme indien (Nepal); Koppen, Die Religion des Buddha; Weber, Ueber den Buddhismus, Ind. Skizzen, and .Streifen, i. 104 ; Barth^lemy Saint-Hilaire, Le Bouddha et sa religion (now antiquated); Oldenberg, Buddha; Kern, Der Buddhismus; T. W. Rhys Davids, Manual of Buddhism, and Hibbert Lectures ; Copleston, Buddhism; Monier Williams, Buddhism;^ Mary Sumner's
1 Of the many manuals we recommend especially those of Rhys Davids for ontology (also Jatakas, First Part) and Oldenberg (now in second edition). For Northern Buddhism Koppen's Religion is still excellent, although it is vitiated by the point of view talcen by the author, who regards Buddha as an emancipator, a political innovator, etc. Davids has two recent articles on^Buddhist sects, JRAS. xxiii. 409 ; xxiv. 1 (see also below).

The Indian travels of ApoUonius of Tyana, JRAS. 1859, p. 70, etc., are of no value beside those of Ktesias and Megasthenes. The origin of the Hindu Alphabet and the native system of Dates have to do with the originality of parts of Hindu literature, but these outlying subjects, which have a literature of their own, we can only touch upon.

A SERIES OK
HANDBOOKS ON THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS.
Edited by MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D.,
Professor of Semitic Languages at the University of Pennsylvania,
The historical study of religions has secured a foothold in both European and
American Universities, and the number of institutions that are making ampler provisions for its pursuit is steadily increasing. At the same time, the investigations of scholars on both sides of the Atlantic during the past decades have not only been productive of signincant results, but have also led to a greater degree
of perfection in the methods of study. With a view of illustrating these modern methods of study and of compiling the ascertained results of scholarship, it is proposed to issue a series of Handbooks, dealing with the various religions, that
may serve the purpose at once of practical text and reference books. The dis
tinguishing features of this Series will be: (i) Each volume dealing with the history of a special religion is to be entrusted to the hands of a competent specialist ; (2) \\'ith a view of securing the unity of the series, the treatment of the subject in the various volumes will follow so far as possible a uniform order. Each volume will accordingly begin with an introductory chapter setting forth the sources for the study. This will be followed by a section on the land and people under consideration. The third division, forming, as it were, the kernel of the book, will embody a full exposition of the beliefs and rites, the religious art and literature, set forth in each case in the manner best adapted to the
reUgion in question. A forth division will give the history of the rehgion, and set forth its relation to others ; and, lastly, each volume will be supplied with a substantial Bibliography, with indexes and maps, and, so far as necessary, illustrations. (3) Polemical discussion will be rigidly excluded, the subject being viewed from the historical side exclusively. (4) For the present, the series
will be confined to the ancient and non-Christian religions. Each volume will contain about 350 pages, and the average price will be Si. 5°.
The first volume, however, embracing as it does a larger field than any of the other topics arranged for, is exceptionally large, and the price consequently is above the average for the series. It was thought best, however, to include the material in one volume rather than to issue it in two separate volumes. '
