pictographs of Indus Script are metalwork clusters, wealth accounting classifiers
Discovery of tin-bronzes was momentous in progressing the Bronze Age Revolution of 4th millennium BCE. This discovery created hard alloys combining copper and tin. This discovery was also complemented by the discovery of writing systems to trade in the newly-produced hard alloys.The discovery found substitute hard alloys, to overcome the scarcity of naturally occurring arsenical copper or arsenical bronzes. The early hieroglyph signifiers of tin and copper on an ivory comb made by Meluhha artisans & seafaring merchants point to the contributions made by Bhāratam Janam (RV), ca. 3300 BCE to produce tin-bronzes. The abiding significance of the 'dotted circle' is noted in the continued use on early Punch-marked coins.
The dotted circle as a signifier of interactions between Meluhha and Gonur Tepe has been brilliantly analysed in the context of the following artifacts cited by Dennys Frenez in: Manufacturing and trade of Asian elephant ivory in Bronze Age Middle Asia. Evidence from Gonur Depe (Margiana, Turkmenistan) by Dennys Frenez (2017) https://www.academia.edu/34596109/Manufacturing_and_trade_of_Asian_elephant_ivory_in_Bronz e_Age_Middle_Asia._Evidence_from_Gonur_Depe_Margiana_Turkmenistan https://tinyurl.com/y93voqz8
Trefoil motifs are carved on the robe of the so-called "priest-king" statuette from Mohenjo-daro and are also known from contemporary sites in western Pakistan, Afghanistan, and southern Central Asia.dhā̆ vaḍ 'smelter' tri-dhAtu,'‘three minerals". त्रिधातु mfn. consisting of 3 parts , triple , threefold (used like Lat. triplex to denote excessive)RV.

This may indicate three forms of ferrite ores: magnetite, haematite, laterite which were identified in Indus Script as poLa 'magnetite', bichi 'haematite' and goTa 'laterite'.
Rebus readings of Indus Script hieroglyphs may explain the त्रिधातुः epithet of Gaṇeśa: karibha 'elephant's trunk' rebus: karba 'iron' ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'.
It has been suggested at http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/11/trefoil-of-indus-script-corporaand.html?view=sidebar that the trefoil decorating the shawl of the 'priest-king' of Mohenjo-daro is a cross-sectional signifier of three strands of rope.

Thus, a dotted circle is signified by the word: dhāī 'wisp of fibre' (Sindhi). Single strand (one dotted-circle)
Two strands (pair of dotted-circles)
Three strands (three dotted-circles as a trefoil)
These orthographic variants provide semantic elucidations for a single: dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'red stone mineral' or two minerals: dul PLUS dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'cast minerals' or tri- dhātu, -dhāū,
dhāv 'three minerals' to create metal alloys'. The artisans producing alloys are dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻa caste of iron -- smeltersʼ, dhāvḍī ʻcomposed of or relating to ironʼ)(CDIAL 6773).
dām 'rope, string' rebus: dhāu 'ore' rebus: मेढा [mēḍhā] A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or snarl (Marathi). Rebus: meḍ 'iron, copper' (Munda. Slavic) mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Munda). Semantics of single strand of rope and three strands of rope are: 1. Sindhi dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ, Lahnda dhāī ̃ id.; 2. tridhāˊtu -- ʻ threefold ʼ (RigVeda)
I suggest that this fillet (dotted circle with a connecting strand or tape is the hieroglyph which signifies धात (Rigveda) dhāu (Prakrtam) 'a strand' rebus: element, mineral ore. This hieroglyph
signifies the पोतृ,'purifier' priest of dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron-smelters' of dhāū, dhāv 'red stone minerals'. http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/11/priest-of-dhavad-iron-smelters-with.html Orthography of the 'dotted circle' is representation of a single strand: dhāu rebus: dhāū 'red stone minerals.

I suggest that the expression dhā̆ vaḍ 'smelter' signified by trefoil or three strands is a semantic duplication of the parole words: dhāī 'wisp of fibre' PLUS vaṭa, vaṭara, vaṭi string, rope, tie. Thus, it is possible that the trefoil as a hieroglyph-multiplex was signified in parole by the expression dhā̆ vaḍ 'three strands' rebus: dhā̆ vaḍ 'smelter'.
The shawl decorated with dhā̆ vaḍ 'trefoil' is a hieroglyph: pōta 'cloth' rebus: पोता पोतृ, 'purifier' in a yajna. ப ோற்றி pōṟṟi, ப ோத்தி pōtti Brahman temple- priest in

Indus Script hypertext evidence from Gonur Tepe, Tell Abraq, Mohenjo-daro include the following; both relate to documented accounting ledgers of Tin-Bronze Age metalwork:
1.Hieroglyph of tabernae montana on an ivory comb, on a bronze axe 2.Hieroglyph of dotted circles on ivory combs and on ivory artifacts

It is clear from the evidence that there was diffusion of metallurgical technologies between Meluhha artisans and Ancient Near East artisans.
The hypertexts signify:
tabar = a broad axe (Punjabi). Rebus: tam(b)ra ‘copper’ tagara ‘tabernae montana’, ‘tulip’. Rebus: tagara ‘tin’.
Terracotta sivalinga, Kalibangan.Shape of polished lingam found at Harappa is like the summit of Mt. Kailas, Himalayas. Plate X(c), Lingam in situ in trench Ai (MS Vats, 1940, Exxcavations at Harappa, Vol. II, Calcutta). In trenches III and IV two more stone lingams were found. (MS Vats, opcit., Vol. I, pp. 51-52). The Hindu traditional metaphor of s'iva is the glacial river Ganga emerging from locks of his hair as he sits in penance on summit of Mt. Kailas, Himalayas. The metaphor results in Kailas in Ellora, showing Ravana lifting up the mountain
Two examples from Indus Script Corpora demonstrate that the 'signs' 'ligatured signs' and pictorial motifs (field symbols) are all hieroglyphs deployed to composed Indus Script Hypertexts in Meluhha to document wealth-producing metalwork activitries.

The Pali expression usu -- kāraṇika -- m. ʻ arrow -- maker ʼ provides the semantics of the word kāraṇika as relatable to a 'maker' of a product. usu-kāraṇika is an arrow-maker. Thus,
kuTi kāraṇika can be explained as a smelter-maker. Supercargo is a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale. The Marathi word for Supercargo is: kārṇī . Thus, it can be suggested that kuTi kāraṇika was an ovrseer of the cargo (from smelter) on a merchantship. In the historical periods, the Supercargo has specific duties "The duties of a supercargo are defined by admiralty law and include managing the cargo owner's trade, selling the merchandise inports to which the vessel is sailing, and buying and receiving goods to be carried on the return voyage...A new supercargo was always appointed for each journey who also had to keep books, notes and ledgers about everything that happened during the voyage and trade matters abroad. He was to present these immediately to the directors of the Company on the ship's return to its headquarters ." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercargo While a captain was in charge of navigation, Supercargo was in charge of trade.

Indus Script Scribes kāraṇikā कारत्रणका document in HTTP the world's first accounting system on 8000+ inscriptions to create wealth of a nation https://tinyurl.com/y9h44pbh
Decipherment of Indus Script poses a challenge to historians and students of civilization studies to document the economic history along an Ancient Maritime Tin Route which predated Silk Road by two millennia, creating Arthaśāstra, study of the wealth of a nation. The Tin Route spans -- along the Indian Ocean Rim and Himalayan and Ancient Near Eastern navigable, riverine waterways -- a maritime regime ranging from Hanoi (Vietnam) to Haifa (Israel).
Indus Script Scribes are 4th millennium BCE कारत्रणका arbiters of metalwork wealth-accounting system symbolised by hieroglyph tagaraka tabernaemontana leguminous shrub. This tagaraka hieroglyph is documented on a potsherd dated to ca.3300 BCE at Harappa, signifying the world's early writing system for a wealth-acounting system for a hypertext read rebus: tagara kolami 'tin smithy, forge'. The signifier of a smithy is a hieroglyph composed of three long linear
strokes. Sign 102 which reads: kolom 'three' rebus: kolami 'smithy, forge'. Thus, smithy, forge is identified as a cluster subset. This cluster subset hieroglyph of Sign 102 'three' explains why tabernae montana hieroglyph is repeated thrice on the porsherd. The larger sets of wealthcreating metalwork are signified by over 100 field symbols which accompany such ciphertexts of accounting category clusters.



9
These larger sets of over 100 field symbols documented on Indus Script are presented in a separate addendum monograph supported by 1. over 1150 monographs at https://independent.academia.edu/SriniKalyanaraman and 2. over 8000 semantic clusters of Bhāratīya sprachbund (speech union) in Indian Lexicon of over 25+ ancient languages. 3. over 8000 Indus Script inscriptions presented in 3 volumes of Epigraphia Indus Script, Hypertexts and Meanings (2017)
The thesis of this monograph is that Indus Script Scribes are कारत्रणका teachers, arbiters of metalwork wealth-accounting system. This is demonstrated in the context of the साुंगड sāṅgaḍa system of cataloguing which is a 4th millennium BCE innovation of a wealthaccounting ledger entry system to document economic and mercantile transactions.
The underlying sign design principle साुंगड sāṅgaḍa 'joined parts' is HTTP hypertext transfer protocol. A hypertext on an Indus Script inscription is composed of hieroglyphs joined together which are classified as both composite 'signs' and composite 'field symbols', for e.g.,: 1. on field



10
symbols with composite animals such as hieroglyphs of a bovine body with bos indicus (zebu horns), ram (hoofs), cobrahood (tail), elephant trunk, human face, scarfs on
neck,; and 2. on texts with hypertexts wich are composite hieroglyphs such as a water-carrier hieroglyph superscripted by a rim-of-jar hieroglyph.
It is indeed surprising that this design principle of Indus Script of the 4th millennium BCE is the underlying principle of the modern-day internet of things, cryptographic and computing systems with transmissions of overlaid texts, images, voice/video.

Using partition-based clustering (K-means algorithm) to analyse Indus Script texts, Nisha Yadav et al identify the following dominant (high-frequency occurrence) clusters. The cluster analysis is based on a subset of inscriptions. The number of texts included in a computer corpus called EBUDS is 1548. This is a filtered corpus excluding duplicates and ambiguous texts.EBUDS identifies 377 distinct signs. Strings of sign images are read from right to left. The statistical approach in creating EBUDS is detailed in: Yadav, N., Vahia, M. N., Mahadevan, I. and Joglekar, H. 2008. A Statistical Approach for Pattern Search in Indus Writing. International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics. vol. XXXVII, pp. 39-52.
These 45 Semantic clusters of metalwork wealth-accounting are valided in a monograph Table 6 which lists 45 triplets of signs, which are of frequent occurrence.

At the outset, congratulations to Nisha Yadav, Ambuja Salgaonkar, and Mayank Vahia for this lucid, preciselypresented, outstanding contribution which validates the decipherment of the Indus Scipt Cipher as a cataloguing, sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' rebus: samgraha, samgaha 'catalogue,list, arranger, manager' -- an accounting classification of ledgers for wealth accounting during the Tin-Bronze Revolution, 4th millennium BCE.

Thesis of the monograph: Indus Script Field symbols are accounting ledger classifications of wealth categories, classified as metalwork.
This thesis is validated by a Cluster analysis of 33 sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' Indus Script Field symbols evidences samgaha wealth categories for accounting ledgers, samgaha 'catalogue, list, arranger, manager'. The cargo listed in samgaha are inscribed -- as Indus Script inscriptions -- for delivery by જંગડિયો jangaḍiyo 'military guard who accompanies treasure into the treasury' (Gujarati) --in mercantile transactions on jangaḍ ,'invoiced on approval basis'. This mercantile process explains the repeated and frequent deployment of sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' princple of writing system for both 'signs' and 'field symbols'.

Executive Summary
The cluster analysis presented in this monograph identify superstructures of wealth categories to
which the ‘triplets of signs’ are substructures. The study suggests that there are 33 distinct structures relatedto wealth categories of metalwork to document work on: 1. Minerals; 2. Smelting; 3. Use of furnaces to create alloys by mixing minerals or infusing carbon element through carburization processes; smithy, forge work; 4. Forging of implements, tools, metalware; 5. Metalcasting, including cire perdue (lost-waxmethods) of metal casting; 6. Organization in guilds of artisans/seafaring merchants.
The following 38 categories of wealth accounting ledgers are identified by cluster analysis
Cluster 1 Eagle in flight cluster, thunderbolt weapon, blacksmith classifier Cluster 2 Metallurgical invention of aṅgāra carburization, infusion of carbon element to harden molten metal Cluster 3 Svastika cluster, zinc wealth category Cluster 4 Ficus clusters, copper wealth category Cluster 5 Tiger cluster, smelter category Cluster 6 Spearing a bovine cluster, smelter work Cluster 7 A metallurgical process narrative in four clusters -- four sides of a tablet: Cluster 8 Seafaring boat cluster, cargo wealth category Cluster 9 Bier cluster, wheelwright category Cluster 10 Sickle cluster, wheelwright category Cluster 11 Sun's rays cluster, gold wealth category Cluster 12 Body of standing person cluster, element classifier Cluster 13 Frog cluster, ingot classifier Cluster 14 Serpent cluster as anakku, 'tin ore' classifier Cluster 15 Tortoise, turtle clusters, bronze classifiers Cluster 16 Seated person in penance, mint classifier Cluster 17 Archer cluster, mint classifier Cluster 18 ayakara 'metalsmith' cluster, alloy metal smithy, forge classifier Cluster 19 Smelter cluster, wealth-category of smelted mineral ores Cluster 20 Magnetite, ferrite ore cluster wealth-category or wealth-classification Cluster 21 Dhokra 'cire perdue' metal cassting artisans classifier Cluster 22 dhāvḍī ʻcomposed of or relating to ironʼ, dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron-smelters' cluster, Iron, steel product cluster Cluster 23 Endless knot cluster, yajña dhanam, iron category, ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’ category Cluster 24 Dance-step cluster, iron smithy/forge Cluster 25 Minerals Smelter, metals furnace, clusters Cluster 26 Armoury clusters Cluster 27 Double-axe cluster, armourer category Cluster 28 Seafaring merchant clusters Cluster 29 Smithy, forge clusters Cluster 30 Equipment making blacksmithy/forge Cluster 31 Tin smithy, forge clusters Cluster 32 Alloy metal clusters Cluster 33 Metal equipment, product clusters -- Metalwork samgaha, 'catalogues' cluster सं-ग्रह complete enumeration or collection , sum ,

Cluster 37 Indus Script inscriptions on ivory artifacts signify metalwork wealth accounting Cluster 38 Diffusion of Metallurgy: Meluhha and western Afghanistan sources of tin
This accounting classification of metalwork wealth categories is consistent with the finding that the writing system with a recognized pattern of clustering pictorial motifs was consistently used over the entire gamut of contact areas of Sarasvati civilization. Decipherment of the hieroglyph components of field symbols yields the semantic structure of underlying Meluhha speech in Bhāratīya sprachbund(Speech union).
The total number of objects on M Corpus with distinct, unambiguous pictorials or field symbols is 1894. It is unfortunate that most decipherment claims ignore an analysis of this dominant portion of the documented evidence of the civilization. Some brush them aside as 'cult symbols', some say they are 'religious symbols'.
A cluster analysis of these 1894 Indus Script Field symbols has also been ignored by the cluster analysis of triplets of 'signs' done by K-means by Nisha Yadav et al. I submit that pictorial motifs or field symbols are integral parts of the hypertext messaging system of the Indus Script inscriptions. It should be noted that these pictorial motifs or field symbols occupy the major portion of the space for messaging used on an inscribed object in Indus Script Corpora (which now total over 8000 inscriptions).
This demonstrable laxity in most decipherment claims or cluster analyses is governed by a hypothesis of the 'text' as the writing system, and perhaps ignoring the field symbol or pictorial motifs are extraneous to the messaging system.
I submit that the field symbols or pictorial motifs are the dominant classifiers of the Indus accounting system to identify distinct wealth-accounting category ledgers to document the wealth of a guild of artisans and seafaring merchants. This monograph demonstrates the semantic structure of the field symbols or pictorial motifs in the framework of the principal design principle of the script (which applies to both 'signs' and 'field symbols') which is: sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' rebus: samgraha, samgaha 'catalogue, list, arranger, manager' jangaḍ ,'invoiced on approval basis' - an accounting classification of ledgers for wealth accounting during the Tin-Bronze Revolution, 4th millennium BCE. This sāṅgāḍī 'joined parts' principle of writing system design explains why animal parts are joined together to create 'fabulour' or 'composite' animal pictorial motifs or field symbols.

Impression of a cylinder seal, unknown Near Eastern Origin. Louvre Museum. FS 117 In the upper regiMer from R.-: person grappling with two animals (tigers); a horned personage standing behind a pedestal; a kinn tree; In the lower register from R.-a bird in flight over a unicorn : an antelope: two horned bulls facingeach other and a cicle (dotted?)
Indus Script inscription, message: Brassworker's guild, smelter metalwork catalogue, pewter, laterite castings, hard alloys, implements, smithy/forge working in iron, lead, metal hard alloys.
Copyrighted photo by M. Chuzeville for the Departement des antiquites orientales, Musee du Louvre. "One of the two anthropomorphic figures carved on this seal wears the horns of water buffalo while sitting on a throne with hoofed legs, surrounded by snakes, fishes and water buffaloes. Copyrighted photo by M. Chuzeville for the Departement des antiquites orientales, Musee du Louvre." http://www.akhabataku.com/IndusScript.htm (After Fig. 6)
Hieroglyph multiplexes of the hypertext of the cylinder seal from a Near Eastern Source can be identified: aquatic bird, rhinoceros, buffalo, buffalo horn, crucible, markhor, antelope, hoofed stool, fish, tree, tree branch, twig, roundish stone, tiger, rice plant.
Hieroglyph components on the head-gear of the person on cylinder seal impression are: twig, crucible, buffalo horns: kuThI 'badari ziziphus jojoba' twig Rebus: kuThi 'smelter';koThAri 'crucible' Rebus: koThAri 'treasurer'; tattAru 'buffalo horn' Rebus: ṭhãṭhāro 'brassworker'. koD 'horns' rebus: koD 'workshop'. Thus, the gypertext message is: a brassworker's workshop with a smelter.
This hieroglyph multiplex ligatures head of an antelope to a snake: nAga 'snake' Rebus:nAga 'lead' PLUS karaḍū or ṅkaraḍēṃ ] n A kid. कराडू ुं (p. 137) [ karāḍūṃ ] n (Commonly करडू ुं ) Akid.



48
(Marathi) Rebus: करडा (p. 137) [ karaḍā ]'hard alloy' ranku 'antelope' Rebus:ranku 'tin'. tuttināgamu is a Prakritam gloss meaning 'pewter, zinc'. A comparable alloy may be indicated by the hieroglyph-multiplex of antelope-snake: rankunAga, perhaps a type of zinc or lead alloy.
Two fish hieroglyphs flank the hoofed legs of the stool or platform signify: warehouse of cast metal alloy metal implements:
khuṭo ʻleg, footʼ. khũṭ ‘community, guild’ (Santali)Ta. kuracu, kuraccai horse's hoof. Ka. gorasu, gorase, gorise, gorusu hoof. Te. gorija, gorise, (B. also) gorije, korije id. / Cf.

Turner, CDIAL, no. 3730, kṣurapra- ('scraper'-meanings). (DEDR 1771)
Hieroglyph: kaṇḍō a stool Rebus: kanda 'implements' Hieroglyph: maṇḍā 'raised platform, stool' Rebus: maṇḍā 'warehouse'.
dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' ayo 'fish' Rebus: aya 'iron' (Gujarati) ayas 'metal' (Rigveda) barad, barat 'ox' Rebus: भरत (p. 603) [ bharata ] n A factitious metal compounded of copper, pewter, tin &c.(Marathi).
This mkultiplx is flanked by 1. kolom 'rice plant' Rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'; 2. kuTi 'tree' Rebus: kuThi 'smeter'. Thus the message is that the warehouse of cast metal alloy metal implements is complemented by a smelter and a smithy/forge -- part of the metalwork repertoire. khuṭo ʻleg, footʼ. khũṭ ‘community, guild’ (Santali)
The hieroglyph-multiplex of a woman thwarting two rearing tigers is also signified on other seals and tablets to signify:
Hieroglyph: kola 'woman' Rebus: kol 'working in iron' dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' PLUS kola 'tiger' Rebus: kolle 'blacksmith'; kolhe 'smelter'; kole.l'smithy, forge'. The kolmo 'rice-plant' Rebus kolimi 'smithy, forge' is a semantic determinant of the cipher: smithy with smelter. taTu 'thwart' rebus: dhatu 'mineral'.



49
Thus, 'mineral smelter'. Together the hieroglyph-multiplex or hypertext of a woman thwarting two tigers signifies: smithy/forge with smelter for dhatu, minerals.
The bottom register of the cylinder seal impression lists the products: smithy/forge forged iron, alloy castings (laterite PLUS spelter), hard alloy implements.
goTa 'roundish stone' Rebus: goTa 'laterite, ferrite ore' 'gold-lace braid' dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' PLUS rãgo 'buffalo' Rebus: rāṅgā 'zinc alloy, spelter, pewter'. Thus, cast spelter PLUS laterite, ferrite ore. markhor PLUS tail miṇḍāl 'markhor' (Tōrwālī) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt,
meḍ 'iron' (Munda.Ho.) koṭe meṛed = forged iron, in contrast to dul meṛed, cast iron (Mundari) PLUS Kur. xolā tail. Malt. qoli id. (DEDR 2135) Rebus: kol 'working in iron' Ta. kol working in iron, blacksmith; kollaṉ blacksmith. Ma. kollan blacksmith, artificer. Ko. kole·l smithy, temple in Kota village.
Rhinoceros PLUS eagle aśan, śyena, sena 'eagle' rebus: sena 'thunderbolt' ahan 'blacksmith' PLUSkhamba 'wing' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint'.
Hieroglyhph: kāṇṭā 'rhinoceros. gaṇḍá m. ʻ rhinoceros ʼ Rebus: kāṇḍa 'tools, pots and pans and metal-ware' (Gujarati)
Two water-buffalos flanks a hieroglyph: something round, like a seed. Hieroglyph: rãgo 'buffalo' Rebus: rāṅgā 'zinc alloy, spelter, pewter'. What does the hieroglyph 'something round' signify? I suggest that it signifies goṭa 'round pebble' rebus: goṭa 'laterite (ferrous ore)'.
Orthographic variants of tails of 'animal' hieroglyphs, particularly those of ram or antelope are deciphered as rebus-metonymy layered Meluhha (Proto-Prakritam) words related to blacksmithy or smelters of iron and other metals including metal infusion and cire perdue lost-wax castings. The 'tail' hieroglyh also gets normalised as a sign on texts to connote kolA 'tail' Rebus: kolhe 'smelter' kolle 'blacksmith'.
Some hieroglyph components are: hooded snake or short-tail generally on antelopes.

Mark Kenoyer writes that "discoveries of this motif on seals from Mohenjo-daro definitely show a male figure and most scholars have assumed some connection with the carved seals from Mesopotamia that illustrate episodes from the famous Gilgamesh epic. The Mesopotamian motifs show lions being strangled by a hero, whereas the Indus narratives render tigers being strangled by a figure, sometime clearly males, sometimes ambiguous or possibly female. This motif of a hero or heroine grappling with two wild animals could have been created independently for similar events that may have occurred in Mesopotamia as well as the Indus valley," ( Ancient Cities, p. 114).
Mohenjo-daro seal. Mohenjo-daro, ca. 2500 BCE Asko Parpola writes: "The 'contest' motif is one of the most convincing and widely accepted parallels between Harappan and Near Eastern glyptic art. A considerable number of Harappan seals depict a manly hero, each hand grasping a tiger by the throat. In Mesopotamian art, the fight with lions and / or bulls is the most popular motif. The Harappan substitution of tigers for lions merely reconciles the scene with the fauna of the Indus Valley ... The six dots around the head of the Harappan hero are a significant detail, since they may correspond to the six locks of hair characteristic of the Mesopotamian hero, from Jemdet Nasr to Akkadian times," (Deciphering the Indus Script, pp. 246-7).

Meiolania ("small roamer") is an extinct genus of cryptodire
turtle from the Oligocene to Holocene, with the last relict populations at New Caledonia which survived until 2,000 years ago.
The animal was rather large, measuring 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) in length, making it the second-largest known nonmarine turtle or tortoise, surpassed only by Colossochelys atlas from Asia, which lived in the Pleistocene. It lived in Australia and New Caledonia. Remains have also been found on the island of Efate in Vanuatu, associated with settlements from the Lapitaculture...When the first fossil remains (a vertebra) were found, they were originally thought to be from a large monitor lizard, similar to, but smaller than Megalania, so the genus was named accordingly. Later, when more remains were found, it was realized that the "small roamer" was actually a turtle, and not a lizard. Synonyms include Miolania and Ceratochelys."

There are examples of copper plates with the pictorial motifs of large turtles combined back to back, as a pair to signify: dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting'.

Indus Script Corpora evidence points to the early working with magnetite, ferrite ore as seen by the signifier hieroglyph पोळ pōḷa, 'bos indicus, zebu'. The prologue dedication is first to this bos
indicussignified by the synonym: Nanda, nandi. The word नाुंदी nāndī signifies prologue dedication.
पोळ (p. 305) pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, marked with a trident and discus, and set at large.
Rebus: पोळ pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'. As eulogium or praise of the divine, the synonym used
is: नुंदी (p. 256) nandī m (S) The bull on which Mahádeva rides. A stone-bull is fixed in front of all temples to Mahádeva. The word nanda has specific meanings in the context of trade transactions. नुंद (p. 256) nanda m नुंदकी f (नुंद was a proper name.) A clandestine or covert term,
amongst dealers and brokers, for दलािी or the fees of brokerage. De- vised to keep the secrets of
trade from the employer of the broker and the mere customer. Its vocabulary is भरका One rupee,

भुंगी Eight, तेवसू or िेवनू Nine, अुंगळू Ten, एकडू Eleven, रे घी Twelve, ठे परू Thirteen, चोपडू Fourteen,
तळी Fifteen. To this last term the first four numerals successively added (the sense of addition being
expressed by तान) form successively 16, 17, 18, 19, as भरका तान तळी अवारू तान तळी, उधानू तान



98
तळी, पोकू तान तळी. काटी stands for 20; then भरका तान काटी, अवारू तान काटी &c. express 21, 22 &c. त्रबटी is 100, ढकार 1000, फाटा is An̤ á, अवारू फाटे Two án̤ ás, मुंगी फाटे Eight án̤ ás, तळी फाटे Fifteen án̤ ás, दकार One án̤ á, चकार Two án̤ ás, पकार Four án̤ ás, टािी Half a rupee. The नुंद
vocabulary however has variations. Expressive of the above account the following अभुंग has been
composed, मळू 5 वदनाचा उधान 3 नेिाचा ॥ अुंगूळू 10 हाताुंचा स्वामी माझा ॥1॥ मगट जयाचा के व- ळ्या 1 आगळी काुंटी 20 पत्रवि तळवटी चरण ज्याचे ॥2॥ ढकार 1000 वदनाचा आिा वणाावया ॥ त्रजव्हा त्याच्या त्रचरल्या वणावेना ॥3॥ शेिी 6 वेडाविी पोकू 4 भौनाविी ॥ अगुंळू मुंत्रग 18 थकिी नकळे त्याुंसी ॥4॥ सद्भावें शरण आवारू 2 जोडू न ॥ खेचरवीसा म्हणे स्वामी माझा ॥5॥. नुंद थाकणें or ठे वणें To make (i. e. obtain) नुंद or secret brokerage.
Another onnotation is a mystical figure of lines drawn on the sacred cloth held at marriages between bride and bridegroom: नुंद (p. 256) nanda m (S) Red lines or figures, esp. the mystical figure called
स्वत्वस्तक , drawn on the अुंतुःपट or cloth which, at marriages, is held between the bride and
bridegroom. 2 Vertigo incidental to puerperal women. नुंदाचा पासोडा (p. 256) nandācā pāsōḍā m
नुंदाचा शेिा m The अुंतुःपट (cloth held at marriages between the bride and bridegroom) having red
lines or figures drawn over it, esp. the mystical figure called स्वत्वस्तक which is termed
नुंद. नुंदी nandī (Or नुंद) The lines or figures drawn with कुं कूुं &c. upon the अुंतुःपट .
Thus, the terms nanda, nandi get associated with mystic, vikalpa signifiers as in पोळ (p. 305) pōḷa m A bull dedicated to the gods, marked with a trident and discus, and set at large, as a rebus signifier of: पोळ pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'.
While rendering eulogies and prayers to the divine, the oblations are signified as नाुंदीमख nāndīmukha
A set of synonymous words & expressions: नाुंदी (p. 259) nāndī f S Eulogium of a king or praise of a
deity recited in benedictory verses at the opening of a drama &c. नाुंदीमख nāndīmukha n S नाुंदीश्राद्ध
n S Oblations to the manes offered on festal occasions. నాంది (p. 640) nāndi nāndi. [Skt.] n. A preliminary. The exordium, prelude, prologue dedication, or praise of a deity, recited in benedictory verses at the commencement of a religious ceremony or poem. నాందీ యాగము the opening rite.

నంది (p. 626) nandi or నంాకేశ్ది రుడు nandi. [Skt.] n. The name of the bull of Siva. A bull,
వృషభము.
A synonym for 'bull', bos indicus, is: poḷa 'zebu' which is a definitive Indus Script hieroglyph. Rebus signifier of poḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'-- a metalwork for wealth creation by artisans of Sarasvati_Sindhu Civilization. This Indus Script hieroglyph which signifies 'zebu' or poḷa is seen on early inscriptions of Indus Script as on the paintings of Nausharo pots. The bird perched on the shoulder of the zebu painting is black drongo: pōlaḍu, 'black drongo',rebus: pōlaḍ, 'steel', The zebu is tied to a post with a rope to signify: meṛh f. ʻ rope tying oxen to each other and to post on

of the ‘jointed animals’ glyphic composition). kūṭa joining, connexion, assembly, crowd,
fellowship (DEDR 1882) Pa. gotta ‘clan’; Pk. gotta, gōya id. (CDIAL 4279) Semantics of Pkt. lexeme gōya is concordant with Hebrew ‘goy’ in ha-goy-im (lit. the-nation-s). Pa. gotta -- n. ʻ clan ʼ, Pk. gotta -- , gutta -- , amg. gōya -- n.; Gau. gū ʻ house ʼ (in Kaf. and Dard. several other words for ʻ cowpen ʼ > ʻ house ʼ: gōṣṭhá -- , Pr. gūˊṭu ʻ cow ʼ; S. g̠ oṭru m. ʻ parentage ʼ, L. got f. ʻ clan ʼ, P. gotar, got f.; Ku.

Alternative: adar ḍangra ‘zebu or humped bull’; rebus: aduru ‘native metal’ (Ka.); ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’ (H.)
6. The sixth animal can only be guessed. Perhaps, a tiger (A reasonable inference, because the glyph ’tiger’ appears in a procession on some Indus script inscriptions. Glyph: ‘tiger?’: kol ‘tiger’.Rebus: kol ’worker in iron’. Vikalpa (alternative): perhaps, rhinoceros. gaṇḍa ‘rhinoceros’; rebus:khaṇḍ ‘tools, pots and pans and metal-ware’. Thus, the entire glyphic composition of six animals on the Mohenjodaro seal m417 is semantically a representation of a śrḗṇi, ’guild’, a khũ ṭ , ‘community’ of smiths and masons.

Meluhha is the parole (speech form), lingua franca of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization.
These readings of Jiroft hypertexts are premised on the suggested presence of Meluhha speakers of artisan guilds in Halil Rud (Jiroft culture), as explorers for metal resources and producers of metal products to create wealth of their nation or janapada.
Jiroft culture and Harappa culture are cognates: an iconographic comparison reveals the deep roots of Indo-Iranian traditions. See notes on the arrival of Meluhha speakers in Indo-Iranian region.
When a hypertext is presented with a black drongo perched on a zebu (bos indicus), it is not necessary to posit a mythological narrative. Treating this as a hypertext of metaphors rendered rebus in Indus Script Meluhha provides a truthful framework for realizing the meanings of the signifier and the signified in the message. Hieroglyph: black drongo: పోలడు pōlaḍu rebus: पोिाद [ pōlāda ] n ( or P) Steel. पोिादी a Of steel. (Marathi) bulad 'steel, flint and steel for making fire' (Amharic); fūlād 'steel' (Arabic) The Prakritam gloss पोळ [pōḷa], 'zebu' as hieroglyph is read rebus: pōḷa, 'magnetite, ferrous-ferric oxide'; poliya 'citizen, gatekeeper of town quarter'. Thus, the black drongo perched on a zebu, bos indicus as a hypertext signifies: magnetite, ferrite ore and steel.

• A rare white marble cylinder seal from Jiroft. A brand new paper by Massimo Vidale and Dennys Frenez, Indus Components in the Iconography of a White Marble Cylinder Seal from Konar Sandal South (Kerman, Iran) provides a detailed analysis of this seal found at the recently discovered site of Jiroft . Well used, and apparently worn at the wrist, it testifies to the multiple cultural and trade connections between the Indus civilization and its western neighbors. It also suggests many more discoveries and insights into Indus civilization will come from material found at and connected to Jiroft.Read Massimo Vidale's paper Indus Components in the Iconography of a White Marble Cylinder Seal from Konar Sandal South (Kerman, Iran). The first part of the article summarizes what we know about the Jiroft civilization so far, its apparent origins in the late 5th millennium BCE, how it flourished at the height of the Indus civilization, and the tantalizing facts about connections between the two. Could it have been the ancient nation and state of Marhashi/Parahshum about which so little is known but which would have been at the cross-roads of so many cultures? What could have been the function of these so-called whorl seals, only found so far here, at Mohenjo-daro, Allahdino and Kalibangan? • • • •

They are all made of ivory and differ from the cylinder seals of other countries in being very long and thing; nor are they perforated for suspension on a cord. It is possible that these so-called seals are not true seals at all. They incised characters upon them might conceivably be identification marks for a game or something similar. On the other hand, they are certainly suitable for use a seals and in this account they are included in this chapter For the sake of clearness the actual seal is shown side by side with each impression.

It shows a Blackbuck antelope with trefoil design made of combined circle-and-dot motifs, possibly representing stars. It is associated with burial pottery of the Cemetery H period,dating after 1900 BC.The Late Harappan Period at Harappa is represented by the Cemetery H culture (190-1300 BC)

which is named after the discovery of a large cemetery filled with painted burial urns and some extended inhumations. The earlier burials in this cemetery were laid out much like Harappan coffin burials, but in the later burials, adults were cremated and the bones placed in large urns (164). The change in burial customs represents a major shift in religion and can also be correlated to important changes in economic and political organization. Cemetery H pottery and related ceramics have been found throughout northern Pakistan, even as far north as Swat, where they mix with distinctive local traditions. In the east, numerous sites in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab provide evidence for the gradual expansion of settlements into this heavily forested region. One impetus for this expansion may have been the increasing use of rice and other summer (kharif) crops that could be grown using monsoon stimulated rains. Until late in the Harappan Period (after 2200 BC) the agricultural foundation of the Harappan cities was largely winter (rabi) crops that included wheat and barley. Although the Cemetery H culture encompassed a relatively large area, the trade connections with thewestern highlands began to break down as did the trade with the coast. Lapis lazuli and turquoise beads are rarely found in the settlements, and marine shell for ornaments and ritual objects gradually disappeared. On the other hand the technology of faience manufacture becomes more refined, possibly in order to compensate for the lack of raw materials such as shell, faience and possibly even carnelian."
