See some other high-resolution photographs of Queen Pu-abi’s royal
regalia.
When we look at a picture of Pu-abi, we see the beautiful headdress and all
of the jewelry,
but we don’t really see the woman herself. That’s because we know very
little about her,
so it is difficult to imagine who she was, or what she was like.
We know her name only because she was buried with three different
cylinder seals
pinned to her robe. The cylinder seals were used for personal
identification. They include
her name and her royal title (see Footnote 1).
It's unusual for a person to be buried with three cylinder seals, since only
one would suffice.
It seems that Pu-abi had a particular reason for including all three of her
seals.
It was her way of saying, “This is who I am."
This is how she presented herself to the gods in the afterlife.
Pu-abi's cylinder seals:
Taken all together, the cylinder seals show us Pu-abi the way she saw
herself.

from the left.
Pu-abi is wearing a robe. The servants bring wine. Food is available from a
portable pantry.
Female musicians, including a harpist, provide entertainment for the
guests. Pu-abi's chair
is more decorative than the others, indicating that it is a throne.

Here is another banquet scene. Pu-abi is in the top register, third from the
left. The servants bring food and wine.
Pu-abi sits on a throne. We know it's a throne because it is different from
the other chairs.
I suggest this is Pu-abi when she was just a princess, because she has no
other symbols
of rank.
She is drinking beer in the Sumerian fashion, through a long straw. The

straw was used
to avoid the dregs at the bottom of the beer and the bitter foam on top.
Enlarge.
This is yet another banquet scene. Pu-abi sits on a throne, attended by her
female servants
while her male servants tend to the guests. Wine and food are served,
including a roasted
leg of lamb.
Three banquet scenes give the impression that Pu-abi was a regular "party
girl". However, banquet scenes were a common motif on cylinder seals.
Besides, as we will soon see,
there is much more to Pu-abi than meets the eye.
In any case, the three cylinder seals were obviously important to Pu-abi,
since they were pinned to her robe for all eternity.
It's interesting to note that the first two seals have a blank space, but no
name or title is written there. This means they were not official seals that
were used while conducting government business. Instead, the first seal
was used for her personal correspondence.
The second seal is from her younger years, when she was a royal princess.
The third seal is the most important one. This is Pu-abi's official seal.

Who was she?
We know her name, but we know little else about her.

Beneath her elaborate headdress and her splendid cloak of jewels, who
was Pu-abi?
She lived in the first half of the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2600 BC – 2340
BC). It’s believed that she was originally an Akkadian, not a Sumerian, but
this has not been proven (3).
Pu-abi was less than five feet tall and she was about 40 years old when she
died.
That’s the sum total of everything we know about Pu-abi.
We don't know much about her life, but we know a great deal about her
“afterlife”.
Pu-abi was buried in PG 800 (PG means “Private Grave”) in the Royal

Tombs of Ur. She was surrounded by her personal possessions, the richest
ever found in a Sumerian tomb.
Pu-abi lay on a wooden bier, with a gold cup nearby. She wore an
elaborate headdress
and the upper part of her body was entirely hidden by multi-colored
beads.
Buried with Pu-abi were the bodies of 26 attendants, male and female, and
a team of oxen harnessed to a ceremonial sledge.

The tomb chamber containing the bodies of Pu-abi and two of her
attendants is shown
at the top of the drawing. The "Death Pit" (with 24 attendants, a wooden
chest, a sledge,
and a pair of oxen) is shown at the bottom (4).

Tombs of Ur.
Pu-abi: a queen or just a noblewoman?
Pu-abi was obviously a woman of high status, given the wealth and
Queen Pu-abi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1162201/index.html
8 of 23 8/18/2020, 5:14 PM



abundance of her
grave goods and the number of people who were sacrificed to serve her in
the afterlife.
Although Pu-abi was a woman of high status, was she actually a queen?
Pu-abi is commonly called a queen, but we don’t know this for certain.
There has been
a lot of speculation on the subject for the last 100 years. We don’t know for
sure whether
she was queen or just a high-born noblewoman. It has also been
speculated that she was
a high-priestess.
Pu-abi’s official title is written on the upper left corner of her cylinder seal,
so it should be obvious who she is.
Unfortunately, we cannot read the sign because of the vagaries of
Sumerian writing, since all cuneiform signs have multiple meanings and
pronunciations.
This sign can be nin, “a Lady, a titled noblewoman”. It can also be ereš
(pronounced “eresh”) meaning “a queen”.
It means Pu-abi was either a Lady or a queen. As such, she could also be a
Queen Pu-abi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1162201/index.html

high-priestess.
I always thought Pu-abi was all three − a Lady, a priestess, and a queen.
She was certainly
a Lady, a titled noblewoman, when she was a royal princess. She
was probably the wife
of a king, and she was therefore a queen, and she was possibly a high
priestess, since only women of the high nobility were appointed to this
exalted position.
Still, I was merely guessing, just like everyone else. Without any
collaborating evidence,
we cannot be absolutely certain whether the sign means that Pu-abi was a
queen or
just a noblewoman.
A few days ago, I realized there is another way to prove that Pu-abi was
indeed a queen.
Pu-abi, the queen:

This picture and the next paragraph are from a page about the Unknown
Sumerian Queen.
At the banquet, a Sumerian king and queen are attended by their servants.
We know they
are a king and queen, and not just a lord and lady, because both of them
hold date clusters.
As described on a separate page, the date cluster was a symbol of royalty
and the divine right to rule. It was used exclusively by kings and queens.
Mere lords and ladies were not entitled to carry this exalted symbol of
Queen Pu-abi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1162201/index.html

rank.
On the banquet scenes mentioned earlier, none of the lords and ladies
hold a date cluster.
This right was reserved only for kings and queens.
Enlarge.
On a page about A Divine Symbol of Royalty, there are seven examples
that show Sumerian kings and queens at a banquet. It was a common
motif during the Early Dynastic period.
On all the plaques, every king and queen holds a date cluster.
While researching the page about the Unknown Sumerian Queen, I came
across a copy of
Pu-abi’s cylinder seal.
Then I realized something:
I noticed that Pu-abi is holding a date cluster, a symbol of royalty and the
divine right to rule.

This proves beyond a shadow of doubt that Pu-abi was indeed a queen.
This is the collaborating evidence that was needed to confirm the meaning
of the sign
that is written next to her name.
The sign doesn't mean nin, “Lady". It means eresh, “Queen”.
I once wrote, “It is unlikely that Pu-abi was a queen in the modern sense
of the word,
meaning "a ruler", because there aren't any known examples of the
Sumerians being ruled by a woman, although it’s possible that she was the
wife of a ruling monarch,
and thus a queen in that regard.”

I recently had to reconsider my opinion. I now suggest Pu-abi wasn’t just
the wife of a king, she was a reigning queen in her own right.
Pu-abi, a ruling monarch.
Look at this banquet scene.
The king and queen hold date clusters, meaning they are royals. However,
only the queen
is wearing a crown, symbolizing her right to rule. She is also drawn taller
than her husband, symbolizing her greater importance. In fact, she
actually exceeds the border of the frame.
She clearly out-ranks her husband, the king. She is the ruling sovereign in
this picture, not
her husband.
She was a queen in her own right. She wasn’t just the wife of the king, she
was the reigning monarch.
Now look at the seal of Pu-abi.
Pu-abi holds a date cluster, but the man sitting in front of her doesn’t have
one, and he has
Queen Pu-abi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1162201/index.html
13 of 23 8/18/2020, 5:14 PM



no other symbols of rank. This means Pu-abi is a royal, but he is not. He is
definitely
a nobleman (because he is a guest sitting in the presence of the queen
while the servants must remain standing), but he is not a king, he is not
her husband.
Pu-abi is the only sovereign in this picture. We know this because she sits
on a throne,
she wears a regal robe, and she holds a date cluster. This is Eresh Pu-abi,
Queen Pu-abi.
It means Pu-abi wasn’t just a queen by virtue of being married to the king.
She was a queen
in her own right. She ruled the kingdom as the only reigning monarch.
There is something else to be considered...
Pu-abi was less than five feet tall, but she was every inch a queen.
A priestess didn’t dress this way, neither did a noblewoman. Only a queen
dressed this way,
making it impossible for another woman to be attired in greater splendor.

No other woman
could ever out-shine Queen Pu-abi.
Now the question is: How did Pu-abi become the reigning
monarch?
There are two possible scenarios. The first one is the most obvious: She
inherited the crown from her husband.
Scenario 1. Pu-abi, the widow of a king:
It’s been speculated that Pu-abi’s husband was buried in the King’s Grave
(PG 789). It was
a lavish burial, involving the sacrifice of 63 attendants to serve him in the
afterlife. Perhaps
he died before Pu-abi, since her tomb is adjacent to the King's Grave. In
other words,
the king died and Pu-abi became a widow (5).
Enlarge.
This scene occurred moments before the attendants were entombed in the
King's Grave.
Usually, when a king dies, the kingship passes to his son, or to his nearest
male relative,
or to a rival lord who has an army to back up his claim to the throne.
The widow of the dead king usually had only two choices: either forced
retirement if her son
Queen Pu-abi about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1162201/index.html
15 of 23 8/18/2020, 5:14 PM



became the king, or exile if a rival lord took over. A hostile lord may even
execute a queen
and her children to end any pretensions they had about reclaiming the
throne.
Yet somehow Pu-abi managed to hang on to power and become the sole
monarch.
After the king died, probably without a suitable heir (either he had no sons
or they were
too young to rule), Pu-abi defied convention and made her own bid for the
throne. We
cannot be certain how she did this. Perhaps she did some clever backstage
maneuvering
to gain the support of a majority of the rival lords. Perhaps like Catherine
the Great
she appeared before the Imperial Guards and asked for their help. Perhaps
like Hatsheput
she usurped power from her own son who wasn't old enough to rule.
In any case, Pu-abi became the sole ruler of the kingdom after the death of
her husband.
This scenario makes the most sense according to the usual course of
history and the
laws of royal succession.
Nonetheless, this is just speculation. There is no direct evidence to
support it. Perhaps
this scenario makes the most sense, but it cannot be proven.
However, if you look at the available evidence, a different scenario
presents itself:
Pu-abi did not inherit the kingship from her husband, she inherited it
from her father.
Scenario 2. Pu-abi, the daughter of the king.

In all the other banquet scenes, the king and queen are a “royal couple”.
Although a king outranks a queen, pictorially they are shown together as
equals. Both of them are drawn equally tall.
In this banquet scene, the queen's husband is a king, but she clearly
outranks him. She is portrayed taller than him to symbolize her greater
importance. She also wears a crown,
whereas he does not. She is the one with the royal title that gives her the
right to rule.
She did not become a queen by marrying her husband. She was already a
queen, meaning
she inherited the royal title from her father.
On Pu-abi’s seals, there are no kings at all. Pu-abi is never shown in
relation to a king.

Top: The seal of Lady Pu-abi (Nin Pu-abi), the royal princess.
Middle: The personal seal of Queen Pu-abi, the woman herself.
Bottom: The official seal of Queen Pu-abi, the ruling monarch.
These three seals were important to Pu-abi. They were meaningful to her.
That is why they were pinned to her robe when she was buried. If Pu-abi
had ever been married, her husband would appear on at least one of the
seals.
The fact that he doesn't appear means Pu-abi did not inherit the crown
from her husband.
If she did, then her power and her right to rule would derive from her
husband’s royal title.
In this case, her husband would definitely appear as the king on one of the
seals, illustrating the legitimacy and continuity of her own reign.
This is especially true if Pu-abi was originally an Akkadian. As a foreigner,
her right to rule would entirely depend on her marriage to a Sumerian
king.

The fact that her husband the king does not appear suggests he did not
exist − because
Pu-abi never married.
Pu-abi did not inherit the crown from her husband, she inherited it from
her father, and she ruled the kingdom without the aid (or interference) of
a husband.
In this way, Pu-abi was like Elizabeth I of England.
This is shown on her official seal:
There is no king in this picture. It means Pu-abi governed by herself. In
effect, she was
the king. She alone ruled the kingdom, just like Elizabeth.
It is said that Pu-abi's name means "word of the father". If true, this is Pu
abi's justification
for her right to rule. She is the sole successor to her father, the king.
Pu-abi was also a high-priestess. As described on a separate page, every
Sumerian queen
was the high-priestess of an important temple. This also gave the queens
an aura of divinity.
Speaking of which...
Pu-abi, the goddess.
It has never been mentioned before, but the fact that human beings were
sacrificed to serve Pu-abi in the afterlife indicates that she was a living
goddess. Sumerian kings and queens believed they had a "divine right to
rule". They took this belief literally. The date cluster indicates they were
ordained by the gods to rule. They were either raised to divine rank
by the gods, or they were descended from the gods themselves. That is
why they felt justified in sacrificing mere mortals to serve them in the
afterlife.

There is one more thing to be considered:
Pu-abi, the first female ruler in history?
As a reigning monarch in the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2600 BC – 2340
BC), Pu-abi is possibly the first female ruler in world history. Until
recently, the Akkadian queen Ku-Baba
was considered to be the first female ruler in Mesopotamia (and therefore
in the world).
She is the only female ruler who is officially acknowledged on the
Sumerian King List.
Another possibility for the title of the world's first female ruler is the
woman I call Nin-ensi,
The Unknown Sumerian Queen. She appears several times on this page.
So... who came first?
Ku-Baba died 26 years before the end of the Early Dynastic period. This
means Pu-abi predates Ku-Baba by a considerable margin, perhaps 100
years or more.
The dates given for Nin-ensi are 2700 BC - 2500 BC. I think the dates are
too old. I believe
Nin-ensi lived toward the end of the ED period, making her more or less
contemporary
with Ku-Baba, but perhaps a bit earlier.
So, Pu-abi predates both of them. This makes Pu-abi the first female ruler
in history.
We don’t know how long she ruled, but when Pu-abi died, she died like a
queen.

The funeral procession of Queen Pu-abi.
When Pu-abi was buried, she was surrounded by her riches and she had
many attendants
to serve her in the afterlife.
The opulence of her tomb, and the human sacrifices, are enough to prove
that Pu-abi
was indeed a powerful queen. This was not the burial of a mere
noblewoman.
In conclusion...
Pu-abi’s cylinder seals tell us she was not only a Lady, she was a queen.
She was

not only a queen, she was a ruling monarch. She was not only a ruling
monarch,
she was the first female ruler in all of human history.
The sacrifice of men and women to serve her in the afterlife tells us she
was also a goddess.

abi’s seals,

Although Pu-abi lived and died in the Sumerian city of Ur, it's widely
believed that she was
an Akkadian by birth. It has been suggested that she was part of a
marriage alliance between Sumerian and Akkadian kingdoms.
2) Pu-abi’s name.
Leonard Woolley originally named her Shub-ad. Later scholars revised her
name to Pu-abi, which is an Akkadian name. Other variations of her name
include Pu-abu and Pu-abum.
The correct Sumerian pronunciation of Pu-abi’s name is “Pu-ad”.

Pu3-ad
Left: Pu-abi’s name is on her seal. Right: Pu-abi’s name the way it is
usually written.
On cylinder seals, some cuneiform signs were simplified to make them
easier to engrave.
Pu-abi is an Akkadian name. It is usually interpreted to mean “word of the
father” (although
I have my doubts about it, for grammatical reasons that will take too long
to explain).
This would be an acceptable name if Pu-abi was the daughter of a
Sumerian king. However,
it would be a very unfortunate name if Pu-abi was the daughter of an
Akkadian king.
As a young bride, while Pu-abi was desperately trying to assimilate into
Sumerian society,
she would be known as “Word of my father [the foreign king]”.
3) Pu-abi, an Akkadian?

For some reason, Pu-abi is commonly assumed to be Akkadian. I don’t
know what evidence
is used to support this conclusion, except for the misguided attempt to re
interpret her name.
Otherwise there is no evidence to suggest that Pu-abi was an Akkadian.
Presumably,
she was part of a marriage alliance between Sumerian and Akkadian
kingdoms. Maybe so,
but where is the evidence? All available evidence shows that Pu-abi lived
in a Sumerian city, she wore Sumerian clothes, and she wore her hair in
the Sumerian style. It could be argued that Pu-abi was an Akkadian who
was trying to blend into the social circles of her adopted homeland by
wearing the latest Sumerian fashions. Perhaps... but the simplest
explanation
is that she was a Sumerian to begin with.
Without more evidence, I think it is unreasonable to assume that Pu-abi
was an Akkadian.
4) The Death Pit.
The area outside a tomb where the attendants were sacrificed is called a
“Death Pit”.

PG 800. The tomb of Pu-abi and the death pit. Enlarge.
Modern scholars think the Death Pit that Woolley associated with Pu-abi’s
tomb (PG 800B) may actually belong to a different tomb. That’s because
the death pit and the tomb are not
on the same level, as shown in the drawing below. It’s now believed that
the death pit for
Pu-abi’s tomb was in the area indicated by the dotted lines. Unfortunately,
Woolley did not
excavate this area.
Two of Pu-abi's servants were buried in her burial chamber, so it is
reasonable to assume
that other servants were buried in an outside death pit, similar to the
other Royal Tombs.
It is also possible that the original death pit may indeed belong to Pu-abi,
despite the fact
that it is not on the same level, because there aren't any other large Royal
Tombs next to it (see a map of the area).

5) The King’s Grave.
Leonard Woolley originally believed that Pu-abi’s husband died and was
buried in the
King’s Grave (PG 789). Pu-abi later built her own tomb next to his so the
couple would be together for all eternity. It’s a romantic story that may not
be based on fact. Measurements show Pu-abi’s tomb is 40 cm (16 inches)
lower than the king’s tomb, as shown above, suggesting it was built earlier
than PG 789.
