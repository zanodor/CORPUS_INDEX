Chalcolithic cultures of Southeastern Europe, with major archaeological sites (including typesites) “The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture flourished in the territory of what is now Moldova, eastern and northeastern Romania and parts of Western, Central and Southern Ukraine. The culture thus extended northeast from the Danube river basin around the Iron Gates to the Black Sea and the Dnieper. It encompassed the central Carpathian Mountains as well as the plains, steppe and forest steppe on either side of the range. Its historical core lay around the middle to upper Dniester (the Podolian Upland)”-- Mantu, Cornelia-Magda (2000).

Black Sea area". Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica. Iași, Romania: Iași University. VII: 267.
