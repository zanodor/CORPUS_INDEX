rarely exceed 16 points though those with 18 or more do turn up. So in the UK

benefit of genetics, nutrition and environment producing trophies of up to 15
points and occasionally more than 16 points.

improved or park animals comes into play. These are physically larger than our
natives and have the potential to grow trophies in excess of 18 points. They
usually occur in discrete populations or groups, generally in England. As they
are free-living and come from self-sustaining populations they deserve to be

European as opposed to Scottish, therefore requiring a higher threshold score
when they are evaluated under CIC measurement rules.
