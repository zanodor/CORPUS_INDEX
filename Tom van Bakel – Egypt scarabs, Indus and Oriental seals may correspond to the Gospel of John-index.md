# Index for Tom van Bakel – Egypt scarabs, Indus and Oriental seals may correspond to the Gospel of John.pdf

Egypt scarabs, Indus and Oriental seals may correspond to the Gospel of John
It is clear that in ancient Egypt and in the ancient Near East, the heliacal rising of Sirius in June was an important event. Scarabs and cylinder seals show that during that time marriages were concluded, kings were crowned and officials were appointed. The Egyptians even started a new year when this star became visible again.
But in the Indus Valley Civilization, a new year began in March during the spring equinox when the sun was killed and born again. At the same time the rivers rose, soma was harvested and marriages were celebrated.
I think that the Gospel of John shows something similar, it may have started in Nisan, the first month of the year, then the Word may have become flesh and resided among us. In Nisan Jesus may have been baptized in the Jordan river. And three years later He was crucified in this first month of the year and then He resurrected on Easter.
Before I compare John's gospel with the Enuma Elis I start this essay with a short introduction about scarabs and seals.
Number 1
You may know that the ancient Egyptians based their calendar on the heliacal rising of Sirius, which happened when the sun passed through Cancer and was about to enter Leo:
‘The scholar and Byzantine Princess, Anna Comnena (Komnene), in her large work Alexias (1148) mentions the ‘star of the Dog’:
‘... even though it was summer and the sun had passed through Cancer and was about to enter Leo – a season in which, as they say, the star of the Dog rises ... ‘
(Anna Comnena, 1928, 1969: I, Book 3, II.4). Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage, 14(3), 180-189 (2011).
In that period the sun was born again:
29 July 12 Holiday in the Temple of Sokar; Festival of the Estate of Ptah 30 July 13 Birthday of Ra

Knowing this it becomes clear why on the above image the sun disk was depicted above a dung beetle (in Egypt this insect represented Cancer): because this sun was reborn when it was past Cancer. In this way it looked as if this beetle rolls the sun disk instead of a dung ball.



Number 2
This scarab depicts Sopdet represented as a large dog
At that time the heliacal rising of Sirius occurred just before the summer solstice:
‘Egyptians based their calendar on the heliacal rising of Sirius, namely the day it becomes visible just before sunrise after moving far enough away from the glare of the Sun. This occurred just before the annual flooding of the Nile and the summer solstice, after a 70-day absence from the skies. Sirius was identified with the great goddess Isis, while the 70-day period symbolized the passing of Isis and Osiris through the duat (Egyptian underworld)’.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius
Sopdet was the name of the ‘Dog Star’ (Sirius):
‘Sopdet is the ancient Egyptian name of the star Sirius and its personification as an Egyptian
goddess. Known to the Greeks as Sothis, she was conflated with Isis as a goddess and Anubis as a god’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet
And on the above scarab she was represented as a large dog:
‘She was depicted as a woman with a five-pointed star upon her head, usually with a horned hedjet similar to Satis. In the Ptolemaic and Roman period, the European notion of the ‘Dog Star’ caused her to sometimes be represented as a large dog or as a woman riding one sidesaddle’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet



Number 3
This scarab depicts a winged Isis holding papyrus plants
But in the Ptolemaic period Sopdet and her spouse Sah almost solely appeared in forms conflated with Isis and Osiris’:
‘Sopdet is the consort of Sah, the personified constellation of Orion near Sirius. Their child Venus was the hawk god Sopdu, ‘Lord of the East’. As the ‘bringer of the New Year and the Nile flood’, she was associated with Osiris from an early date and by the Ptolemaic period Sah and Sopdet almost solely appeared in forms conflated with Osiris and Isis’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet
Isis was linked with the flood of the Nile, which was represented by papyrus plants:
‘Many of the roles Isis acquired gave her an important position in the sky. Passages in the Pyramid Texts connect Isis closely with Sopdet, the goddess representing the star Sirius, whose relationship with her husband Sah—the constellation Orion—and their son Sopdu parallels Isis's relations with Osiris and Horus. Sirius's heliacal rising, just before the start of the Nile flood, gave Sopdet a close connection with the flood and the resulting growth of plants. Partly because of her relationship with Sopdet, Isis was also linked with the flood, which was sometimes equated with the tears she shed for Osiris’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis
And the flood of the Nile was sometimes equated with the tears Isis shed for Osiris.

Number 6
This scarab depicts Isis and Osiris
This scarab depicts the divine couple Isis and Osiris. At that time, they celebrated a primal marriage during the Opet festival before the summer solstice (and not on July 19):
‘June 16 (or June 14) Night of the Teardrop, Feast of the Waters of the Nile celebrating Isis and her sorrows June 24 Burning of the Lamps in Egypt at Sais, a celebration of Isis and Neith July 17 Birthday of Isis July 18 Birthday of Nephthys

Isis was the inventor of marriage and parenthood:
‘Elaborating upon Isis's role as a wife and mother in the Osiris myth, aretalogies call her the inventor of marriage and parenthood. She was invoked to protect women in childbirth and, in ancient Greek novels such as the Ephesian Tale, to protect their virginity. Some ancient texts suggested she was the patroness of women in general’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis
And she became humanized and began to wear the insignia of a human queen:
‘Beginning in the New Kingdom, thanks to the close links between Isis and Hathor, Isis took on Hathor's attributes, such as a sistrum rattle and a headdress of cow horns enclosing a sun disk. Sometimes both her headdresses were combined, so the throne glyph sat atop the sun disk. In the
same era, she began to wear the insignia of a human queen, such as a vulture-shaped crown on her head and the royal uraeus, or rearing cobra, on her brow’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis
The next three scarabs are special as they are the birth, coronation and wedding scarab of Amenhotep. They show that the most important events in the live of this pharaoh occurred in June, when the sun went through Khepri.



Number 7
We start with this scarab that bears the birth name of Amenhotep, probably Amenhotep III who has five royal names:
1. ‘His birth name (nomen) was Amenhotep Heqawaset (‘Amun is Pleased, Ruler of Thebes) 2. His throne name (prenomen) was Nub-maat-re (‘Lord of Truth is Re’). 3. He also used the Horus name Kanakht Khaemmaat (‘Strong Bull, Arising in Thebes’), 4. The Nebty name Semenhepusegerehtawy (‘One establishing laws, pacifying the two lands’) 5. And the Golden Horus name Aakhepesh-husetiu (‘Great of valour, smiting the Asiatics’).
https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amenhotepiii/#:~:targetText=His%20birth%20name%20(nomen)%20was,of%20Truth%20is%20Re%E2%80%9D).
His birth name written on this scarab expressed that Amenhotep was engendered in June, probably during the marriage of Isis and Osiris, and about nine months later he may have been born in March.



Number 8
We continue with this scarab that bears the name ‘Nub-Maat-Re’ (‘Lord of Truth is Re’), which is the throne name of Amenhotep III. It was known that the coronation of Amenhotep happened in June in the year 1391 B.C. or in June in the year 1388 B.C.:
‘Amenhotep III (sometimes read as Amenophis III) meaning Amun is Satisfied was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty. According to different authors, he ruled Egypt from June 1391 BCDecember 1353 BC or June 1388 BC to December 1351 BC/1350 BC after his father Thutmose IV died. Amenhotep III was the son of Thutmose IV by Mutemwia, a minor wife of Amenhotep's father’.
https://www.hixenbaugh.net/gallery/detail.cfm?itemnum=6403
So, this scarab confirmed that the pharaoh was crowned in that month and it may have been a keepsake of this event.



Number 9
And this scarab bears the names Neb-maat-ra (the throne name of Amenhotep III) and Queen Tiye. Put together the two names indicate a marriage of the Pharaoh and the Queen. The scarab itself suggested that this marriage was celebrated in June, probably during the Opet festival when Isis and Osiris celebrated their divine marriage:
July 17 Birthday of Isis July 18 Birthday of Nephthys
July 19 Egyptian New Year. The Opet Festival or Marriage of Isis and Osiris July 27 1st Epagomenal Day♦ Birthday of Osiris July 28 2nd Epagomenal Day♦ Birthday of Horus July 29 3rd Epagomenal Day♦ Birthday of Set July 30 4th Epagomenal Day♦ Birthday of Isis July 31 5th Epagomenal Day♦ Birthday of Nephthys August 1 Egyptian New Year August 6 Festival of Thoth August 7 Breaking of the Nile, dedicated to Hathor August 12 The Blessing of the Boats

And thus, this scarab may have been a small keepsake of their Royal Wedding in June.
All in all, on the above scarabs we noticed that Amenhotep III was conceived when the sun had passed through Cancer and that his coronation and wedding with Queen Tiye happened under the same constellation. The next imprints showed that the same phenomenon also occurred in Mesopotamia:



Number 10
Let’s first look at this imprint because here Ishtar stands on a lion. In Mesopotamia she is the Sirius goddess and this imprint shows that when the sun is in Leo, she is the morning star rising above this sun at dawn, (so when the sun still is at the horizon). We saw that in ancient Egypt the heliacal rising of Sirius was related Cancer, but this imprint (and many others) shows that in the ancient Near East it was related to a constellation like Leo:
‘The scholar and Byzantine Princess, Anna Comnena (Komnene), in her large work Alexias (1148) mentions the ‘star of the Dog’:
‘... even though it was summer and the sun had passed through Cancer and was about to enter Leo – a season in which, as they say, the star of the Dog rises ... ‘
(Anna Comnena, 1928, 1969: I, Book 3, II.4). Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage, 14(3), 180-189 (2011).
The next two imprints show that Sirius was also related to the Egypt constellation Wings and other imprints show that it was related to constellations standing close to Leo, like Hydra and Crater.



Number 11
We saw that in Egypt marriages as well as coronations were celebrated when the sun had passed through Cancer. This imprint shows that in the ancient Near East the engendering of the seal owner as well as his appointment as a cup-bearer also happened in the same period, namely when the sun passes Wings:
o On the left a naked man with erect phallus symbolized that he engendered a child. This happened in June indicated by the bird behind him: it symbolized the Egyptian constellation Wings, and at that time the sun passed it in June:
In Egypt the constellations Corvus and Crater were usually known as the constellation ‘The Wings’(tm3t).
http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page11-19.html
o In the middle a god decreed a fate for this child, now grown up, which happened in Wings again. This constellation was also symbolized by a bird looking backwards. (See below.) o On the right, a woman spread her legs to give birth to this child. She wore cow horns symbolizing that she gave birth to him in Taurus. This Zodiac sign then indicated the period March/April.



Number 11
The scene in the middle shows the inauguration of the seal owner as a cup-bearer. The little bird in the middle had two meanings:
o First, it symbolized the Egypt constellation Wings, which indicated that this inauguration happened in June. o Secondly, it symbolized that the seated deity decreed a fate for the seal owner: the Old Babylonian words ‘nam tar’ can be translated as ‘decree fate,’ whereas the word for ‘bird’ is ‘NAMdar.’
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/nepsd-frame.html
‘The augur was a priest and official in the classical world, especially ancient Rome and Etruria. His main role was to interpret the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds: whether they are flying in groups or alone, what noises they make as they fly, direction of flight and what kind of birds they are. This was known as ‘taking the auspices.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury.
o The jar above the hand of the seal owner may have symbolized this fate: the owner of the seal would become a cupbearer of his divine father:
One day, after the evening had arrived and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace, Ur-Zababa was sleeping (and dreaming) in the holy bed-chamber, his holy residence. He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone. After Sargon had received the regular deliveries for the palace, Ur-Zababa appointed him cupbearer, putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard. Holy Inana did not cease to stand by him.
Sargon and Ur-Zababa: c.2.1.4
So the two birds symbolize that the engendering as well as the inauguration of the seal owner as a cup-bearer. Both events happened when the sun went through the constellation Wings.



number 12
And on this imprint a goddess like Ishtar invited the seal owner to make love. The falcon in between them symbolized that this happened in the constellation Wings. So, this goddess became the spouse of the seal owner like Inanna was the spouse of Šulgi:
‘I drank beer in the palace founded by An with my brother and companion, the hero Utu. My singers praised me with songs accompanied by seven tigi drums. My spouse, the maiden Inanna, the lady, the joy of heaven and earth, sat with me at the banquet’.
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi A): c.2.4.2.01
All in all we see that the two birds on the previous imprint symbolized that a god engendered the seal owner in Wings and that years later the same god decreed a fate for him under the same constellation. And the falcon on the above imprint symbolized that the seal owner made love with a goddess like Ishtar in Wings again.
In Egypt Khepri was the creator god and when the sun passed Cancer this god started to create a New Year and the Egyptians wanted to adapt the creativity of the beetle and married.
In Mesopotamia gods like Tammuz married goddesses like Ishtar in June, again Mesopotamians married at the same time.
So, in these ancient cultures all important activities happened when the atmosphere was filled with divine creativity:
In the Indus Valley Civilization March was the most important month of the year. In that month the sun went through Rohini and the creator Prajapati was the deity of this nakshatra, so when the sun went through Rohini it started to create. Apparently, the Indus people wanted to adapt to this divine creativity, and they ploughed their fields and got married.



H-176 A
The sun killed in Taurus
This tablet found in Harappa shows that the sun depicted like a bull is killed in Rohini, which is symbolized by the temple in the middle. This killing scene depicts what is written in Rigveda hymn 5-40:
5 ‘O Surya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness,
All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. (-) 8 The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with praise and adoration, Established in the heaven the eye of Surya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic arts to vanish. 9 The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the brood Of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.’
When the sun was found again a new year may have began.
M-489B
In the middle of this Indus tablets Kartikeya made love with one of his three wives. This happened when the sun passed the same Rohini, here symbolized by a tree.
H-180 A
And on the left of this tablet Yama and Yami depicted like tigers celebrated a Sacred Marriage and engendered a child when the sun passed though the same Rohini. On the right the river goddess gave birth to this child, who was represented by a crocodile. This reptile symbolized that he was born when the sun passed through the constellation Makara (Capricorn).
So, in the Indus Valley Civilisation the killing of the sun and the engendering of new life happened in the same nakshatra, namely in Rohini, when a new year began.



About the Akitu festival
These days we get married whenever we want and we get a job anytime, anywhere without any relationship to any religious festivity. However, I think that this was not the case in ancient times, when religion was involved in all daily life practices. The gods caused the day and the night, the rise and the decline of the seasons, and I suppose that the people wanted to adapt to that. That is why I assume that the actions in the gospels also connect with the seasons and the festive activities that go with it. To demonstrate this, I want to compare some verses, mainly from the Gospel of John, with the creation myth Enuma Elis that is recited during the Akitu festival.
Number 13
Barley
In ancient Babylon Akitu (lit. ‘the barley-cutting’) was the highlight of the year:
‘Akitu or Akitum (Sumerian: ezen á.ki.tum, akiti-šekinku, á.ki.ti.še.gur10.ku5, lit. ‘the barley-cutting’, akiti-šununum, lit. ‘barley-sowing’; Akkadian: akitu or rêš-šattim, ‘head of the year’) was a spring festival in ancient Mesopotamia. The Babylonian Akitu festival has played a pivotal role in the development of theories of religion, myth and ritual, yet the purpose of the festival remains a point of contention among both historians of religion and Assyriologists. The name is from the Sumerian for ‘barley’, originally marking two festivals celebrating the beginning of each of the two half-years of the Sumerian calendar, marking the sowing of barley in autumn and the cutting of barley in spring. In Babylonian religion it came to be dedicated to Marduk's victory over Tiamat’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu
On the above imprint it was celebrated in the register below. It was indicated by the two barley signs.
’XE, The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed.' Published: http://www.sumerian.org/sumerlex.htm
In the upper register a wedding party may have been celebrated the moment the sun went through the constellation Crater.



Number 14
During this Akitu festival the myth Enuma Elis was recited and this imprint shows two scenes of it. The archer in the middle represents Marduk, because the inscription reads the name of the seal owner: ‘Marduk-zir-idin , son of...’ suggesting that the sun god is his divine father. The imprint depicts two scenes from the creation myth: first Tiamat opens her mouth and Marduk releases an arrow:
‘The Evil Wind, which followed behind, he let loose in her face. When Tiamat opened her mouth to consume him, He drove in the Evil Wind while as yet she had not shut her lips As the terrible winds filled her belly,
Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open. (100) He released the arrow, it tore her belly,

Then Marduk tramples Kingu underfoot:
‘For all their resistance, he trampled them underfoot. And Kingu, who had been made chief among them, He bound and accounted him to Uggae’. (120)
Enuma Elis: ‘When on High . . .’ The Mesopotamian/Babylonian Creation Myth by Dennis Bratcher
Once again, scarabs and seals demonstrated that important events happened in the same period. I think that this phenomenon can also be found in some chapters of the Gospel of John.



The Gospel of John begins with the following three sentences:
1:1 ‘The Word was in the beginning and the Word was with God and the Word was God. 1:2 This one was in the beginning with God. 1:3 All things became through him, and without him not even one thing became which has become into being’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
They describe the creation of the earth by the Word of God, which corresponds to the first verses of the Enuma Elis which describes the begetting and birth of all gods by Apsu and Tiamat:
‘When on high the heaven had not been named, Firm ground below had not been called by name, When primordial Apsu, their begetter, And Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all, Their waters mingled as a single body, No reed hut had sprung forth, no marshland had appeared, None of the gods had been brought into being, And none bore a name, and no destinies determined-Then it was that the gods were formed in the midst of heaven. Lahmu and Lahamu were brought forth, by name they were called’.

https://twitter.com/vaticannews/status/1077530681893371904
Then it is announced that the Word became flesh and resided among us:
1:9 ‘He was the true light coming into the world, the light which illuminates everyman. 1:10 He was in the world and the world became through him and the world did not know him. 1:11 He came to his own and his own did not receive him. 1:12 But as many as received him, he gave to them the authority to become children of God, to the ones who believe in his name, 1:13 who were born, not from bloods, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.
1:14 And the Word became flesh and resided among us (and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only begotten from the Father), full of favor and truth’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
And in the Enuma Elis Marduk was begotten by Ea and then Damkina bore him:
‘[The Birth of Marduk] In the chamber of fates, the abode of destinies, A god was engendered, most able and wisest of gods. (80) In the heart of Apsu was Marduk created, In the heart of holy Apsu was Marduk created. He who begot him was Ea, his father; She who bore him was Damkina, his mother’.
Enuma Elis: ‘When on High . . .’ The Mesopotamian/Babylonian Creation Myth by Dennis Bratcher



If Christ indeed ‘became flesh’ in Nisan then it is understandable that He is called ‘The Lamb of God’ and that he is also symbolized by a fish, because at that time in Nissan, the first month of the year, the spring equinox occurred between Aries and Pisces:
‘Mathematically a Zodiacal Age lasts 2.160 years (72 x 30 = 2160) The Zodiacal Ages rendered the Ages thus (all dates B.C.):
Lion (Leo) 10860 to 8640, Crab (Cancer), 8640 to 6480; Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0; then Fishes (Pisces), 0 to A.D. 2160’.

Medieval Agnus Dei with halo and cross; Euphrasian Basilica, Poreč, Croatia Lamb of God (Greek: Ἀμνὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ, romanized: Amnòs toû Theoû; Latin: Agnus Deī [ˈaɲus ˈde.i]) is a title for Jesus that appears in the Gospel of John. It appears at John 1:29, where John the Baptist sees Jesus and exclaims, ‘Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.’[1] It appears again in John 1:36.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God
Christ was symbolized by lamb as well as by a fish:
‘Ichthys as adopted as a Christian symbol. The ichthys or ichthus (/ˈɪkθəs/), from the Greek ikhthýs (ἰχθύς 1st cent. AD Koine Greek [ikhˈthys], ‘fish’) is a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble the profile of a fish. The symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol. It is now known colloquially as the ‘sign of the fish’ or the ‘Jesus fish’.

Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci. 1472 – 1475 the Gallery of the Uffizi, Florence, Italy. http://www.pravmir.com/lord-s-baptism-icons-frescoes-mosaics/
Then John baptized Jesus:
1:32 ‘And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him. 1:33 And I did not know him, but he who sent me to immerse in water, that one said to me, Upon whomever you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, this one is he who immerses in the Holy Spirit. 1:34 And I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
John saw that the Spirit remained upon him and he testified that this is the Son of God: ‘The baptism of Jesus is generally considered as the start of his ministry’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Jesus
In the Enuma Elis the gods decreed fates for Marduk and then he started his mission:
‘May thy fate, O lord, be supreme among the gods, Say but to wreck or create; it shall be. Open your mouth: the garment will vanish! Speak again, and the garment shall be whole!’ At the word of his mouth the garment vanished. He spoke again, and the garment was restored. When the gods, his fathers, saw the fruit of his word, Joyfully they did homage: ‘Marduk is king!’ They conferred on him sceptre, throne, and vestment; They gave him matchless weapons that ward off the foes: (30)

https://www.oramaworld.com/en/p/112067/The_Wedding_at_Cana_-_Hand-Painted_Icon
And then John described a marriage in Cana:
‘Joh 2:1-11 2:1 And there happened to be a marriage in Cana of Galilee in the third day, and the mother of Jesus was there; 2:2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage. 2:3 And having lacked enough wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine. 2:4 Jesus says to her, What is this thing with me and with you, woman? My hour is not coming yet. 2:5 His mother says to the servants, If he says anything to you, do it. 2:6 Now six stone water pots were placed there according to the Jews’ cleansing, making room for two or three nine-gallon measures apiece. {i.e. very large water pots} 2:7 Jesus says to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them to the top. 2:8 And he says to them, Dip-out some now and carry it to the chief waiter. And they carried it. 2:9 Now as the chief waiter tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it is from (but the servants knew, having dipped-out the water), the chief waiter summons the bridegroom, 2:10 and says to him, Every man first places the good wine on the table, and whenever they are drunken, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now. 2:11 This one was the beginning of the signs which Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
And on the Tenth Day of the Akitu festival Marduk marries Ishtar:
‘Tenth Day Arriving at ‘Bet Akitu’, god Marduk begins to celebrate with both the upper and nether world gods (the statues of gods were arranged around a huge table such as in a feast) then Marduk returns to the city at night celebrating his marriage to goddess ‘Ishtar’ where earth and heaven are united, and as the gods unite so is this union arranged on earth. Thus the king personifies this union by playing the role of marrying the highest priestess of the Esagila where they would both sit at the throne before the population and they recite special poems for the occasion. This love is going to bring forth life in spring’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu



Anonymous. Christ Drives the Merchants from the Temple. Duomo di Monreale. (Sicily)
In Passover (Eastern) Jesus cast all merchants forth out of the temple:
2:13 ‘And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. 2:14 And he found sitting in the temple, the ones who are selling bulls and sheep and doves, and the money-changers.
2:15 And he made a scourge out of ropes and cast all forth out of the temple, both the sheep and the bulls, and he poured out the coinage of the brokers and turned over their tables; 2:16 and to the ones who are selling the doves he said, Take° these things from here. Do not make my Father’s house a house of merchandise’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
And on the fifth day of the Akitu festival the priests slap the king because of his sins:
‘Fifth Day The submission of the king of Babylon before Marduk. The king would enter to the Easagila accompanied by the priests, they would approach all together the altar where the high priest of the Esagila impersonates Marduk then he approaches the king, begins to strip him of his jewelry, scepter and even his crown then he would slap him hard while the altar would kneel and begins to pray asking for Marduk's forgiveness and submitting to him saying: ‘I have not sinned O Lord of the universe, and I haven't neglected your heavenly might at all’... Then the priest in the role of
Marduk says: ‘Don't be afraid of what Marduk has to say, for he will hear your prayers, extends your power, and increases the greatness of your reign’. After this the king would stand up and the priest would give him back his jewelry, scepter and crown then slaps him hard again hoping for the king to shed tears, because that would express more the submission to Marduk and respect to his power. When the priest returns the crown to the king that means his power was renewed by Marduk, thus April would be considered not only the revival of nature and life but also to the State as well. Thus, these ceremonies would make the greatest and most feared personalities of that time submit to the greatest god, and live a humbling moment with all the population, sharing prayers to prove their faith before the might of God’.

But in Luke we read that after the baptism of Jesus Devil/Satan came to Him and tried to tempt him, but Jesus refused each temptation:
‘[Luke 4] 4:1 Now full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was being led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 4:2 being tempted by the devil for forty days. And he ate nothing in those days, and later, after they were completed, he hungered. 4:3 And the devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone in order that it may become bread. 4:4 And Jesus answered to him, saying, It has been written, ‘Man will not live upon bread only, but upon every declaration from God.’ 4:5 And the devil, having led him up into a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited-earth in an instant of time. 4:6 And the devil said to him, I will be giving all this authority, and the glory of them, to you, because it has been given to me, and I am giving it to whomever I wish. 4:7 Therefore, if you worship only in my sight, all this will be yours. 4:8 And Jesus answered and said to him, Proceed behind me, adversary! It has been written, ‘You will be worshiping the Lord your God and you will be giving-divine service to him only.’ 4:9 And he led him to Jerusalem, and stood him upon the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself downward from here. 4:10 For it has been written, ‘He will be commanding his messengers concerning you, to guard you,’ 4:11 and, ‘They will lift you up upon their hands, lest you might hit your foot with a stone.’ 4:12 And Jesus answered and said to him, It has been spoken, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’ 4:13 And after the devil had completed every temptation, he withdrew from him till another time’.

But in the Enuma Elis Marduk defeats Tiamat and Kingu:
‘The Evil Wind, which followed behind, he let loose in her face. When Tiamat opened her mouth to consume him, He drove in the Evil Wind while as yet she had not shut her lips As the terrible winds filled her belly,
Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open. (100) He released the arrow, it tore her belly,
‘For all their resistance, he trampled them underfoot. And Kingu, who had been made chief among them, He bound and accounted him to Uggae’. (120)

Then Jesus answered and said to them, Tear-down this temple and I will be lifting it up in three days:
2:18 ‘Therefore, the Jews answered and said to him, What sign are you showing to us? Why is it that you are doing these things?
2:19 Jesus answered and said to them, Tear-down this temple and I will be lifting it up in three days.
2:20 Therefore the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years and you will be lifting it up in three days? 2:21 But that he spoke concerning the temple of his body. 2:22 Therefore, when he was raised up from the dead, his disciples were reminded that he spoke this, and they believed in the Scripture and the word in which Jesus had said. 2:23 Now as he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many believed in his name at the feast, viewing his signs which he was doing.. 2:24 But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them, because he knows all people, 2:25 and because he had no need that anyone should testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man’.
In the Enuma Elis Marduk formed Heaven and Earth from the body of Tiamat:
‘With his unsparing mace he crushed her skull. (130) When the arteries of her blood he had severed, The North Wind bore it to places undisclosed. On seeing this, his fathers were joyful and jubilant, They brought gifts of homage to him. Then the lord paused to view her dead body, That he might divide the form and do artful works. He split her like a shellfish into two parts: Half of her he set up as a covering for heaven, Pulled down the bar and posted guards. He bade them to allow not her waters to escape. (140) He crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions. He squared Apsu's quarter, the abode of Nudimmud, As the lord measured the dimensions of Apsu. The Great Abode, its likeness, he fixed as Esharra, The Great Abode, Esharra, which he made as the firmament’.

During the last supper Jesus says to his disciples that they will be bring forth much fruit and will become his disciples:
15:1 ‘I am the true vine and my Father is the farmer. 15:2 Every branch which is not bringing forth fruit in me, he takes it away and every branch which is bringing forth fruit, he prunes it, in order that it may bring forth more fruit. 15:3 Already you are clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 15:4 Abide in me and I in you. Just-as the branch is not able to bring forth fruit from itself, if it does not abide in the vine; so neither can you if you do not abide in me. 15:5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him, this one is bringing forth much fruit, because you are not able to do anything separate from me. 15:6 If anyone does not abide in me, he was cast outside like a branch and was dried up, and they gather them and cast them into the fire and it is burned. 15:7 If you abide in me, and then my words should abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will happen for you.
15:8 My Father is glorified in this, in order that you may bring forth much fruit and will become my disciples.
15:9 Just-as the Father loved me’.

And during the Atiku festival Marduk renewed the power of the king:
‘Fifth day
When the priest returns the crown to the king that means his power was renewed by Marduk, thus April would be considered not only the revival of nature and life but also to the State as well. Thus, these ceremonies would make the greatest and most feared personalities of that time submit to the greatest god, and live a humbling moment with all the population, sharing prayers to prove their faith before the might of God. Following his presence in his earthly home Babylon and renewing its king's power, god Marduk stays in the Etemenanki (a ziggurat or tower composed of seven floors, known in the Torah as the Tower of Babylon) where was Marduk's dwelling or in the temple Esagila‘.

19:28 ‘After this Jesus, having seen that all things have already been completed, in order that the Scripture might be completed, which says, ‘I am thirsty.’ 19:29 Therefore, a vessel was laying full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge from the vinegar and having placed it around a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth. 19:30 Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, ‘It has been completed’.

There is also a correspond to another death and resurrection myth, because Jesus calls himself: ‘the bright morning star’:
Revelation 22:16 Jesus says: ‘I, Jesus, sent my messenger to testify to you these things in the congregations ‘I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star’.

And in Sumer the goddess of the morning star was Inanna. In the myth ‘Descent into the Underworld’ she was killed, but later she revises. This happened in Pleiades, so in March:
‘They looked at her – it was the look of death. They spoke to her – it was the speech of anger. They shouted at her – it was the shout of heavy guilt. The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse. And the corpse was hung on a hook’.
‘The gala-tura and the kur-jara sprinkle Inanna's corpse with the food and water of life and revive her’.

M1918a
And in the Indus Valley civilization Shiva kills the sun god Yama in Rohini and then he revived him, as shown on this tablet. Yama has the shape of a bull, because he is killed when he passes through Taurus. At that time this happened in March, which means that this killing indicated the Spring Equinox. The mythical reason for this killing is given in the next story:
‘Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result, he was given the choice of either a righteous son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life. Mrikandu rishi chose the former, and was blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of 16. Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva. Yama then came in person to take away Markandeya's life, and sprung his noose around the young sage's neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, and out of it, Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression. After defeating Yama in battle to the point of death, Shiva then revived him, under the condition that the devout youth would live forever. For this act, Shiva was thereafter also known as Kalantaka (‘Ender of Death’).’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markandeya
This sign below symbolizes a temple, which is a symbol of Rohini. And thus the killing and resurrection of Yama happens in this nakshatra.



The fresco of scene ‘Feed my sheep’ - Jesus give the power to St. Peter in church St. Mary Abbots by John Clayton jnr.
Then Jesus says to Peter: ‘Feed my lambs’, ‘Shepherd my sheep’, ’Feed my sheep’:
21:15 ‘Therefore when they had a meal, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more-than these? He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He says to him, Feed my lambs. 21:16 He says to him again a second-time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep. 21:17 He says to him the third-time, Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me? Peter was sorrowful because he said to him the third-time, Do you love me like a friend? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you like a friend. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep’.
Holy Bible Modern Literal Version New Testament 2020 Beta Update (July 17, 2019)
In fact Jesus decide a fate for Peter and in the Enuma Elis the gods and Lord Marduk decide the fate of the people of Marduk (Ashur):
‘Eleventh Day
The gods return accompanied by their Lord Marduk (Ashur) to meet again in the Destinies Hall ‘Upshu Ukkina’, where they met for the first time on the eight day, this time they will decide the fate of the people of Marduk (Ashur). In ancient Assyrian philosophy Creation in general was considered as a covenant between heaven and earth as long as a human serves the gods till his death, therefore, gods' happiness isn't complete except if humans are happy as well, thus a human's destiny will be to be given happiness on the condition that he serves the gods’.

Then Jesus and John leave the other disciples:
21:18 ‘Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, when you were younger, you were girding yourself and were walking where you were wishing. But whenever you are elderly, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and will be carrying you where you do not wish. 21:19 Now he spoke this signifying by what sort of death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me. 21:20 But Peter, having turned again, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned-back upon his chest at the supper and who had said, Lord, who is he who is giving you up? 21:21 Peter having seen this one says to Jesus, Lord and what about this one? 21:22 Jesus says to him, If I will for him to abide until I come, what is that to you? You, follow me! 21:23 Therefore this speech went forth to the brethren, that, that disciple does not die. And yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I will that he remains until I come, what is that to you?’

Number 15
Many Christians observe the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March,
‘According to Luke 1:26, the Annunciation occurred "in the sixth month" of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist. Many Christians observe this event with the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March, an approximation of the northern vernal equinox nine full months before Christmas, the ceremonial birthday of Jesus. The Annunciation is a key topic in Christian art in general, as well as in Marian art in the Catholic Church, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A work of art depicting the Annunciation is sometimes itself called an Annunciation’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation
If we assume that the Jewish culture was embedded in the surrounding cultures, then it could indeed be correct that Jesus was conceived in March, because in that month he was baptized thirty years later and again three years later he was crucified in March and then he resurrected on Easter. This is in line with my findings that indicate that it was common that many personal events, although there could have been many years between two consecutive events, happened under the same constellation.

Number 8 Egyptian Scarab: Amenhotep III An ancient Egyptian inscribed steatite scarab bearing the cartouche of New Kingdom Pharaoh Amenhotep III, reading, ‘Nub-Maat-Re.’ New Kingdom, 18th - 19th Dynasty, ca. 1550-1190 BC. Height: 15 mm. The ancient Egyptians believed the Scarabeus Beetle was able to spontaneously regenerate itself from cow dung, which these beetles can be observed rolling into small balls and burying. Consequently the scarab came to symbolize a spontaneous continuation of the life cycle. These finely carved amulets were worn in life and in necklaces around the mummy. Often the bases were inscribed with symbols or ‘words of power,’ intended to magically invigorate the wearer. Formerly in the Ernest C. Freemark collection, (1882-1966), Elmore, Ohio, examined by J. H. Breasted in 1916.

Number 9 Amenhotep III fathered two sons with his Great Royal Wife Tiye: the Crown Prince Tuthmose who predeceased his father and his second son Akhenaten who ultimately succeeded him to the throne. Amenhotep may also be the father of a third sonùcalled Smenkhkare who would later succeed Akhenaten and briefly rule Egypt as king. Amenhotep III and Tiye also had four known daughters: Sitamun, Henuttaneb, Isis or Iset and Nebetah. They appear frequently on statues and reliefs during their father's reign and are also represented by smaller objects with the exception of Nebetah. Nebetah is attested only once in the historical records on a colossal limestone group of statues from Medinet Habu. This huge seven metre high sculpture shows Amenhotep III and Tiye seated side by side, ‘with three of their daughters standing in front of the throne--Henuttaneb, the largest and best preserved, in the centre; Nebetah on the right; and another, whose name is destroyed, on the left.’

Number 10 British Museum number: 89769 Description: Pale green grossular garnet cylinder seal in the modelled style; a beardless male worshipper stands facing right, points with his right hand and extends the other towards the warriorgoddess Ishtar who stands on the back of a couchant lion, raises her right hand and holds a bow and two arrows in her left. Behind the two figures are a date-palm and two rearing crossed ibexes or mountain goats. In the upper field, behind the worshipper's head is an earring. The worshipper has shoulder-length hair and wears a short-sleeved, hexagaon-patterned, fringed robe with a webbing belt, and sandals. A row of dots above his forehead may indicate the hairline but could be a jewelled circlet; he has a necklace of square plaques, in which dots probably indicate jewels, with a tasselled necklace counterweight hanging behind, and bracelets on each wrist (that on the right wrist has a star pattern); at his waist is a sword with a lion's head decorating the hilt. Ishtar wears a tall, cylindrical, feathered and horned head-dress decorated with dots. Her hair is slightly longer than the worshipper's. She wears a short-sleeved, hexagon-patterned, fringed robe with a webbing belt, which hangs open to reveal a hexagon-patterned, fringed kilt; she also wears sandals. She may have a plain band around her neck but this could be the edge of her robe; a tasselled band hanging behind may be attached to her head-dress or it may be a necklace counterweight; she has triple



bracelets on each wrist, single armbands above the elbow and a triplet anklet is visible on her right ankle (the left ankle is hidden by her robe). She has crossed quivers on her back which are tipped by stars and decorated with dots, she also has a dot-decorated bow-case and sickle-sword on her back. A sword at her waist has hilt made up of three drill-holes; small lines near the end of the star-tipped scabbard probably stand for the pair of lion or volutes with which the scabbards were often decorated. She holds her arrows close to the feathers, point upwards and her bow is decorated with ducks' heads. Her lion turns its head back towards her; its jaws are closed and its body is decorated with minute drill-holes to indicate fur on the mane and belly. The palm-tree has eleven branches and triple bunches of dates hang down on each side. The crossed male ibexes or mountain goats twist their heads backwards over their shoulders. Both ears are shown and the tips of both notched horns. The animals are bearded and three rows of chevrons mark the hair along the underside of their necks and across their flanks; their tufted tails curl upwards. The musculature is carefully indicated. The earring is crescent-shaped with three bell-like arms. Minute details such as the patterning of the robes, the crossed quivers on Ishtar's back and her sickle, sword, bow and two arrows are beautifully cut. Line borders at top and bottom. Slight chipping at the ends. A very narrow, straight perforation.
