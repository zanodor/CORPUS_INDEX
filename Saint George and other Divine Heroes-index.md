Saint George and other Divine Heroes.
THE DIVINE HERO
The myth of Saint George is very well-rooted in the mythical and
religious western medieval culture. In my opinion, this myth is rooted
much deeper, and I think the myth origins back to archetypical times
to the mythical symbols of heavenly Gods and Goddess in star myths
and even to the myth of Creation.

Swedish rock carving.



A Star Atlas with the contours of the Northern and Southern Milky
Way.
In my opinion, one can easily accept the idea that the contours of the
Milky Way can symbolise a male figure on the northern Sky and that
the southern Milky Way contours can symbolise a female figure.
These to symbols from the northern and southern hemisphere are
divided by the pole positions of the Earth rotation and are therefore
mythological and religious said to be "in opposition to each other".
The male contours of the Milky Way and the female figure of the
southern Milky Way is mythological sometime mentioned to be
humans and sometime to be animals and sometimes as a human and
an animal. For instant many cultures have a Heavenly Cow as a
symbol for the southern Milky Way contours, and it is in this concept
the myth of St. George shall be interpretated.

from a Braktheatre.
Mythological the story telling about the northern and southern Milky
Way contour figures are build up by a story of the meeting of 2 great
mythological forces of powerful beasts or the meeting of the male
and female force of creation.
The story telling also can symbolise the meeting and melting
together of the 2 psychological and physiological qualities in a male
and female in an ritual transition in order to gain spiritual
cosmological knowledge to the benefit of personal and social



growth.
If such an meeting an melting together of forces is succeeded, the
Hero first of all wins his spiritual Princess, namely his alter ego, and
the society in which the Hero lives, benefits of the gained
cosmological knowledge which is for the Hero to arrange the
seasonal rituals for agriculture as well of the ritual transition periods
of every individual in the village.
Descent to the underworld
The theme of mythical deities and Heroes "descending to The
Underworld is of course very global since it deals with the the
Southern Earth Hemisphere and especially with the southern
Milky Way contours and the Great Mother Goddess and the
archetype of the Milky Way center.

Harrowing of Hell, an icon by Dionisius, from the Ferapontov
Monastery.
The descent to the underworld is a mytheme of comparative
mythology found in the religions of the Ancient Near East up to and
including Christianity. The myth involves the death of a youthful god
(or goddess: Persephone, Inanna, for instance) who is a life-death
rebirth deity, mourned and then recovered from the underworld by
his or her consort, lover or mother.

1 Katabasis 2 Mythological characters



Katabasis
Main article: katabasis
One meaning of katabasis is the epic convention of the hero's trip
into the underworld.[1] In Greek mythology, for example, Orpheus
enters the underworld in order to bring Eurydice back to the world of
the living.
Most katabases take place in a supernatural underworld, such as
Hades or Hell — as in Nekyia, the 11th book of the Odyssey, which
describes the descent of Odysseus to the underworld. However,
katabasis can also refer to a journey through other dystopic areas,
like those Odysseus encounters on his 20-year journey back from
Troy to Ithaca. Pilar Serrano[1] allows the term katabasis to
encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those
of Lazarus and Castor and Pollux.
