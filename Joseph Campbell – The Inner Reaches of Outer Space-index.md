riginally published in 1986, The Inner Reaches ofOuter Space was rhe lasr book Joseph Campbell completed before his dearh. Now ew World Library is rereleasing Campbell's classic in rhis beautiful edition as parr of rhe Collected Works of Joseph Campbell. Campbell developed rhe book from a series of lecrures he delivered in San Francisco, which included a legendary symposium ar the Palace of Fine Arrs with asrronaur Rusty Schweickarr. Here Campbell explores rhe Space Age, and posits rhat the newly discovered laws of ourer space are actually within us as well, and that a new mythology is implicit in that realization. Bur what is this new mythology? How can we recognize ir? Campbell explores rhese questions in the concluding essay, "The Way of An," where he demonstrates that metaphor is the language of arr and argues that within rhe psyches of roday's arrisrs are the seeds of tomorrow's mythologies. Also included in this wide-ranging collection are Campbell's rhoughrs on mythology as a function of biology in "Myth and rhe Body" and his series of essays, " Metaphor as Myth and as Religion, " where he presented for rhe first rime a fundamental summary of his pioneering work in mythology and comparative religion. As Campbell writes in his introduction: "My desire and grear pleasure in rhe preparation of this little volume has been as rendering a rerurn gifr ro rhe Graces for the transforming insights of rhese recent years, which ... we have been resting our in a broadly shared spiritual advenrure."

ABOUT THE CoLLECTED WoRKS OF JosEPH CAMPBELL
At his death in 1987, Joseph Campbell left a significant body of pub lished work that explored his lifelong passion, the complex of universal myths and symbols that he called "Mankind's one great story." He also left, however, a large volume of unreleased work: uncollected anicles, notes, letters, and diaries, as well as audio- and videotape recorded lectures. The Joseph Campbell Foundation was founded in 1991 to pre serve, protect, and perpetuate Campbell's work. The Foundation has undertaken to archive his papers and recordings in digital format, and to publish previously unavailable material and out-of-print works as The Collected WOrks ofjoseph Campbell.

FoREWORD
The chapters of this volume have been developed from lectures delivered in San Francisco, 1981-1984, to themes proposed by Barbara McClintock, Director of Public Programs at the C. G. Jung Institute in that city, and by Lynne Kaufman, Program Director, International Studies, at the University of California, Berkeley. The Inner Reaches of Outer Space was the tide and topic of a symposium organized by Barbara McClintock in 1983, where, be fore an immense audience brought together in the great hall of The Palace of Fine Arts, I shared the platform with the astronaut Rusty Schweickart. Metaphor As Myth and As Religion was the tide of my address delivered in 1984, also in that great hall, at the festival instituted by Lynne Kaufman in celebration of my eightieth birthday. The poet Robert Bly, archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, tai chi master Al Chungliang Huang, philosopher Sam Keen, psychologist Stanley Keleman, and anthropologist Barbara Meyerhoff shared the platform on that spectacular occasion, which terminated with a descent from the high ceiling of a galaxy of balloons. To my wife, Jean Erdman, dancer and choreographer, I owe the whole theme and argument of my lecture "The Way ofArt," composed in 1981 for Barbara McClintock's symposium, A Call to Beauty, conducted by James Hillman; while my talk

INTRODUCTION
MYTH AND THE BoDY
Reviewing with unprej udiced eye the religious traditions of mankind, one becomes very soon aware of certain mythic motifs that are common to all, though differently understood and developed in the differing traditions: ideas, for example, of a life beyond death, or of malevolent and protective spirits. Adolf Bastian (1826-1905) , a medical man, world traveler, and lead ing ethnologist of the nineteenth century, for whom the chair in anthro pology at the University of Berlin was established, termed these recurrent themes and features "elementary ideas," Elementargedanken, designating as "ethnic" or "folk ideas," Volkergedanken, the differing manners of their rep resentation, interpretation, and application in the arts and customs, mythologies and theologies, of the peoples of this single planet. Such a recognition of two aspects, a universal and a local, in the con stitution of religions everywhere clarifies at one stroke those controversies touching eternal and temporal values, truth and falsehood, which forever engage theologians; besides setting apart, as of two distinct yet related sci ences, studies on the one hand of the differing "ethnic" or "folk ideas," which are the concern properly of historians and ethnologists, and on the other hand, of the Elementargedanken, which pertain to psychology. A number of leading psychologists of the past century addressed themselves

x1v Th e In n e r Rea c h es of O u te r Sp a c e
t o the analysis o f these universals, o f whom Carl G . Jung (1875-I961) , it seems to me, was the most insightful and illuminating. The same mythic motifs that Bastian had termed "elementary ideas," Jung called "archetypes of the collective unconscious," transferring emphasis, thereby, from the mental sphere of rational ideation to the obscure subliminal abysm out of which dreams arise. For myths and dreams, in this view, are motivated from a single psy chophysiological source-namely, the human imagination moved by the conflicting urgencies of the organs (including the brain) of the human body, of which the anatomy has remained pretty much the same since c. 40,000 B.C. Accordingly, as the imagery of a dream is metaphorical of the psychology of its dreamer, that of a mythology is metaphorical of the psy chological posture of the people to whom it pertains. The sociological structure coordinate to such a posture was termed by the Africanist Leo Frobenius (1873-1938) a cultural "monad. " Every feature ofsuch a social or ganism is, in his sense, expressive and therefore symbolic of the informing psychological posture. In The Decline of the West, Oswald Spengler (188o-1936) identified eight colossal monads of great majesty, with a ninth now in formation, as having shaped and dominated world history since the rise, in the fourth millennium B.c., of the first literate high cultures-(!) the Sumero-Babylonian, (2) the Egyptian, (3) the G reco-Roman (Apollonian) , (4) the Vedic-Aryan, of lndia, (5) the Chinese, (6) the Maya Aztec-Incan, (7) the Magian (Persian-Arabian, Judeo-Christian-Islamic) , (8) the Faustian (Gothic-Christian to modern European-American) , and now, beneath the imposed alien crust of a Marxian cultural pseudomor phosis, (9) the germinating Russian-Christian. 1 Long antecedent, however, to the world-historical appearances, flow erings, and inevitable declines of these monumental monads, an all but timeless period is recognized of nonliterate, aboriginal societies-some no madic hunters, others settled horticulturalists; some of no more than a half dozen related families, others of tens of thousands. And each had its mythology-some, pitifully fragmentary, but others, marvelously rich and magnificently composed. These mythologies were all conditioned, of course, by local geography and social necessities. Their images were derived from the local landscapes, flora and fauna, from recollections of personages



In trodu ctio n xv
and events, shared visionary experiences, and so forth. Narrative themes and other mythic features, furthermore, have passed from one domain to another. However, the definition of the "monad" is not a function of the number and character of such influences and details, but of the psychologi cal stance in relation to their universe of the people, whether great or small, ofwhom the monad is the cohering life. The study of any mythology from the point of view of an ethnologist or historian, therefore, is of the rele vance of its metaphors to a disclosure of the structure and force of the nu cleating monad by which every feature of the culture is invested with its spiritual sense. Out of this emerge the forms of its art, its tools, and its weapons, ritual forms, musical instruments, social regulations, and ways of relating in war and in peace to its neighbors. In terms of Bastian's vocabulary, these monads are local organizations of the number of "ethnic" or "folk ideas" of the represented cultures, con stellating variously in relation to current needs and interests the primal en ergies and urges of the common human species: bioenergies that are of the essence of life itself, and which, when unbridled, become terrific, horrify ing, and destructive. The first, most elementary and horrifying of all, is the innocent vora ciousness of life, which feeds on lives and provides the first interest of the infant feeding on its mother. The peace of sleep shatters in nightmare into apparitions of the cannibal ogress, cannibal giant, or approaching croco dile, which are features, also, of the fairy tale. In Dionysiac orgies the cul minating frenzies issue still, in some parts of the world, in the merciless group-cannibalizing of living bulls. The most telling mythological image of this grim first premise of life is to be seen in the Hindu figure of the world mother herself as Kali, "Black Time," licking up with her extended, long, red tongue the lives of all the living of this world of her creation. For, as noticed in a paper on ritual killing by Adolf E. Jensen, the late director of the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt-am-Main, "It is the common mark of all animal life that it can maintain itself only by destroying life;" citing to this point an Abyssinian song in celebration of the joys of life: "He who has not yet killed, shall kill. She who has not yet given birth shall bear." 2 The second primal compulsion, linked almost in identity with the first (as recognized in this Abyssinian paean) , is the sexual, generative urge,



XVI The Inner Reaches of Outer Space
which during the years of passage out of infancy comes to knowledge with such urgency that in its seasons it overleaps the claims even of the first. For here the species talks. The individual is surpassed. In the quiver of the
Hindu god Kama, whose name means "desire" and "longing," and who is
a counterpart of Cupid-no child, however, but a splendid youth, emitting
a fragrance of blossoms, dark and magnificent as an elephant stung with ve
hement desire-there are five flowered arrows to be sent flying from his
flowery bow, and their names are "Open Up!" "Exciter of the Paroxysm of Desire, " "The Inflamer," "The Parcher," and "The Carrier of Death." Orgies of whole companies overtaken by the released zeal of the arrows of this god are reported from every quarter of the globe. A third motivation, which has been the unique generator of the action on the stage of world history-since the period, at least, of Sargon I of Akkad, in southern Mesopotamia, c. 2300 B.c.-is the apparently irre sistible impulse to plunder. Psychologically, this might perhaps be read as an extension of the bioenergetic command to feed upon and consume; however, the motivation here is not of any such primal biological urgency, but of an impulse launched from the eyes, not to consume, but to possess. An ample anthology of exemplary texts to this purpose, readily at hand, will be found in the Bible; for example:
When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you are en tering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than yourselves, and when the Lord your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them; then you must utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them and show them no mercy. You shall not make marriages with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons. For they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods; then the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you utterly. But thus shall you deal with them; you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his



In troductio n xvu
own possession, out of all the peoples that are on the face of the earth. (Deuteronomy 7:1-6) When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it. And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you. But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it; and when the Lord your God gives it into your hand you shall put all its males to the sword, but the women and the little ones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty for yourselves; and you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given you. Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here. But in the cities of these people that the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord your God has commanded. (Deuteronomy 20:10-18) And when the Lord your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, with great and goodly cities, which you did not build, and houses full of all good things, which you did not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive trees, which you did not plant, and when you eat and are full, then take heed lest you for get the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. (Deuteronomy 6:10-12)
War gods of this kind, always tribal in their ranges both of mercy and of power, have abounded over the earth as the fomenting agents of world history. Indra of the Vedic Aryans, Zeus and Ares of the Homeric Greeks, were deities of this class, contemporary with Yahweh; and in the period (sixteenth to twentieth centuries A.D.) of the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Anglo-Saxon struggles for hegemony over the peoples of the planet, even Christ, his saints, and the Virgin Mary were converted into the tute laries of pillaging armies. In the Artha Siistra, "Textbook on the Art of Winning," which is a clas sic Indian treatise on polity believed to have been compiled by Kau!ilya,

the counselor to the founder of the Maurya dynasty, King Chandragupta I (reigned c. 321-297 B . c.) , the moral order by which all life is governed, and according to which kings and princes are therefore to be advised, is recog nized and expounded as the "Law of the Fish" (matsya-nyiiya), which is, simply: "The big ones eat the little ones and the little ones have to be nu merous and fast." For, whether in the depths of the forgotten sea out of which life origi nated, or in the jungle of its evolution on land, or now in these great cities that are being built to be demolished in our recurrent wars, the same dread triad of god-given urgencies, of feeding, procreating, and overcoming, are the motivating powers. And for the proper functioning of at least the first and third of these motivations in the fish pond of world history, the first requirement in the order of nature-as already recognized in the passage just quoted from Deuteronomy 7:1-6 (seventh century B . c.)-is suppres sion of the natural impulse to mercy. For the quality of mercy, empathy, or compassion is also a gift of na ture, late to appear in the evolution of species, yet evident already in the play and care of their young of the higher mammals. In contrast to the bioenergetic urge to procreate, however, which is an immediate urgency of the organs, compassion, like the will to plunder, is an impulse launched from the eyes. Moreover, it is not tribal- or species-oriented, but open to the appeal of the whole range of living beings. So that one of the first concerns of the elders, prophets, and established priesthoods of tribal or institutionally oriented mythological systems has always been to limit and define the permitted field of expression of this expansive fac ulty of the heart, holding it to a fixed focus within the field exclusively of the ethnic monad, while deliberately directing outward every impulse to violence. Within the monadic horizon deeds of violence are forbidden: "Thou shalt not kill . . . Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife" (Exodus 20: 13, q; also, Deuteronomy 5=17, 21) , whereas abroad, such acts are required: "You shall put all its males to the sword, but the wo men . . . you shall take as booty to yourselves" (Deuteronomy 20 :13-14) . In Islamic thought the nations of the earth are distinguished as of two realms: dar al'isliim, "the realm of submission [to Allah] , " and dar al'harb, "the realm of war," which is to say, the rest of the world. And in



In trodu ctio n XlX
Christian thought, the words reported of the resurrected Christ to his eleven remaining apostles-"Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations" (Matthew 28 :19)-have been interpreted as a divine man date for a conquest of the planet. In our present day, when this same planet, Earth, rocking slowly on its axis in its course around the sun, is about to pass out of astrological range of the zodiacal sign of the Fish (Pisces) into that of the Water Bearer (Aquarius) , it does indeed seem that a fundamental transformation of the historical conditions of its inhabiting humanity is in prospect, and that the age of the conquering armies of the contending monster monads which was inaugurated in the time of Sargon I of Akkad, some 4,320 years ago, in southern Iraq-may be about to close. For there are no more intact monadic horizons: all are dissolving. And along with them, the psychological hold is weakening of the mythological images and related social rituals by which they were supported. As already recognized half a century ago by the Irish poet Yeats in his foreboding vi sion "The Second Coming" :
Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity,
Surely some revelation is at hand . . . 3
The old gods are dead or dying and people everywhere are searching, asking: What is the new mythology to be, the mythology of this unified earth as of one harmonious being? One cannot predict the next mythology any more than one can predict tonight's dream; for a mythology is not an ideology. It is not something projected from the brain, but something experienced from the heart, from recognitions of identities behind or within the appearances of nature, per ceiving with love a "thou" where there would have been otherwise only an

"it." As stated already centuries ago in the Indian Kena Upani�ad (Upanishad): "That which in the lightning flashes forth, makes one blink, and say 'Ah!'-that 'Ah!' refers to divinity."4 And centuries before that, in the Chhandogya Upani�ad (c. ninth century B.c.) :
When [in the world] one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, recog nizes nothing else: that is [participation in] the Infinite. But when one sees, hears, and recognizes only otherness: that is smallness. The Infinite is the immortal. That which is small is mortal. But sir, that Infinite: upon what is it established? Upon its own greatness--or rather, not upon greatness. For by greatness people here understand cows and horses, elephants and gold, slaves, wives, mansions and estates. That is not what I mean; not that! For in that context everything is established on something else. This Infinite of which I speak is below. It is above. It is to the west, to the east, to the south, to the north. It is, in fact, this whole world. And accordingly, with respect to the notion of ego (aharrzktirtideia): I also am below, above, to the east, to the south, and to the north. I, also, am this whole world. Or again, with respect to the Self {Iitman).· The Self (the Spirit) is below, above, to the west, to the east, to the south, and to the north. The Self (the Spirit), indeed, is the whole world. Verily, the one who sees this way, thinks and understands this way, takes pleasure in the Self, delights in the Self, dwells with the Self and knows bliss in the Self; such a one is autonomous (svartij), mov ing through all the world at pleasure (ktimactira). Whereas those who think otherwise are ruled by others (anya-rtijan), know but perishable pleasures, and are moved about the world against their will (akti mactira). 5
The life of a mythology derives from the vitality of its symbols as metaphors delivering, not simply the idea, but a sense of actual participa tion in such a realization of transcendence, infinity, and abundance, as this of which the upanishadic authors tell. Indeed, the first and most essential service of a mythology is this one, of opening the mind and heart to the utter wonder of all being. And the second service, then, is cosmological: of representing the universe and whole spectacle of nature, both as known to



In trodu ctio n XXI
the mind and as beheld by the eye, as an epiphany of such kind that when lightning flashes, or a setting sun ignites the sky, or a deer is seen standing alerted, the exclamation "Ah!" may be uttered as a recognition of divinity. This suggests that in the new mythology, which is to be of the whole human race, the old Near Eastern desacralization of nature by way of a doctrine of the Fall will have been rejected; so that any such limiting sen timent as that expressed in 2 Kings 5:15, "there is no God in all the earth but in Israel," will be (to use a biblical term) an abomination. The image of the universe will no longer be the old Sumero-Babylonian, locally cen tered, three-layered affair, of a heaven above and abyss below, with an ocean-encircled bit of earth between; nor the later, Ptolemaic one, of a mysteriously suspended globe enclosed in an orderly complex of revolving crystalline spheres; nor even the recent heliocentric image of a single plane tary system at large within a galaxy of exploding stars; but (as of today, at least) an inconceivable immensity of galaxies, dusters of galaxies, and clus ters of dusters (superclusters) of galaxies, speeding apart into expanding distance, with humanity as a kind of recently developed scurf on the epi dermis of one of the lesser satellites of a minor star in the outer arm of an average galaxy, amidst one of the lesser clusters among the thousands, cata pulting apart, which took form some fifteen billion years ago as a conse quence of an inconceivable preternatural event. In chapter 1, the relevance to mythology of our present knowledge of this still-unfolding wonder is ventilated. Chapter 2, which treats of the art of reading the pictorial script and in terpreting the metaphorical vocabularies of mythology, is intended simply as a reminder of what we already know but tend to forget, which is that the his torically conditioned forms of thought and language by which our lives are shaped are indeed historically conditioned, whereas the psychosomatic entity that is everywhere being shaped-namely, the bioenergetic system of the one species, Homo sapiens sapienr-is and has been for some forty millennia a constant. Hence, the "elementary ideas" (Bastian), or "archetypes of the col lective unconscious" Oung), of this single species-which are biologically grounded and at once the motivating powers and connoted references of the historically conditioned metaphorical figures of mythologies throughout the world-are, like the laws of space, unchanged by changes of location.



xxii Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Sp a c e
The new mythology, therefore, which i s rapidly becoming a social as well as spiritual necessity as the monadic structures of the past dissolve, is already implicit among us as knowledge a priori, native to the mind. Its im ages, recognized with rapture as radiant of that greatness which is below, above, to the west, to the east, to the south, and to the north of this whole new universe and of all things, will be derived from contemporary life, thought, and experience, anywhere and everywhere, and the moral order to the support of which they are to be brought shall be of the monad of mankind. In chapter 3, "The Way of Art," the radical transformation of mind and therewith of vision that is required for the recognition of all things in this way, as epiphanies of the rapture of being, is defined and discussed in terms of the principles of esthetics. For it is the artist who brings the im ages of a mythology to manifestation, and without images (whether men tal or visual) there is no mythology. Moreover, it is the nonjudgmental way of seeing that is proper to the arts which allows things to stand forth and be seen simply as they are, as neither desirable nor to be feared, but as state ments, each in its own mode, of the nature of being. In the words of William Blake: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite."6 Thus viewed, in the way of the method of art, the features of an envi ronment become transparent to transcendence, which is the way of vision of myth. Features of especial moment and objects of essential use acquire in this way symbolic significance, as do likewise personages in social roles of importance. The whole known world is thus experienced as an esthetic wonder. Its animals, rocks, and trees are the features of a Holy Land, radi ant of eternity. Shrines are established, here and there, as sites of especial force or history. Certain birds and beasts are recognized as symbolically outstanding. And the social order is brought, as far as possible, to accord with an intuited order of nature, the whole sense of which is harmony and well-being. Every functioning mythology is an organization of insights of this order, made known by way of works of visual art and verbal narrative (whether scriptural or oral) and applied to communal life by way of a calendar of symbolic rites, festivals, and manners, social classifications,



In trodu ctio n xxm
pedagogic initiations, and ceremonies of investiture, by virtue of which the community is itself mythologized, to become metaphorical of transcen dence, participating with its universe in eternity. Thus a mythology is a control system, on the one hand framing its community to accord with an intuited order of nature and, on the other hand, by means of its symbolic pedagogic rites, conducting individuals through the ineluctable psychophysiological stages of transformation of a human lifetime-birth, childhood and adolescence, age, old age, and the release of death-in unbroken accord simultaneously with the require ments of this world and the rapture of participation in a manner of being beyond time. For all the symbolic narratives, images, rites, and festivals by which life within the cultural monad is controlled and defined are of the order of the way of art. Their effect, therefore, is to wake the intellect to re alizations equivalent to those of the insights that produced them. In a paper by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, introduced by a quotation from Walt Whitman-"These things are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me"-the point is made with respect to the metaphorical language of mythology and metaphysics that "its 'worlds' and 'gods' are levels of reference and symbolic entities which are neither places nor individuals but states of being realizable within yo u . " 7 A mythology is, in this sense, an organization of metaphorical figures connotative of states of mind that are not finally of this or that place and time, notwithstanding that the figures themselves initially suggest such lo calization. My magnificent master and great friend of many years ago, Heinrich Zimmer (1890-1943) , had a saying: "The best things can't be told: the second best are misunderstood." The second best are misunderstood because, as metaphors poetically of that which cannot be told, they are mis read prosaically as referring to tangible facts. The connoted messages are thus lost in the symbols, the elementary ideas in local "ethnic" inflections. Inevitably, in the popular mind, where such metaphors of transcendence become known only as represented in the rituals and legends of the local, mythologically inspired control system, the whole sense of the symbology re mains locked to local practical aims and ethical ideals, in the function chiefly of controlling, socializing, and harmonizing in strictly local terms the primitive



XXIV Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp a c e
bioenergies o f the human animal, to the popular ends o f health, progeny, and prosperity as the proper aims of a human life. Whereas, in fundamental con trast, the way of the mystic and of proper art (and we might also add, religion) is ofrecognizing through the metaphors an epiphany beyond words. For, as told in the Kena Upani�ad: "There the eye goes not, speech goes not, nor the mind. We know not, nor can we imagine, how to convey it. For it is other than the known; also, beyond the unknown. Thus we have heard from the ancients, who have told of it. . . . Ifknown here, then there is truth; ifnot known, there is great destruction. The wise, discerning it in allbeings, become on departing this world, immortal." 8 For some reason which I have not yet found anywhere explained, the popular, unenlightened practice of prosaic reification of metaphoric im agery has been the fundamental method of the most influential exegetes of the whole Judeo-Christian-lslamic mythic complex. The idea of the Virgin Birth, for example, is argued as a historical fact, whereas in practically every mythology of the world instances have appeared of this elementary idea. American Indian mythologies abound in virgin births. Therefore, the in tended reference of the archetypal image cannot possibly have been to a supposed occurrence in the Near East in the first century B.C. The elemen tary idea, likewise, of the Promised Land cannot originally have referred to a part of this earth to be conquered by military might, but to a place of spir itual peace in the heart, to be discovered through contemplation. Creation myths, furthermore, which, when read in their mystical sense might bring to mind the idea of a background beyond time out ofwhich the whole tem poral world with its colorful populations has been derived, when read, in stead, historically, only j ustify as supernaturally endowed the moral order of some local culture. In short, the social, as opposed to the mystical func tion of a mythology, is not to open the mind, but to enclose it: to bind a local people together in mutual support by offering images that awaken the heart to recognitions of commonality, without allowing these to escape the monadic compound. It is surely evident, therefore, that whatever the future mythology of our soon-to-be-unified planet may be, its story of creation and the evolution of civilizations shall not be turned to the magnification of any one, two, or three ofthe innumerable monadic instances in the vast polymorphic display.



In trodu ctio n xxv
Our scientists and historians have already laid out the plot. And the way in which the monads there appear and melt away in the vision of a single mighty presence playing hide-and-seek with itself on the ever-turning stage of what James Joyce in Finnegans Wake has called "The Hereweareagain Gaieties" 9 is a rapture to behold. For as the various ethnic forms dissolve, it is the image of androgynous Anthropos that emerges through and among them. "Surely, " as the poet Yeats perceived, "some revelation is at hand." Meanwhile, however, in the old Near East, where in Sargon's time the idea appears to have first been implemented of politically exploitive wars of territorial conquest, contending armies of the only three monotheistic monads of the planet (each dedicated to a notion of its own historically conditioned idea of "God" as having been from all eternity, in very fact, that to which, not words, nor the eye, nor the mind can reach) in this deli cate moment of imminent global unification, "Year of Our Lord" (A.D.) 1985, are threatening the whole process of global unification with the ad venture of their scripturally prophesied Armageddon.
Surely some revelation is at hand. Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight; somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? 10






CHAPTER I
CosMOLOGY AND THE
MY THIC IMAGINATION
It was a startling experience for me, as it must have been for many others watching the television broadcast of the Apollo spaceflight immediately be fore that of Armstrong's landing on the moon, when Ground Control in Houston asked, "Who's navigating now?" and the answer that came back was, "Newton!" I was reminded of Immanuel Kant's discussion of space in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysic, where he asks: " How is it that in this space, here, we can make judgments that we know with apodictic certainty will be valid in that space, there?" 1 The little module was out beyond the moon. That was a part of space that no one had ever before visited. Yet the scientists in Houston knew ex actly how much energy to eject from those jets, when turned in j ust what direction, to bring the module down from outer space to within a mile of a battleship waiting for it in the Pacific Ocean. Kant's reply to the question was that the laws of space are known to the mind because they are ofthe mind. They are of a knowledge that is within us from birth, a knowledge a priori, which is only brought to recollection by apparently external circumstance. During the following flight, when Armstrong's booted foot came down to leave its imprint on the surface of



2 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp ace
the moon, no one knew how deeply it might sink into lunar dust. That was to be knowledge a posteriori, knowledge from experience, knowledge after the event. But how to bring the module down, and how to get it up there, had been known from the beginning. Moreover, those later spacecraft that are now cruising far out beyond the moon, in what is known as outer space! It is known exactly how to maneuver them, to bring messages back, to turn them around, even to correct their faults. In other words, it then occurred to me that outer space is within inas much as the laws of space are within us; outer and inner space are the same. We know, furthermore, that we have actually been born from space, since it was out of primordial space that the galaxy took form, of which our life-giving sun is a member. And this earth, ofwhose material we are made, is a flying satellite of that sun. We are, in fact, productions of this earth. We are, as it were, its organs. Our eyes are the eyes of this earth; our knowl edge is the earth's knowledge. And the earth, as we now know, is a pro duction of space. Alerted by such remotely intimate thoughts, and deciding to learn something more (a posteriori) about the anatomy of our great-grandmother, Space, I turned for information to that remarkable world atlas (actually, an atlas of the universe) , which had been issued as the fifth edition (1981) of the National Geographic Atlas ofthe World. I had thought myself already some what informed of the findings of those scientists who man the great tele scopes on our mountaintops (the eyes and ears of our planet) ; but what I learned from the first fifteen pages of that volume amazed me. There is one two-page spread on which our solar system is pictured, and then the galaxy of billions of stars within which this solar system rides, and then the cluster of twenty galaxies of which our galaxy is a member, which local cluster, in turn, is represented as but one of thousands of such local clusters of galaxies, themselves gathered in superclusters in a universe whose limits are not yet known. What those pages opened to me, in short, was the vision of a universe of unimaginable magnitude and inconceivable violence: billions upon billions-literally!-of roaring thermonuclear furnaces scattering from each other, each thermonuclear furnace being a star, and our sun among them: many of them actually blowing themselves to pieces, littering the outermost reaches of space with dust and gas, out of which new stars



Cosmo logy a n d the Mythic Imaginatio n 3
with circling planets are being born right now. And then, from still more remote distances, beyond all these, there come murmurs-microwaves which are echoes of the greatest cataclysmic explosion of all, namely the Big Bang of creation, which, according to recent reckonings, must have occurred some r8 billion years ago. The Big Bang of creation! Out of what did it arise? The account resembles, in a way, that of the first verses ofthe Latin poet Ovid's Metamorphoses (composed in the first decade A.D.), where he writes that originally there was a formless chaos of miscellaneous elements, dis arranged, vaguely floating; and that deus, a "god," brought order out of this chaos, sending the elements-fire, air, water, and earth-to their places. From the atlas (and then some further reading) I learned that, origi nally, what has been described both as a "great featureless mass" and (more mysteriously and, therefore, perhaps more accurately) as an "impulse" (Ovid's deus} reached a maximum of concentration that could be sustained no more than a billionth of a second when (and right here, the Big Bang) the inconceivable pressure of an entire incipient universe confined to a single point became converted into energy and mass, the primal twin man ifestations of all perceived "reality" in what is known to the mind as space time (Sanskrit, miiyii). 2 A sphere of ravening intensity began spreading at the speed of light and, as "space" cooled, within the first second, muons and neutrinos had been followed by protons and neutrons, with nuclei cap turing electrons and atoms coming into existence. The degree of heat was indescribable. It has been cooling ever since, while the whole event con tinues to expand with its initial velocity. And so we come to the picture of this universe today, as disclosed by those marvelous instruments put to use by our astronomers, which are de livering to them a revelation of millions of spinning galaxies, many as great as our Milky Way and each with billions of stars, all moving at prodigious rates away from one another, and with no stillpoint anywhere. An epochal series of experiments conducted in Ohio in the middle r88os (published r887) by two American scientists, A. A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (the Michelson-Morley experiment) , which had demonstrated definitively that the classic notion could no longer be entertained of a universal ether against which interstellar velocities might be comparatively measured, resulted in 1905 in Albert Einstein's founding statement of the modern



4 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Spa c e
theory of relativity: " I t i s impossible b y any experiment whatsoever to d� termine absolute rest. " Any place you like may be chosen for your hypo thetical still point, and from any such tentative, operational center, what you would see would be this streaming away of those myriads of galaxies going into distance, the furthest of them at such distances that, finally, our greatest telescopes lose track of them entirely-the light coming from them arriving so late that their present positions are out of sight. And so now, of all the possible centers, our own eanh, of course, is the only one available to us. Revolving on its own axis once every twenty-four hours, rhis operational still point is annually circling one of rhe several hundred billion suns that constitute our galaxy, this sun itself meanwhile traveling at the rate of 136 miles per second around the periphery of our na tive galaxy, circling it once every 230 million years. The diameter of this galaxy, this Milky Way of exploding stars, is now described as IOo,ooo light years, a light year being the distance light travels in one year. Bur light travels at the rate of 186,ooo miles per second, and the number of seconds in a year (if I calculate correctly) is 31,557,600. So that if we multiply 186,ooo miles by 31,557, 6oo seconds, we arrive at the idea of one light year, which is, namely (if again I calculate correctly) , 5 trillion, 869 billion, 713 million, 6oo thousand miles. And 1oo,ooo of these will then amount to 586 quadrillion, 971 trillion, 360 billion (586,971,36o,ooo,ooo,ooo) miles. And within this galaxy of that diameter, the nearest sun to our sun, near est star to our star, is Alpha in Centauri, which is about 4 light years, which is to say, a mere 25 trillion miles, away. From our position in this inconceivable galaxy, when we look up at night ar the Milky Way, we are sighting, as it were, along the radius of a great disk. The other stars that we see in the night sky are members also of this galaxy, but are situated to one side or the other of the crosscut. And this disk, this galaxy of which our sun is a minor member, is bur one of what is known to science as a "local group" of galaxies, the number in our particular group being twenty: twenty Milky Ways of billions of exploding nuclear furnaces, flying from each other through spaces not to be meas ured, the universe (of which we speak so easily) comprising, literally, quin tillions of such self-consuming stars. And so now we must ask: What does all this do to mythology? Obviously, some corrections have to be made.



Cosmo logy a n d the My th ic Imagi n a tio n
For example: It is believed that Jesus, having risen from the dead, as cended physically to heaven (Luke 24: 51) , to be followed shortly by his mother in her sleep (Early Christian belief, confirmed as Roman Catholic dogma on November 1, 1950) . It is also written that some nine centuries earlier, Elij ah, riding a chariot of fire, had been carried to heaven in a whirl wind (2 Kings 2:11) . Now, even ascending at the speed of light, which for a physical body is impossible, those three celestial voyagers would not yet be out of the galaxy. Dante in the year A.D. 1300 spent the Easter weekend in a visit to hell, purgatory, and heaven; but that voyage was in spirit alone, his body remaining on earth. Whereas Jesus, Mary, and Elijah are declared to have ascended physically. What is to be made today of such mythological (hence, metaphorical) folk ideas? Obviously, if anything of value is to be made of them at all (and I sub mit that the elementary original idea must have been something of this kind) , where those bodies went was not into outer space, but into inner space. That is to say, what is connoted by such metaphorical voyages is the possibility of a return of the mind in spirit, while still incarnate, to full knowledge of that transcendent source out ofwhich the mystery of a given life arises into this field of time and back into which it in time dissolves. It is an old, old story in mythology: of the Alpha and Omega that is the ground of all being, to be realized as the beginning and end of this life. The imagery is necessarily physical and thus apparently of outer space. The in herent connotation is always, however, psychological and metaphysical, which is to say, of inner space. When read as denoting merely specified events, therefore, the mirrored inward images lose their inherent spiritual force and, becoming overloaded with sentiment, only bind the will the more to temporality. There is a beautiful saying of Navalis: "The seat of the soul is there, where the outer and the inner worlds meet." That is the wonderland of myth. From the outer world the senses carry images to the mind, which do not become myth, however, until there transformed by fusion with ac cordant insights, awakened as imagination from the inner world of the body. The Buddhists speak of Buddha Realms. These are planes and or ders of consciousness that can be brought to mind through meditations on appropriately mythologized forms. Plato tells of universal ideas, the



6 Th e In n e r Reaches of O u ter Spa c e
memory ofwhich i s lost a t birth b u t through philosophy may b e recalled. 3 These correspond to Bastian's "elementary ideas" and 1ung's "archetypes of the collective unconscious. " In India, as noticed by Ananda K. Coomarasway,4 works of art representing indifferent objects, local per sonages and scenes, such as fill the walls and rooms of most of our muse ums, have been characterized as deli ("local, popular, provincial") or as niigara ("fashionable, worldly") and are regarded as esthetically insignifi cant; whereas those representing deities or revered ancestors, such as might appear in temples or on domestic shrines, are perceived as tokens of an inward, spiritual "way" or "path," termed miirga, which is a word derived from the vocabulary of the hunt, denoting the tracks or trail of an animal, by following which the hunter comes to his quarry. Similarly, the images of deities, which are but local forms of "elementary ideas," are footprints left, as it were, by local passages of the "Universal Self" (iitman), through contemplating which the worshiper attains "Self-Rapture" (iitmiinananda). A passage from Plotinus may be quoted to this point: "Not all who perceive with eyes the sensible products of art are affected alike by the same object, but if they know it for the outward por trayal of an archetype subsisting in intuition, their hearts are shaken and they recapture memory of that Original . " 5 All mythologies, finally, are works of art of this order and effect. Sociologically and psychologically, however, it makes a great difference what images they present; for the degree of their opening of inner space is a function of the reach into outer space that they unclose. In the earliest, most limited and limiting mythologies of which we have knowledge, for example, the horizons are local and tribal. Such mythologies are neither ad dressed to, nor concerned with, humanity at large. The tribe and its land scape are the universe. Read again the first, second, third, and fourth chapters of the Book of Genesis. Such a tiny, minute affair! What relation does such a cosmology bear to the universe now perceived? Or to the his tories of any but one of the people of this earth? As stated unequivocally in 2 Kings 5=15, "There is no God in all the earth but in Israel. " For at that time the center of the universe was 1erusalem. And the center of1erusalem was the Temple. And the center of the Temple was the Holy of Holies in the Temple. And the center of the Holy of Holies was the Ark of the



Cosmology a n d the Mythic Imagina tio n 7
Covenant therein. And the foundation of the universe was the Stone that was there before the Ark. Mythologically, metaphorically, that was a per fectly good cultic image. But it had nothing to do with the universe, or with the rest of the peoples of this planet. Then came the year A.D. 70, the catastrophic destruction by the Romans of both Jerusalem and its temple and, following that, the historic dispersion of God's people among the Gentiles, the so-called Diaspora (Hebrew, galut, the "exile") , which threatened the very subsistence of what had been called in Ezra's time, the "holy race" (Ezra 9 : 12) . Two subsequent centuries of rabbinical consultation, dialogue, and debate, however, as reg istered in the Mishna (that third century compilation of authoritative post-biblical laws, judgments, and determinations) sufficed to rescue the tradition by an adroit redefinition. The center now was to be known, not as a place, but as a people; not the Temple or the Ark, which meanwhile had disappeared, but the Israelite community over the earth. And so again in strictly ethnocentric terms, a tribal concept of the universe, its history, and its destiny (now highly intentional and sophisticated) was devised, having as its central feature the one and only holy thing upon all this earth: these people, themselves, of God's holy race. In aboriginal societies, the tribal myths, while unexceptionally ethno centric, do not anywhere exhibit such an exclusive fascination with the people themselves; for every feature of the landscape, the whole world of nature and everything around them, is encompassed in their regard. The earth for them is not of dust (Genesis 3=19), but alive and a mother. The animals and plants, and all the peoples dwelling on her bosom, are her children, also regarded in a sacred way. Moreover, the laws by which the people live, though from their ancestors and proper to themselves, do not elevate them beyond nature; nor are the gods and habits of their neighbors viewed as abominations (Ezra 9:1 and passim) . Local cult and custom are recognized for what they are-namely, relative, not absolute-so that, although indeed limited and limiting, they may open the mind and heart to the world. For example: There is an important little volume by the Nebraskan poet John Neihardt, Black Elk Speaks, in which the prophetic boyhood vision is re counted of an old Sioux medicine man, Keeper of the Sacred Pipe of his people, who at one point declared that in imagination he had seen himself



8 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Space
standing on the central mountain of the world, which in his view, of course, was nowhere near Jerusalem, but Harney Peak, in the Black Hills of South Dakota. And while there, "I was seeing in a sacred manner," he said, "the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all things as they must live together, like one being. And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shel ter all the children of one mother and one father. " 6 Thus from the humanity of an awakened inner eye and consciousness, a vision released from the limitations of its local, tribal horizon might open to the world and even to transcendence. For, as Black Elk remarked to Neihardt when telling of this vision beheld from Harney Peak, South Dakota, as center of the world: "But anywhere is the center of the world. " 7 There, I would say, was a true prophet, who knew the difference be tween his ethnic ideas and the elementary ideas that they enclose, between a metaphor and its connotation, between a tribal myth and its metaphysi cal import. For when the inner eye is awakened and a revelation arises from inner space to meet impressions brought by the senses from outer space to the mind, the significance of the conj unction is lost unless the outward image opens to receive and embody the elementary idea-this being the whole sense of the transformation of nature in art. Otherwise, nothing has happened; an external event has been merely documented and a cultic, eth nic centricity given as the last word of religion, with naturalism the end and beginning of art. A decisive, enormous leap out of the confines of all local histories and landscapes occurred in Mesopotamia in the fourth millennium B.C., dur ing the period of the rise of the ziggurats, those storied temple towers, sym bolic of the axis mundi, which are caricatured in the Bible as the Tower of Babel. The leap was from geography to the cosmos, beyond the moon, whereupon the primal, limited, and limiting tribal manner of thought (which the Hebrew prophets chose deliberately to retain) was by the Gentile civilizations left behind. That was the period when writing was in vented; also, mathematical measurement, and the wheel. The priestly watchers of the night skies at that time were the first in the world to rec ognize that there is a mathematical regularity in the celestial passages of the seven visible spheres-the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,



Cos m o logy a n d the Myth ic Im agi n a tio n 9
and Saturn-along the heaven-way of the Zodiac. And with that, the idea dawned of a cosmic order, mathematically discoverable, which it should be the function of a governing priesthood to translate from its heavenly reve lation into an order of civilized human life. The idea of the hieratic city-state made its appearance at that time, with kings and queens symbol ically attired, enacting together with their courts an aristocratic mime in imitation of the celestial display, the king crowned as the moon or sun, his queen and the other members of their court as planetary presences. And those allegorical identifications were taken seriously to such a degree that when celestial signs appeared that were interpreted as marking the end of an eon, the kings and queens, together with their courts, were ceremoni ously buried alive. Sir James G. Frazer, in The Golden Bough (12 volumes, I90TI915) , published evidence from many parts of the world of the prac tice of such rites. Buried courts have been unearthed from Sumer and Egypt to China. Some notion of the whole profoundly conceived, macro-microcosmic import of such courtly mimes may be gained from a consideration of the mathematics of the mythological and actual cycles of the calendars to which such rites were attached. For example, in the Hindu sacred epics and Pura.Q.as (popular tellings of ancient lore) , the number of years reckoned to the present cycle of time, the so-called Kali Yuga, is 432,000; the number reckoned to the "great cycle" (mahayuga) within which this yuga falls being 4,320,000. But then reading one day in the Icelandic Eddas, I discovered that in Othin's (Wotan's) warrior hall, Valholl, there were 540 doors, through each of which, on the "Day of the Wolf" (that is to say, at the end of the present cycle of time) , there would pass 8oo divine warriors to en gage the antigods in a battle of mutual annihilation. 8 8oo x 540 = 432,000. And so I asked myselfhow it might ever have come to pass that in tenth-to thirteenth century Iceland the same number of years were reckoned to the present cycle of time as in India. In Babylon, I then recalled, there had been a Chaldean priest, Berossos, who, .c. 280 B.c., had rendered into Greek an account of the history and mythology of Babylonia, wherein it was told that between the time of the rise of the first city, Kish, and the coming of the Babylonian mythological flood (from which that of the Bible is taken) , there elapsed 432,000 years, during which antediluvian era, ten kings reigned. Very long



ro Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp a c e
lives! Longer even than Methuselah's (Genesis 5:27) , which had been of only 969. So I turned to the Old Testament (Genesis 5) and counting the num ber of antediluvian patriarchs, Adam to Noah, discovered, of course, that they were ten. How many years? Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth, who was 105 when he begat Enosh, and so on, to Noah, who was 6oo years old when the flood carne: to a grand total, from the first day ofAdam's creation to the first drop of rain of Noah's flood, of 1,656 years. Any rela tion to 432,000? Julius Oppen, a distinguished Jewish Assyriologist of the last century, in 1877 presented before the Royal Society for Sciences in Gottingen a paper on "Dates in Genesis," 9 in which it was shown that in 1,656 years there are 86,400 seven-day weeks. 86,400 + 2 = 43 ,200.
ANTED I LUVIAN AGE WHEN AGE AT TIME PATRIARCH BEGETTING SoN O F D EATH
1. Adam (Genesis 5:3-5) 130 930 2. Seth (ib. 5:6-8) 105 912 3· Enosh (ib. 5:9-n) 90 905 4· Kenon (ib. 5: 12-14) 70 910 5· Mahalalel (ib. 5:15-17) 65 895 6.

Grand Total from Creation: 1,656 years to year of the Flood.
And so it appears that in the Book of Genesis there are two contrary the ologies represented in relation to the legend of the Deluge. One is the old tribal, popular tale of a willful, personal creator-god, who saw that "the wickedness of man was great in the earth . . . and was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them' " (Genesis 6:5-7). The other idea, which is in fundamental contrast, is that of the disguised number, 86,400, which is a deeply hidden reference to



Cos m o logy a n d th e Myth ic Im agi n a tio n n
the Gentile, Sumero-Babylonian, mathematical cosmology of the ever revolving cycles of impersonal time, with whole universes and their popula tions coming into being, flowering for a season of 43,200 (432,000 or 4.32o,ooo) years, dissolving back into the cosmic mother-sea to rest for an equal spell of years before returning, and so again, again, and again. The Jews, it will be remembered, were for fifty years exiled from their capital to Babylon (586-539 B.c.), when they were subject, willy nilly, to Babylonian influences, so that although the popular, exoteric version of their Deluge leg end is from the period of David's kingdom, tenth century or so B.c., the ex quisitely secreted indication of a priestly knowledge, beyond that, of a larger, cyclic version of the legend-where the god himself would have come into being and gone out of being with the universe ofwhich he was the lord-is post-Exilic, as are, also, the genealogical datings of Genesis chapter 5, which are so very nicely contrived to join the 6oo years of Noah's age at the time of the Flood to furnish a total exactly of I,6s6. It is to be noticed, by the way, that I + 6 + 5 + 6 = I8, which is twice 9, while 4 + 3 + 2 = 9: 9 being a number traditionally associated with the Goddess Mother of the World and its gods. In India the number of recited names in a litany of this goddess is 108. I + o + 8 = 9, while 108 x 4 = 432. In Roman Catholic Europe, when the Angelus tolls (at morning, noon, and evening) , it rings 3 + 3 + 3 and then 9 times, in celebration of the Virgin's conception of the Savior. The recited prayer at those junctures, "The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, and she conceived by the Holy Ghost. . . . and THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH . . . " is in recognition of this miracle at the opening of a new world age. In ancient Greece, 9 was the number of the Muses, patron goddesses of the arts. They were the daughters of Mnemosyne ("memory"), the source of imagination, which in turn is the carrier ofarchetypal, elementary ideas to artistic realization in the field of space-time. The number 9, that is to say, relates traditionally to the Great Goddess of Many Names (Devi, Inanna, Ishtar, Astarte, Artemis, Venus, etc.) , as matrix of the cosmic process, whether in the macrocosm or in a microcosmic field of manifestation. The reason for the suppression of her image by a clergy interested in the claims only of a divinity heavily bearded, therefore, can be readily surmised; but why the same company of priestly doctors so artfully concealed in their document an unmistakable notice of their own knowledge of her power awaits interpretation.



12 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Sp a ce
The profundity and sublime majesty of the suppressed mythology can be appreciated best by way of two apparently unrelated clocks, one, the ultimate clock of outer space, and the other of inner space-respectively, the astronomical precession of the equinoxes and the physiological beat of the human heart. Regarding the first: the slow westward motion, in the course of years, of the equinoctial points around the beltway of the zodiac (the vernal equinox, for example, moving from the sign of Aries, where it had been before the birth of Christ, through Pisces, where it is now, to ward Aquarius, where it will be in a couple of hundred years) , requires for one complete cycle of the twelve zodiacal signs exactly 25,920 years, which term is known as a "great" or " Platonic" year. But if we divide 25,920 by 6o (which is the ancient Mesopotamian soss, or basic sexagesimal unit of astronomical measurement, still used in the measurement of circles, whether of time or of space) , the quotient is 432. Moreover: 2 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 0 = 18. And regarding the second, the inward clock: I have read in a popular book on physical education that "A conditioned man, who exercises regu larly, will have a resting heart rate of about 6o beats per minute or less. . . . Sixty per minute times 6o minutes, equals 3,6oo beats per hour. Times 24 hours, equals 86,400 beats a day. " 10 It is strange that in our history books the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes should be attributed always to the Greek Hipparchus, sec ond century B.C., when the magic number 432 (which when multiplied by 6o produces 25,920) was already employed in the reckoning of major cycles of time before that century. How long before, we do not know. But the Chaldean priest Berossos was of the early third century B.c., and the mythology of which he wrote the account was allegedly of Babylon before its conquest by the Persians in 539 B.C. Babylonian mythology, further more, was a late development out of the very much earlier Sumerian of c. 30oo-20oo B.c.; and our earliest known legend of the universal flood is from Sumer. To suggest that already in the ziggurats of Sumer the priests were reckoning in terms of the precession of the equinoxes would be per haps too bold. There is every reason to believe, however, that the mythol ogy into which, at some unknown date, the astonishingly accurate numerical insight was introduced had been Sumerian, indeed even possi bly pre-Sumerian; for by the end of the third millennium B.c. it was



Cos m o logy a n d th e Myth ic Im agi n a tio n 13
already known to all the civilizations at that time in flower from the Nile valley and Aegean Sea to the Indus. The mystery of the night sky, those enigmatic passages of slowly but steadily moving lights among the fixed stars, had delivered the revelation, when charted mathematically, of a cosmic order, and in response, from the depths of the human imagination, a reciprocal recognition had been evoked. A vast concept took form of the universe as a living being in the likeness of a great mother, within whose womb all the worlds, both of life and of death, had their existence (see Figure 1) . And the human body is in miniature a duplicate of that macrocosmic form. So that throughout the whole an occult harmony prevails, which it is the function of a mythology and relevant rites to make known. The Chinese idea of the tao is a devel opment out of this macro-microcosmic insight. Hinduism in all its aspects carries into every act of life the idea of dharma ("virtue") as conformity to the caste laws of one's birth, which are understood to be, not of social in vention, but given of nature, like the laws of action of the various animal species. The noun dharma is from a verbal root dhri ("to hold, to bear, to support") . For by conforming perfectly to one's dharma {sva-dharma), as do the various animal species to theirs, the plants to theirs, and the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars to theirs, one at once supports the universe and is supported by it. And so, indeed, in our modern Western world, when a doctor takes a patient's pulse, if the beat is sixty a minute (43 ,200 in twelve hours) , it is the pulse of a conditioned athlete in accord at once with his own nature and with the rhythm of the universe: the function of medicine, like that of mythology and ritual, being to keep mankind in ac cord with the natural order.* Well and good enough, one might suppose! However-and here is where the West begins-a radical and enormously influential ethical protest against the uncritical submission to the will in nature that is im plicit in this finally mystical world vision broke forth in Iran, some time in
* A startling microcosmic revelation of the mystic force of this number came recently to light when engineers in the Wilson Sporting Goods laboratories testing (for distance) golf balls with anywhere from 30 to 1,212 dimples were advised by computer that the optimum number would be 432. For indeed, the Wilson 432 golf ball has been found by profes sionals to lengthen their drives some ten to thirteen or more yards.

the second or first millenium B.C. , i n the dualistic religious VIew of Zarathustra (known to the Greeks as Zoroaster) . The dates of this earliest known prophet of an absolute distinction between good and evil-in con trast to the cosmological, mystical insight-are in dispute. Some scholars place him c. 1200 B.c. ; others, six to seven centuries later. In either case, the god of light and truth and justice whose gospel he preached, Ahura Mazda, was the god professed by the Persian King of Kings, Darius I (ruled 521-486 B.c.) , during whose reign the first moves were undertaken to return the Jews to Jerusalem; and that Zoroastrian patterns of thought and verbal stereo types were absorbed into Pharasaic as well as into Essene Judaism, there is today no question. The recently discovered Essene Dead Sea Scroll known as "The War of the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness," for example, is a classic instance of Zoroastrian ethical dualism, fused, however, with the Jewish tribal notion of themselves as the one and only people of God. As the "Sons of Light," at the end of time, in a holy war of exactly thirty-five years with a year of rest every seventh, they are to attack and overcome in programmed stages, with timely help from the great hand of God, all the Gentile nations, the "Sons of Darkness," of this earth.

Below are the purgatories and above the heavens to which "souls" (jivas) descend or ascend between incarnations, according to their lives. Ahimsa, "non-inj ury, or nonviolence," is for the Jains the determining virtue. The aim is to ascend, completely cleansed of impulse to "action," (karma), to the gaining of "release" (mo/eya) from the "round of rebirths" (samsiira) in the removed realm here shown as above the brows of the cosmic being. This "release" is not conceived of in Jainism as it is in Hinduism and Buddhism, as a nirvii�a of nonentiry, but as kaivalyam, a state of uncondi tioned, isolated perfection in timeless omniscience. Mahavira (c. 599-527 B.c.), last of the twenty-four founding "Conquerors" (jinas), or teachers of the way to this victory, was an older contemporary of the Buddha (c. 563-483 B.c.) . The number of his named predecessors reaches back beyond historical time imo ages purely mythological. There can be no doubt that already in the period of the Indus Civilization, c. 2300-1750 B.C., there were in I ndia practitioners of an austere type of yoga who may indeed have been of the Jina line.

F o r according to Zarathustra, there were two creator-gods-a good god, Ahura Mazda, of light, of truth, and ofjustice, and an evil god, Angra Mainyu, of darkness, deception, and malice. In the beginning, Ahura Mazda created a universe of virtue and light, which Angra Mainyu then maliciously corrupted; so that the world in which we live is mixed of good and evil. Man is therefore not to put himself in accord with nature-as in the ancient and oriental worlds-but to make a decision for the good, put himself in accord with the good, fight for justice and the light, and correct nature. The nature of the first man, Gayomart, was corrupted by the malice of Angra Mainyu. Man, therefore, is "fallen man." His nature is not to be trusted. A great prophet, however, Zarathustra, has come into the world, born, they say, of a virgin, who has taught the way of virtue which is to lead in the end to a restoration ofAhura Mazda's uncorrupted universe. In a prodigious final battle, the powers of light and justice, led by a radiant reincarnation, Saoshyant, of the seed of the prophet Zarathustra, born again of a virgin, will engage, overwhelm, and destroy the whole produc tion of Angra Mainyu, indeed even Angra Mainyu himself. The universe will be cleared of darkness, and the dead, now purged of death, will be res urrected as bodies radiant of uncorrupted being. Thus a completely new mythology arose, and instead of the ancient Sumero-Babylonian contemplation of the disappearances and reappear ances of planets as revelatory of an order of nature with which society was to be held in accord, an idea of good and evil, light and dark, even of life and death as separable took hold, and the prophecy was announced of a progressive restoration to righteousness of the order of nature. Where for merly there had been the planetary cycles, marking days and nights, the months, years, and eons of unending time, there was now to be a straight line of progressive world history with a beginning, a middle, and a proph esied end-Gayomart, Zarathustra, and Saoshyant: Adam, Jesus, and the Second Coming. Where formerly there had been, as the ideal, harmony with the whole, there was now discrimination, a decision to be made, "not peace, but a sword" (Matthew 10:34) , effort, struggle, and zeal, in the name of a universal reform. In the Persian empire this ethical world-ideal became identified with the political aims of the King of Kings himself, who reigned as the regent of Ahura Mazda; in Christendom, by a sort of spiritual



Cos m o logy a n d the My th ic Imagi n a tio n 17
contagion, Gott mit uns has ever been the war cry of every national army, on both sides of the line; while throughout the territorial reaches of Islam, the rhetoric of righteousness has been epitomized in the matched phrases, dar al'isliim ("the realm of submission [to Allah]") and dar al'harb ("the realm of war") , which is to say, the rest of the world. And so throughout the complex of mythologies now operative in the West-which by virture of their common impulse to missionary imperial ism are today reshaping the planet, save where the no less reformational zeal of the mission of Karl Marx has taken over the enterprise-the reaches of outer space to which the religious mind is formally directed are not cos mic, but geographical, and defined in terms, moreover, of dark and light, God's portion (dar al'isliim) and the devil's (dar al'harb); prayers still being addressed in all seriousness to a named and defined masculine personality inhabiting a local piece of sky a short flight beyond the moon. Meanwhile, certain spiritually significant changes have occurred in the psychophysical environment of our species. The first, of course, followed the publication, A.D. 1543, of Copernicus's "Six Books on the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs" (De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri VI), when the sun displaced the earth at the center of God's universe; so that, whereas our eyes see the sun rise daily in the east, hang high in the heavens at noon, and go down in glory in the west, what our brains now know is nothing of the kind. With that fateful publication, the recognized idea of the earth in relation to outer space became forever separated from the daily experience of the same. An intellectual concept had refuted and displaced the never theless persistent sensory percept. The heliocentric universe has never been translated into a mythology. Science and religion have therewith gone apart. And that is the case to the present hour, with the problem even com pounded by our present recognition of the inconceivable magnitude of this galaxy of stars, ofwhich our life-giving sun is a peripheral member, circling with its satellites in this single galaxy among millions within a space of in credible distances, having no fixed form or end. "Have you not heard," asked Nietzsche, already in the introduction to his Thus Spake Zarathustra (r883-84) : "Have you not yet heard that God is dead?"-the god in point, of course, being the named and defined creator-god of the historically limited Bible. For the conditions, not only of life, but of thought also, have considerably changed since the centuries



18 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp ace
of the composition of that guide to truth and virtue, which with its delib erately restricted and restricting ethnocentric horizon and tribal "jealous God" (Exodus 20: 5) is culture specific to such a degree that its "folk ideas" and "elementary ideas" are inseparably fused. The first step to mystical realization is the leaving of such a defined god for an experience of transcendence, disengaging the ethnic from the elementary idea, for any god who is not transparent to transcendence is an idol and its worship is idolatry. Also, the first step to participation in the destiny of humanity today, which is neither of this folk nor of that, but of the whole population of this globe, is to recognize every such local image of a god as but one of many thousands, millions, even perhaps billions, of locally useful symbolizations of that same mystery beyond sight or thought which our teachers have taught us to seek in their god alone. Black Elk's phrase, "The center is everywhere," is matched by a statement from a her metic, early medieval text, The Book ofthe Twenty-four Philosophers (Liber XXIVphilosophorum): " God is an infinite sphere, whose center is every where and circumference nowhere." 12 The idea, it seems to me, is in a most appropriate way illustrated in that stunning photograph (Figure 2) taken from the moon, and now frequently reproduced, of an earthrise, the earth rising as a radiant celestial orb , strewing light over a lunar landscape. Is the center the earth? Is the center the moon? The center is anywhere you like. Moreover, in that photograph from its own satellite, the rising earth shows none of those divisive territorial lines that on our maps are so con spicuous and important. The chosen center may be anywhere. The Holy Land is no special place. It is every place that has ever been recognized and mythologized by any people as home. Moreover, this understanding of the ubiquity of the metaphysical cen ter perfectly matches the lesson of the galaxies and of the Michelson-Morley finding that was epitomized in Einstein's representation of the utter impos sibility of establishing absolute rest. It is the essence of relativity. And, when translated from the heavens to this earth, it implies that moral judgments depend likewise upon the relation of the frame of reference to the person or act being measured. "Judge not that you be not judged" (Matthew 7:1). There is no absolute good or evil. So that, as Nietzsche has suggested, if Zarathustra were to return today, his message would not be of good and evil as absolutes. The lesson of his first teaching, which was of integrity, has



Cos m o logy a n d the My thic Im agi n a tio n 19
been learned. The lesson now, beyond good and evil, is to be of life. For as Nietzsche himself stated: "All ideals are dangerous, since they denigrate and stigmatize what is actual. They are poisons, which, however, as occasional medicaments, are indispensable." 13

And so, in mythological terms, what is to happen now? All of our old gods are dead, and the new have not yet been born. There is a medieval Hindu story in one of the Puriir:tas, the Brahmavaivarta Purii.I)a, of about the fifth century A. D., wh ich concerns the



20 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
Vedic-Aryan tribal deity Indra, who is a mythological counterpart in India of Yahweh in the Near East, also of Olympian Zeus of the ancient Greeks, Ashur of the Assyrians, Tarhun of the Hittites, and so forth. Those were all guardian family gods of the various nomadic herding tribes that throughout the second millennium B.C. were invading and as suming control of the cultivated lands and their temple-cities, all the way from southeastern Europe, across Asia Minor and the Near East, to the Indus Valley. The chief gods of the invaders were predominantly male warrior gods, champions, each, of his special people. Those of the invaded agricultural territories, in contrast, were chiefly of the earth's fertility and life, local forms, for the most part, of the one great "Goddess of Many Names" (as she was later termed) , of whom all beings, even gods and demons, are the progeny. Divinities of her kind are the local representatives of those powers of nature that indeed are the creative energies of all life. They are not of this day or that, but forever. Mythologies of the every-returning cycles of unending time are everywhere of her order of being. So, too, are the mystical philosophies and meditational disciplines of the inward, indi vidual quest for identification with the ground of one's own and the world's existence. In fundamental contrast, the sociological tribal gods are of a secondary, local-historical definition and relevance. They are of this people or that, this moment or that in the vast history of the universe. Moreover, their dwelling is not, and can never be, inward of nature, in the way of an immanent, pantheistic presence domiciled in the heart as the actuality of its life. As guardians, they are always invoked from "out there." They are lawgivers, support-givers to those they favor and to those alone, since they are not of nature, but of a people. Consequently, when such a secondary deity, on achieving at some historical moment mastery over a certain parcel of this earth, exalts himself to a posture of omnipotence, like the Aryan lndra in the following exemplary tale, the moment is at hand for a higher revelation. There had been a period of drought and disaster over all the earth (or so it had seemed) . A prodigious dragon, known as Vritra (the "Encloser") had for a thousand years enveloped and held within itself all the waters of the world's life. Planted fields lay waste. Cities were cities of the dead. Even the capital city of the gods, on the summit of Mount Sumeru, the pivotal



Cos m o logy a n d the My thic Im agi n a ti o n 21
center of the world, was in ruins. Then the vanquisher of demons, lndra, who is above all the Vedic-Aryan gods supreme, flung into the midst of the monstrous coils a thunderbolt that shattered the demon entirely. The wa ters burst free and streamed in ribbons over the land, to circulate once again through the body of the world. That had been a mighty victory. The gods, the saints and sages, learn ing of it, flocked from all directions, their hearts pulsing with joy, to cele brate their champion as in glory he proceeded to the summit of Mount Sumeru. And when, upon arriving, he beheld the devastation, he sum moned Vishvakarman to his side, the architect and craftsman of the Vedic pantheon, commissioning him to reconstruct the city in such a way as would be worthy of such a world savior as himself-which in one year that miraculous builder accomplished. In the center of that godly residence, ra diant with innumerable gems, marvelous with towers, gardens, lakes, and palaces, stood the royal dwelling of the god lndra himself, incomparable in the world, with which, however, he was not even then satisfied. He had ad ditional ideas: more lakes and palaces over there; a different sort of garden here! His vision of glory ever enlarging, he brought Vishvakarman to the point of despair. There was no escape for the craftsman till released by his insatiate employer. Sick at heart, therefore, Vishvakarman turned for protection secretly to Brahma, the universal creator, who abides far beyond and above the his torical sphere of l ndra's temporal victories. Brahma sits enthroned on the radiant lotus of a cosmic dream represented as growing from the navel of the slumbering divinity, Vi�t:J.U (Vishnu) . Metaphorically, that is to say, the universe together with Brahma, its creator, is the emanation of some supe rior god's imagination. Vi�t:J.U is represented couched upon a prodigious seven-headed cobra named Ananta, which means "endless." The serpent floats upon the cosmic Milky Ocean that is the mother of us all. Its bound less energy gives the impulse that provokes the world-dreamer's dream and appears in space-time as the universe, that radiant lotus on which, not only Brahma, but any god may be envisioned enthroned. It is in Vi�t:�-u's dream personified as his iakti, the goddess Padma or Padmavati (Sanskrit, padmii, "lotus") , fakti being a term signifying "power, energy," and specifically, the active energy of a deity, personified as his wife. 14 So when Vishvakarman, in secret prayer, had delivered to Brahma the



22 The In n e r Reaches of O u ter Space
burden of his plea, the lotus-enthroned divinity responded, "0 Blessed One, you shall tomorrow be quit of your task! " and descending from his
lotus-suppon, the god proceeded to Vaikuntha in the nonhern ocean, where Vi�I)U couches upon Ananta, while the divine craftsman, unbur dened, returned in peace to his work.
And indeed, next morning there appeared at the great gate of l ndra's palace, surrounded by a cluster of children infatuated by his beauty, Vi�I) U
himself in the form o fa ten-year-old, blue-black boy attired in a white dhori,
with a bright religious mark painted on his forehead, a parasol in one hand and a pilgrim staff in the other. "0 Poner," he said to the poner at the gate,
"hurry and let your Indra know that a Brahmin has come to see him." Which the poner promptly did. And when Indra then arrived to greet his guest and
beheld that smiling, beautiful child, he gladly invited him in. And having
welcomed him with an offering of honey and milk and fruits, he asked: " 0 Venerable Boy, pray tell m e the purpose of your coming. "
Whereupon that lovely child, with a voice as soft and deep as of a gen
tly thundering cloud replied, "0 King of Gods, I have heard of the won derful city and palace that you are building, and have come to refer to you
a few questions that are in my mind. How many more years do you expect
to spend in this magnificent construction? What further engineering feats
will be requi red of Vishvakarman? 0 G reatest of the Gods, no I ndra be
fore you has ever completed such a residence." Full of the wine of his triumph, the god broke into a loud laugh . " l ndras before me?" he said. "Tell me, Child, how many might those
l ndras or Vishvakarmans be whom you have seen, or of whom you may
have heard?" The brahmin boy laughed as well. "My ch ild," he answered; and his
words, though gen tle, delightful as nectar to the ears, sent through l nd ra,
slowly, a ch ill: " Kashyapa, your father, I knew, the Old Tortoise M an , Lord Progenitor o f AJI Creatures; also, Marichi, your grandfather, a saint
whose only weal th lay in his devotion; likewise, Brah ma, offspring of the
world-navel of Vi�I)u; and Vi�I)U, too , I know, the Preserver of Brah ma.
"0 King of Gods, I have beheld the dreadful dissolution of the uni verse, when everything, every atom, melts into an immense sea, empty
of life. No one can say how many un iverses there may be, or how many cycles of ages in each universe there may ever have been; how many Brahmas,



Cos m o logy and the Mythic Imagi nati o n 23
how many Vi�x:tus, how many Sivas. 0 King of Gods, there are those in your service who hold that it might be possible to number the particles of sand on earth, or drops of rain that fall from the sky, but no one will ever number all the Indras. "The life and kingship of an Indra last, according to the divine stan dard of measure, seven eons; and the period of twenty-eight Indras amounts to one day and night of Brahma. Brahma's length of life is 108 years, according to that standard [108 x 4 = 432] . My Child, not to speak of Indras, of those Brahmas there is no end. Brahma follows Brahma. One sinks, the next arises. Nor can anyone estimate the number of the uni verses, side by side, at any moment of time, each containing a Brahma, a Vi�x:tu and a Siva. Like delicate boats they float upon the fathomless, pure waters of the body of Maha-Vi�t:J.U. And like the pores of the body of that Great Vi�t:J.U, those universes are numberless, each harboring no end of gods such as yourself. " A procession of ants in military formation had made its appearance on the floor of the great hall during the discourse of that beautiful boy, and when he saw them he laughed, but then fell silent and withdrew deeply into himself. Indra's lips, palate, and throat had gone dry. "Young Brahmin, why do you laugh?" he asked. "And who are you, here in the guise of a boy? To me you seem to be the Ocean of Virtue, concealed in deluding mist." The magnificent child resumed. "I laughed because of those ants. The reason is a mystery. Do not ask me to disclose it. The seed of woe, as well as the source of all wisdom, is hidden in this secret. Like an ax it strikes at the root of the tree of wordly vanity; yet to those groping in darkness it is a lamp. Seldom revealed even to saints, buried in the wisdom of the ages, it is the living breath of ascetics, versed in the Vedas, who have renounced and transcended their mortality. But fools deluded by pride and desire it destroys. " The boy sank into silence, smiling, and Indra, unable to move, his lips, palate, and throat parched, presendy asked, humbly: "0 Son of a Brahmin, who you are I do not know. You seem to be Wisdom Incarnate. Disclose to me this secret of the ages, this light that dispels the dark. " Requested thus to teach, Vigm in the guise of a boy opened to the god a hidden wisdom rarely revealed even to yogis. "0 Indra," said he, "those



24 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp a c e
marching ants that we saw i n long parade, passing file b y file, innumerable: each formerly was an Indra. Like you, each by virtue of selfless deeds once rose to the rank of a king of gods, but then, full of pride, self-serving, re turned through many births to the condition of an ant. That was an army of former Indras. "Piety and selfless deeds elevate the inhabitants of this earth to exalted spiritual estates: the condition of a brahmin, a king, an Indra, to the heaven of a Brahma, a Vi�Q.u, or a Siva. But then, self-serving acts reduce them to the realms beneath, of sorrow and pain, rebirths among birds and vermin, or out of the wombs of pigs and beasts of the wild, or among trees. Action is a function of character, which in turn is controlled by custom. This is the whole substance of the secret. This knowledge is the ferry across the ocean of hell to beatitude. "For all the animate and inanimate objects in this world, 0 Indra, are transitory, like dream. The gods on high, the mute trees and stones, are but apparitions in the fantasy. Good and evil attaching to a person are as per ishable as bubbles. In the cycles of time they alternate. The wise are at tached to neither." An old yogi had entered while the beautiful boy was speaking. His head was piled high with matted hair, he wore a black deerskin around his loins, on his forehead a white religious mark was painted, and on his chest was a curious circle of hair, intact at the circumference, but from the cen ter many hairs were gone. Over his head he held a parasol of grass. And coming directly between the king and the boy, he sat down on the floor like a lump of stone. Then the great and glorious Indra, recovering his character as king, bowed to his stern guest, paid obeisance, and having offered him refresh ments, honey and milk and fruits, bade him welcome; whereupon the boy, doing him reverence, began to ask the very questions the king would have proposed. "0 Holy Man," he said, "from where do you come? What is your name? And what brings you to this place? Where is your present home? What is the meaning of the grass parasol over your head? And what is the portent of that circular hairtuft on your chest: why is it dense at the cir cumference, but at the center almost bare? Be kind enough, 0 Holy Man, to answer these, my questions. I am curious to hear."



Cos m o logy a n d the My th ic Im agi n a ti o n 25
Patiently the old saint smiled and slowly began his reply. "0 Young Brahmin, Hairy is my name. I have come here to see Indra. Since I know that my life is to be short, I have decided to possess no house of my own, neither to marry, nor to labor. For the present, begging is my livelihood, and to protect myself from rain and sun, I hold this parasol over my head. But as to this circle of hair on my chest, it is to the children of this world a source of fear, yet productive also of wisdom. With the fall of an Indra, one hair drops out. That is why in the center all the hairs are gone. When the rest of the period allotted to the present Brahma will have expired, I myself shall die. 0 Brahmin Boy, it follows I am short of days. Why there fore a house, a wife, or a son? "When every blink ofthe eyes ofVigm marks the passing of a Brahma, it necessarily follows that everything is as insubstantial as a cloud taking shape and dissolving. I therefore devote myselfexclusively to meditation on the eviternal lotus feet of Vi�I).U. Rest in transcendent Vi�I).U is more than redemption, since every joy, even heavenly bliss, is fragile as a dream and only interferes with concentration on the Supreme. "Siva, the peace-bestowing, highest spiritual guide, taught me this wis dom," said the old man as he vanished. The boy also disappeared. And the king, Indra, sat alone, bewildered and unstrung. 15






CHAPTER I I
M ETAP H O R As MYTH AN D As RE LI G I O N
TH E PROB LEM
From the point of view of any orthodoxy, myth might be defined simply as "other people's religion, " to which an equivalent definition of religion would be " misunderstood mythology," the misunderstanding consisting in the interpretation of mythic metaphors as references to hard fact: the Virgin Birth, for example, as a biological anomaly, or the Promised Land as a portion of the Near East to be claimed and settled by a people chosen of God, the term "God" here to be understood as denoting an actual, though invisible, masculine personality, who created the universe and is now resident in an invisible, though actual, heaven to which the "j ustified" will go when they die, there to be joined at the end of time by their resur rected bodies.
What, in the name of Reason or Truth, is a modern mind to make of such evident nonsense? Like dreams, myths are productions of the human imagination. Their images, consequently-though derived from the material world and its supposed history-are, like dreams, revelations of the deepest hopes, de sires and fears, potentialities and conflicts, of the human will-which in turn is moved by the energies of the organs of the body operating variously
27



28 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp a ce
against each other and in concert. Every myth, that is to say, whether or not by intention, is psychologically symbolic. Its narratives and images are to be read, therefore, not literally, but as metaphors. Mythologies are addressed, however, as dreams normally are not, to questions of the origins, both of the natural world and of the arts, laws, and customs of a local people, physical things being understood in this view as metaphysically grounded in a dreamlike mythological realm beyond space and time, which, since it is physically invisible, can be known only to the mind. And as the insubstantial shapes of dream arise from the formative ground of the individual will, so do all the passing shapes of the physical world arise (according to this way of thought) from a universal, morpho genetic ground that is made known to the mind through the figurations of myth. These mythic figurations are the "ancestral forms," the insubstantial archetypes, of all that is beheld by the eye as physically substantial, mate rial things being understood as ephemeral concretions out of the energies of these noumena. Traditional forms of tools, dwellings, and weapons have their j ustification in such everlasting models. Rituals are direct expositions of their life-sustaining patterns. Temples and the narratives of myth are hermetic fields within which those apparitions known as gods and god desses, demons, angels, demigods, incarnations, and the like typify in the guise of charismatic personalities the locally recognized vortices of con sciousness out of which all aspects of the local theater of life derive their being. The figurations of myth are expressive, therefore, as those of dream normally are not, of a range of universal-as distinguished from specifi cally individual-concerns. In vision the mind may expand to that cosmic range, as in the raptures of shamans and mystics; for the energies shaping the natural world are the same as those that operate through the organs of the human body. However, as noticed in the Chhandogya Upani�ad: "Just as those who do not know the spot might pass, time and again, over a hid den treasure of gold without discovering it, so do all the creatures of this world pass daily into that Brahma-world [in deep sleep] without discover ing it, distracted as they are by false ideas . " 1 The distinguishing first function of a properly read mythology is to re lease the mind from its naive fixation upon such false ideas, which are of material things as things-in-themselves. Hence, the figurations of myth are



Metap h o r A s Myth a n d A s Religio n 29
metaphorical (as dreams normally are not) in two senses simultaneously, as bearing (I) psychological but at the same time (2) metaphysical connota tions. By way of this dual focus the psychologically significant features of any local social order, environment, or supposed history can become trans formed through myth into transparencies revelatory of transcendence. Immanuel Kant has supplied an astonishingly simple formula for the interpretation of such dual statements. It appears in his fundamental Prolegomena zu einerjeden kiinftigen Metaphysik, die als Wissenschaft wird auftreten konnen, paragraphs 57-58. What there is offered is a four-term analogy (a is to b as c is to x) , pointing not to an imperfect resemblance of two things, but to a perfect resemblance of two relationships between quite dissimilar things ( "nicht etwa, eine unvollkommene .ifnlichkeit zweier Dinge, sondern eine vollkommene Ahnlichkeit zweier Verhiiltnisse zwischen ganz uniihnlichen Dingen ") : not " a somewhat resembles b," but "the relation ship of a to b perfectly resembles that of c to x," where x represents a quan tity that is not only unknown but absolutely unknowable-which is to say, is metaphysical. Kant demonstrates the formula in two examples:
(I) As the promotion of the happiness of the children (a) is related to the parents' love ( b) , so is the welfare of the human race (c) to that unknown in God (x) which we call God's love; and (2) The causality of the highest cause (x) is precisely, in respect to the world (c) , what human reason (b) is in respect to the work of human art (a) .
The first of these propositions is of the mythological order, addressed to the heart; the second, philosophical, engaging the head. Kant discusses the implication of the second of the two, as follows: "Herewith the nature of the highest cause itself remains unknown to me; I only compare its known effect (namely, the constitution of the uni verse) and the rationality of this effect with the known effects of human reason, and therefore I call that highest cause a Reason, without thereby at tributing to it as its proper quality, either the thing that I understand by this term in the case of man, or any other thing with which I am familiar. " 2 Indeed, as Kant has also argued, whereas the idea of a cause as prereq uisite to any effect is a rational notion relevant to and confirmed by physical

observations within the temporal field of phenomenal appearances, its ap plication a priori to a supposed relationship between eternity (as First Cause) and temporality (as Created Effect) is but by analogy, and an im precise analogy at that. For temporal effects succeed in time their "efficient" causes, whereas, since there never was a time when time was not, the "mor phogenetic" relationship of eternity to time is not to be thought of as se quential. Moreover, eternity being by definition outside or beyond temporality, transcendent of all categories, whether of virtue or of reason {being and nonbeing, unity and multiplicity, love and justice, forgiveness and wrath) , the term and concept "God" is itself but a metaphor of the un knowing mind, connotative, not only beyond itself, but beyond thought. So that all that can be said of it, whether as touching time or eternity, has to be in the way of an "as if" (als ob}: philosophically and theologically (as Kant has just shown) , through the analogy of a rationally inferred First Cause, and mythologically {as in his earlier example) , in the way of a psy chologically affective image transparent to transcendence. 3 For example, at the opening of the Lord's Prayer ("Our Father, who art in Heaven . . . "), the invocation, "Our Father, " is metaphorical, since the designated subject is not, in fact, a male parent, nor even a human being; yet its import is psychological, since the phrase suggests a relation ship and system of human sentiments such as that of a child to its male par ent, while there is evident, also, a transcendent, or metaphysical, connotation, in that the implied parent is not of this earth, and thus of time and space, but of eternity, in "Heaven," which is our popular term for the morphogenetic field. An equivalent prayer could as well have been addressed to "Our Mother, who art within or beneath the earth." In fact, there have been many religions, and there may yet be many more, for which the preferred "as if," or "make believe," is of the child to its mother; and the sentiments evoked by this spiritual attitude have conduced to the appearances in many parts of the world of customs, arts, and manners of worship very different from those of the metaphorical child of a metaphysical father. In the popular nightmare of history, where local mythic images are in terpreted, not as metaphors, but as facts, there have been ferocious wars waged between the parties of such contrary manners of metaphoric repre sentation. The Bible abounds in examples. And today (1984-85) , in the

formerly charming little city of Beirut, the contending zealots of three dif fering inflections even of the same idea of a single paternal "God" are un loading bombs on each other. One cannot but ask: What can such tribal literalism possibly contribute but agony to such a world of intercultural, global prospects as that of our present century? It all comes of misreading metaphors, taking denotation for connotation, the messenger for the message; overloading the carrier, consequently, with sentimentalized significance and throwing both life and thought thereby off balance. To which the only generally recognized cor rection as yet proposed has been the no less wrongheaded one of dismissing the metaphors as lies (which indeed they are, when so construed) , thus scrapping the whole dictionary of the language of the soul (this is a metaphor) by which mankind has been elevated to interests beyond procre ation, economics, and "the greatest good of the greatest number. " Do I hear, coming as from somewhere that is nowhere, the frightening sound of an Olympian laugh?

Among the most widely known and (formerly) commonly understood symbolic signs inherited from Bronze Age times by the high civilizations of both the Occident and the Orient were the sun and moon: the latter, the moon, which sheds its shadow to be born again, connoting the power of life, as here engaged in the field of time, to throw off death-which is to say, the power of life, as here embodied in each of us, to know itself as tran scendent of carnality; with the sun, the light of which is unshadowed, rec ognized as the light and energy of consciousness disengaged from this field of time, transcendent and eternal. In the context of these symbolic assignments, the cycle of a single lunar month has been compared, by analogy, to the term of a human lifetime, with the fifteenth night, which is of the moon become full, equated with the human adult's thirty-fifth year (in the reckoning of three-score years and ten as the human norm) . 4 On that very special evening there is a mo ment when the rising moon, having just emerged on the horizon, is directly faced across the world, from the opposite horizon, by the setting sun. Certain months ofthe year and the two, at this perfectly balanced moment,



32 Th e In n e r Reaches of O u te r Sp ace
are of equal light and the same size. By analogy, the confrontation has been likened to that in the midmoment of a lifetime when the light of consciousness reflected in the mind may be recognized, either suddenly or gradually, as identical with that typified metaphorically as of the sun. Whereupon , if the witness is prepared, there ensues a transfer of self identification from the temporal, reflecting body to the sunlike, eviternal source, and one then knows oneself as consubstantial with what is of no time or place but universal and beyond death, yet incarnate in all beings everywhere and forever; so that as we again may read in the Upani�ad: tat tvam asi, "thou art that. " 5 This is the realization connoted in the metaphor of the Virgin Birth, when in the mind and heart the ideal is conceived of a life lived, not for the primaty economic and biological ends of survival, progeny, prosperity, and a little fun, but to a metaphysical end, intending values transcendent of historical survival. Teachers, accordingly, whose "kingdom is not of this world" Qohn 18:36) , as well as heroic personages or legendary figures who have given themselves totally to great causes, may be represented in folk memory as of virgin births. The motif is of common occurrence in American Indian lore. In Greek mythology heroes begotten of Zeus are un numbered. Even in the Old Testament there is a modified suggestion of the motif in Sarah's conception of Isaac at the age of ninety (Genesis 17: 16-19, 18:9-15, 21:1-2) ; and again a suggestion hardly disguised in the chapter of the birth of Samson Qudges 13) . During the first five Christian centuries the question remained un settled as to whether Mary had conceived literally of God or had normally given birth to a son who then had become endowed by God when, on being baptized in the Jordan, "he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descend ing upon him like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, 'Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased' " (Mark 1: 11) . It was only in the year A.D. 431, at the church council held in Ephesus (which at that time was the greatest temple-city in the Near East of the Great Goddess of Many Names: Artemis, Ishtar, Astarte, Anahit, Aphrodite, Isis, and so on) that the earthly mother, Mary, of the historical Jesus was authoritatively declared to have been literally Theotokos ("God-bearer, " "mother of God") . The bishop Nestorius of Constantinople refused to accept this reifica tion of the metaphor and was exiled to die in an Egyptian desert. However,



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 33
a significant number of Christian communities (chiefly ofAsia Minor and Syria) also refused and, emigrating to Persia, there established the seat of a "Nestorian" tradition, which by the end of the tenth century had become the representative Christianity of Central and East Asia, along the caravan routes and into China. In those parts of the Orient the well-known mythic metaphor of the Virgin Birth was not in this instance miraculized as a physical fact. The historical fact of the Crucifixion, on the other hand, has been throughout the Christian centuries miraculized as the medium of "Salvation," with this latter term subject to a variery of interpretations. The founding myth has been, of course, that of Man's Fall by the Tree in the Garden (Genesis 3) and Salvation by virtue of the sacrifice of the God-Man Christ Jesus on the Tree of the Cross (Matthew 27:33-54; Mark 15:22-39; Luke 23 :33-49; John 19: I7-30) , whereby a mythological Fall has become historicized as a prehistoric fact of c. 4004 or 3760 B.C. , and a historical cru cifixion, c. A.D. 30, mythologized as reparation for that Fall. The result has been a blend of history and mystery of such compelling fascination that both the psychological and the metaphysical connotations of the metaphoric symbols have been all but lost in the pathos of the screen. Dispassionately analyzed, however, by way of comparative-mythological equations, the narrative opens readily to its archetypal revelation. For the biblical mythologem of The Fall is but a variant of the universally known Separation ofHeaven and Earth, where the consciousness of an intelligible "Presence" informing all the transformations of the temporal shapes of the world is represented as having been in some way, at some moment, lost, with the mind and spirit of mankind then trapped in phenomenality alone. While the metaphor of Salvation, Redemption, or At-one-ment, is connotative simply of a restoration to the deluded mind of its original intuition of an identification of the features of time with eter nal life; as appears, for example, in the words of Christ reported in the re cently discovered Gnostic Gospel According to Thomas: "Cleave a piece of wood, I am there; lift up the stone and you will find me there" (Logion 77:26-27) . 6 Or again: "The Kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it" (Logion npy) . 7 The relevant Sanskrit terms are, respectively, miiyii, the formative power of delusion, and bodhi, illu mination .



34 Th e In n e r Reaches of O u te r Sp ace
The Old Testament motif of the Promised Land, interpreted compara tively in this way, relieved of its ethnic associations and so revealed as a local variant of a mythological archetype known from many parts of the world, takes on a meaning very different from that of a divine mandate to conquer and occupy by military force an already populated area of the Near East. The very much later medieval idea of the Earthly Paradise is a variant of the same theme, representing a spiritual region, or condition of mind, wherein phenomenal forms are recognized as revelatory of transcen dence. The Navaho of the North American Southwest identify every fea ture of the magnificent desert in which they dwell with an equivalent feature of their mythology: the coyotes, the various mountains, water courses, frogs, serpents, rainbows, spiders, red ants, dragonflies, and so on-so that wherever they go and whatever they see, they are in mind of supporting powers. Likewise the Norse, who in the ninth century A.D. settled uninhabited Iceland, mythologized the raw landscape. Land ntim ("land claiming or taking") was their technical term for this way of sancti fying a region, converting it thereby into an at once psychologically and metaphysically symbolic Holy Land. 8 And the Vedic Aryans on entering India, thirteenth century or so B.C., performed the same work upon the landscapes of the Indus Valley and Gangetic Plain. 9 "The Kingdom of the Father," we have j ust heard, "is spread upon the earth and men do not see it." Land ndm, mythologization, has been the universally practiced method to bring this intelligible kingdom to view in the mind's eye. The Promised Land, therefore, is any landscape recognized as mythologically transparent, and the method of acquisition of such a territory is not by prosaic physical action, but poetically, by intelligence and the method of art; so that the human being should be dwelling in the two worlds simultaneously of the illuminated moon and the illuminating sun. The festival of Easter, accordingly, is scheduled to coincide annually with the weekend of the first full moon following the solar spring equinox, thus calling to mind the old Bronze Age symbolic metaphor of its fifteenth night, when the moon, fully illuminated, is self-equaled to the sun. Jesus Christ, according to his legend, was about thirty-five years of age at the time of his crucifixion, as was also Guatama Buddha when he sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. The three metaphors are equivalent as alternative signs of the high mystical experience of an absorption of mortal appearance in

immortal being; for which another historical figure of speech is the "End of the World. "

I n the normal course o f a well-favored human lifetime the unfolding o f the body's vital energy transpires through marked stages of transformation which in the pictographic lexicon of India's yogic schools are represented as controlled from separate spinal centers known as cakras (pronounced "chakras," meaning "circles, wheels") , also as padmiis ("lotuses") . These are pictured and experienced as ranged in ascending order along an invisible spinal nerve or channel called sushumna ("supremely blessed, rich in hap piness") 10 (see Figure 3) . The first and lowest of the series, described as situated between the anus and genitalia, is known as muladhara ("root base") and identified as the motivating center of that simple, primal hold ing to life which is of infancy and early childhood. The body's urgency at this stage is to feeding and assimilating, which, as noticed in our introduc tion, is the precondition of all animal life, which can exist only by con suming lives. The second bioenergetic station, svadhish{hana (energy's "own, or especial, standing place") , is of sexuality, awakened during ado lescence. And the third, known as matJipura ("city of the shining jewel") , at the level of the navel, is then of the will to power, mastery, and control, which in its healthy, positive aspect is of power achieved, with a sense of pride in responsibility; but in its morbid, negative form it appears as an in satiable will to conquer, plunder, and subjugate, converting everything and everybody within reach into one's own or one's like. In the normal course of a lifetime, according to this yogic psychologi cal schedule, the biological urges generated from these three pelvic spinal centers mature naturally in succession as the body develops through it first three and a half decades. These, and these alone, have supplied the moti vations of historical man, his effective moral systems, and his nightmare of world history. They are the centers of the basic urges, furthermore, that mankind shares with the beasts-namely (1) to survive alive by feeding on other lives, (2) to generate offspring, and (3) to conquer and subdue. Unrestrained by any control system, these become devastating, as the his tory of the present century surely tells. For as declared in the Indian Artha



36 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Sp ace
Sastra, "Textbook on the Art of Winning": "When uncontrolled by virtue (dharma) and the big stick (da1Jtfa) , men become wolves unto men." The elevation of the human will to aims transcendent of this bestial order of life requires, according to the yogic model, an awakening that will not be of the pelvic region, but of cakra 4, which is of the heart. The name of this transformative center, aniihata, has the curious meaning "not hit," which is interpreted as signifying "the Sound that is not made by any two things striking together. " For every sound heard by the physical ear is of things rubbing or striking together. That of the voice, for example, is of breath on the vocal cords. The one sound not so made is the great tone, or hum (Jabda) , of the creative energy (miiyii, sakti) of which things are the manifestations, or epiphanies. And the intuitive recognition of this creative tone within a phenomenal form is what opens the heart to love. What before had been an "it" becomes then a "thou, " alive with the tone of creation.
Figure 3· Figure seared in the yogic Lotus Position (padmasana), illustrating the distribu tion of subtle Lotus Centers (padmas, or cakras) along the subtle spinal nerve or channel known as sushumnii. Two interlacing lateral nerves, irja (here dark) and pingalii (light) , carry the viral breaths of the left, respectively, and right nostrils to the lowest center, where they may be brought to enter the sushumnii. Each Lotus resounds to a special syllable and is endowed with symbolic features: I. muliidhiira (situated between the anus and genitals), of the element Earth, having four crim son petals and a yellow, rectangular interior bearing the sign of the syllable lam; 2. sviidhishtiJna (region of the genitals) , of the element Water, with six vermilion petals and a white interior containing a crescent moon and the sign of the syllable vam; 3· ma1}ipura (region of the navel) , o f the element Fire, with ten smoky-purple petals and a fiery triangle within, resounding to the syllable ram. These lowest three are centers of basic physical energies and urges. 4· aniihata (region of the heart) , of the element Air (breath, spiritus, prii7Ja), having twelve red petals and an interior showing a six-pointed star composed of two opposed tri angles, one downward, the other upward turned, within which a golden lingam-yoni sym bol connoting a subtle spiritual rapture resounds to the syllable yam. Just below this Lotus of spiritual birth there is a minor center with eight petals, as a vestibule of meditation upon one's "chosen guardian deiry" (ishta-devatii). There the



Metap h o r As Myth a n d As Religi o n 37
"Wish-fulfilling Tree" (kalpataru) is found, set upon a jewelled altar (matzipitha). The uppermost three centers are of increasingly sublimated spiritual realizations: 5· viiuddha (region of the larynx) , of the element Space (akiisa, often translated "ether") , hav ing sixteen smoky-purple petals (same color as 3) , a white triangle within (at 3 it was red, here clarified) , and resounding to the syllable ham. This is the center of spiritual effort, lead ing to 6. ajiia (at the forehead, between and above the eyes: compare in Figure 1 the place of the jinas, the "Victors") . The Lotus here is of two petals, white and radiant as the moon, supporting a supreme vision of the Goddess, or of a God-with-Form, from which the tone is to be heard sounding of the syllable OM; beyond which there is, finally 7· the Lotus of a Thousand Petals, sahasrara, inverted over the whole crown of the head, representing a rap ture beyond any god known as of a name or form.



38 The Inner Reaches of Outer Space
This is the way of seeing things that is of mythology and of what in chapter 3 is discussed as "The Way of Art": an awakening (metaphorically) to a New World (the Promised Land) and to Life in the Spirit (the Virgin Birth) . In the way of nature one may experience, from time to time, glimpses of the world in this light-after the pelvic bioenergetic commit ments have been honored and fulfilled, so that, freed from the dictatorship of the species, one is released to live as an individual (some little time, say, after the age of about thirty-five) . The disciplines of yoga and devotional religion are meant to facilitate and ensure attainment of this revelation. However, as every chronicle of war and peace unquestionably demon strates, it has simply not been within the power of our historical religions to open the hearts of congregations beyond their own recognized horizons: which at this historic moment is unfortunate, since (to repeat the argument of our introduction) with the populations of the planet now on the point of becoming one, there are in fact no more horizons beyond which to proj ect upon aliens the malice of God's unsublimated product, historical man. Apparently, the words of Christ, "But I say to you, Love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44) , have today to be taken seriously, even by monotheists. The transformation of character that is prerequisite for living in the light of a transformed world is symbolized in the imagery of the yogic lotus ladder by a final triad of cakra.r-numbers 5, 6, and 7-which are of the head and mind pursuing aims and ends beyond range of the physical senses. The first of these, viiuddha ("cleansed, clarified, perfectly pure") , is pictured at the level of the larynx (the seat of abstract speech) , and the work to be accomplished there is a clarification of the senses, to the end of Blake's already quoted dictum: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite." The required method to this end is known as the turning about ofthe energy, which is to say, simply, an application of all the available malice and aggression of cakra 3, not outward to the correction of the world, but inward, upon oneself; as in Jesus' thought: not removing the mote from one's brother's eye, but casting out the beam from one's own (Matthew 7:3-5, abridged) . The Indian pictorial metaphor is of a wrathful deity in demonic form, wearing necklaces of severed heads, kilts of severed arms and legs, flour ishing weapons and trampling down human shapes underfoot. This demon is a manifestation of one's own impulse to aggression turned back



Metap h o r As Myth a n d As Religio n 39
on oneself, the vanquished shapes underfoot representing attachment to physical desires and the fear of physical death. The next and last two stages of the ascending lotus series are then of the two ways of experiencing what is known as "God," either as "with form" or as "without." The lotus at cakra 6, known as ii}fiii ("authority, order, unlimited power, command") , is situated within the head, above, behind, and between the eyes. There it is that the radiant image of one's idea of "God" is beheld, while at cakra 7, sahasriira (the lotus, "thousand petaled")-which is represented as an inverted corolla covering the crown of the head, "bright with the brightness of ten million suns"-both the be held image and the beholding mind dissolve together in a blaze that is at once of nonbeing and of being. In a sermon entitled "Riddance," the great Dominican mystic, Meister Eckhart (c. 1260-1328) , declared; "Man's last and highest leave-taking is leaving God for God. " II And the Indian saint Ramakrishna (1836-1886) is reported to have remarked, "At the break of day He disappears into the se cret chamber of His House. " 12 Dante (1265-1321) , in the culminating canto of his poetical account of his own spiritual ascent in vision up the metaphorical scale, from Hell, through Purgatory and the ranges of Heaven, to the Beatific Vision beheld in a blaze of eternal light, declares that there, within the profound subsistence of that light, there appeared, besides the triune image of his God, three circles of three colors and one magnitude. And "I wished to see," he states, "how the image conformed to the circle and how it has its place therein; but my own wings were not suf ficient for that, save that my mind was smitten by a flash wherein its wish came to it." 13 There is a Hindu tantric saying, niidevo devam arcayet, "by none but a god shall a god be worshiped. " The deity of one's worship is a function of one's own state of mind. But it also is a product of one's culture. Catholic nuns do not have visions of the Buddha, nor do Buddhist nuns have vi sions of Christ. Ineluctably, the image of any god beheld-whether inter preted as beheld in heaven or as beheld at cakra 6-will be of a local ethnic idea historically conditioned, a metaphor, therefore, and thus to be recog nized as transparent to transcendence. Remaining fixed to its name and form, whether with simple faith or in saintly vision, is therefore to remain in mind historically bound and attached to an appearance.



40 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp ace
In the vocabulary of yoga, the two modes of realization, at cakra 6 and cakra 7, are termed, respectively, sagu?Ja brahman (the "qualified absolute"} and nirgu?Ja brahman (the "unqualified absolute") , while the two related orders of meditation are, respectively, savikalpa samiidhi ("discriminating absorption") and nirvikalpa samiidhi ("undifferentiated absorption") . "But this," said Ramakrishna in discussion of the latter, "is an extremely diffi cult path. To one who follows it even the divine play in the world becomes like a dream and appears unreal; his 'I' also vanishes. The followers of this path do not accept the Divine Incarnation. It is a very difficult path. The lovers of God should not hear much of such reasoning. " 14
TH RES H O L D FIGU RES
Thus a t the threshold of the passage from time t o eternity, which i s in fact the plane of reference of the metaphors of myth, the unmitigated yogic way (according to Ramakrishna) is to lose oneself, together with the world, in transcendence, following to the end the metaphysical connotations of the icons of devotion, disengaging altogether from their psychological hold, to the loss of the psyche itself; whereas the more temperate, properly devo tional way is to hold in faithful love to the icons. For, as threshold figures, these are of the two worlds at once: temporal in the human appeal of their pictured denotations, while by connotation opening to eternity. "Once upon a time," said Ramakrishna one evening to his friends, "a sannyari [mendicant monk] entered the temple ofJagganath. As he looked at the holy image he debated within himself whether God had a form or was formless. He passed his staff from left to right to feel whether it touched the image. The staff touched nothing. He understood that there was no image before him; he concluded that God was formless. Next he passed the staff from right to left. It touched the image. The sannyari un derstood that God had form. Thus he realized that God has form and, again, is formless. " 15 "Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute," Ramakrishna con tinued, "is like a shoreless ocean. In the ocean visible blocks of ice are formed here and there by intense cold. Similarly, under the cooling influ ence, so to speak, of the devotion [bhakti] of its worshipers, the Infinite transforms Itself into the finite and appears before the worshiper as God



Me tap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 41
with form. That is to say, God reveals Himself to His devotees as an em bodied Person. Again, as, on the rising of the sun, the ice in the ocean melts away, so, on .the awakening of Knowledge {jfiiina], the embodied God melts back into the infinite and formless Brahman. . . . Therefore people compare the love of God to the cooling light of the moon, and knowledge to the burning rays of the sun." 16 In terms of the ascent of the yogic lotus ladder, the ultimate aim of any worshiper of a God with form must be to come to rest forever (as at cakra 6) in an eviternal heaven, "tasting the ambrosial j uice" of bliss in the pres ence of the worshiped form; whereas a fully aspiring mystic will be making every effort to pass through and beyond that moonlike reflecting image to extinction (at cakra 7) in the full light of the sun. "In that state, " said Ramakrishna, "reasoning stops altogether and man becomes mute. . . . A salt doll once went to measure the depths of the ocean. . . . No sooner did it get into the ocean than it melted. Now who was there to report the ocean's depth?" 17 There is, however, a third position, typified in the Mahayana Buddhist ideal of the Bodhisattva, whose "being or nature" (sattva) is "enlightenment" (bodhi), and who yet with unquenched "compassion" (karuflii} for his or her fellow creatures has either remained in or returned to this suffering world, to teach. Such a one was Ramakrishna himself. Such a one is the Dalai Lama. An equivalent understanding is to be recognized in the figure of Christ Crucified, "who," as we read in St. Paul to the Philippians, "though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped [or clung to 18] , but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled him self and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross." In Albrecht DUrer's woodcuts of scenes of the Crucifixion (see Figure 4) , disks of the sun and moon appear in the upper left and right corners. Likewise, in the upper left and right corners of Tibetan processional ban ners representing Bodhisattvas, disks of the sun and moon may appear, for the same reason. These are explicit references to that moment, already noted (see page 31) , of the moon rising full on its fifteenth night, con fronting with equal radiance the sun setting at that moment on the oppo site horizon: the moon not quenched in solar light, but, fully illuminated, self-equaling.

For these are threshold forms at the interface of time and eternity. Read in one direction, they symbolize the passage of the light of con sciousness from engagement in the field of birth and death (the lunar body, which dies) to identification with an immortal source, "which neither is born, nor does it ever die; nor, having once been will it cease to be. Unborn, eternal, perpetual and primeval, it is not slain when the body is slain" (Bhagavad Gita 2:20) . Whereas, read in the opposite sense, the fig ures represent (as in the passage quoted from Paul to the Philippians) the willing participation in the sorrows of space-time of one who, though in the knowledge of himself as of the nature of immortal bliss, yet voluntar ily, as an avatar (Sanskrit, avatiira, from ava-, "down," plus tarati, "he passes across or over") joyfully engages in the fragmentation of life in Time. There is a form of the crucifix known as "Christ Triumphant," where the figure of the Savior is shown not broken, bleeding, naked, and with head dropped to the side, but with head erect, eyes open, body clothed, and arms outstretched as though willingly "thus come" (tathagata), as the very image of a Bodhisattva in whom the agony of time and the rapture of eter nity are disclosed as one and the same. Sun and moon in the practiced disciplines of the yoga of expanding consciousness are associated psychophysiologically with two subtle nerves, or channels, of "vital energy" (prar:zik), known as narj'is, "stems or tubes," which are related to the breathing and breaths of the right, respectively, and left nostrils. These descend along the central spinal cord to right and to left of the sushumnii, ending with it together at the muliidhara, cakra 1, which is accordingly known as Yuktatriver:zi, "Three River Junction," this being an allegorical reference, in the way of a geographical land ndm iden tification, to the mythological junction at Allahabad of the Jumna, Ganges, and (to mortal eyes invisible river) Sarasvati. 19 The right nerve, known as pingala ("tawny, reddish brown") , is red (in Figure 3, unshaded) . The breath that it carries from the right nostril to the muladhara is of solar energy-"masculine," fiery, poisonous, and deadly; for the sun, as Ramakrishna has told, is of consciousness absolute and eter nal, disengaged from space-time and temporal life. It is a blaze of sheer spirit, whose full force is more than corporeal life can stand. In contrast,



44 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
the left nerve, known as irja ("refreshment, poured libation, revivifying draft") , is pale yellowish or white (shaded in Figure 3), and the breath that it carries from the left nostril down to the multidhiira is of lunar energy, as sociated with moisture, "feminine," cooling and refreshing as dew. The moon, ever dying and self-renewed, is symbolic of consciousness incarnate in all living beings, suffering in each the pains of desire for the passing gratifications of temporal life, subject in each to death, and yet through death's progeny renewed. It is thus the celestial sign of the necessity of sac rifice; for with each giving of itself to death, lunar life (as distinguished from the term of a single lunation) is sustained. Life temporal and eternal, attachment to the world and disengagement from the world: as usually regarded, these are opposed terms. In the im agery of moon and sun, however, the two are brought together, since the light of the moon is but solar light reflected. Likewise, by analogy, our body's life is eternal life, reflected, and our body's consciousness, eternal consciousness, only modified by the limitations of our mind's logical man ner of dualistic thinking. Break those limitations (so runs the argument of yoga) and the mind regains possession of Original Knowledge: the salt doll walks into the ocean. The practical method employed to the achievement of this end is in deed strange. It is known as prii�Jiiyiima, "disciplined control (yiima) of the breath (prii1Ja; Latin, spiritus). " But the sense of it becomes obvious, once the assignments are recognized of mortality and immortality to the breaths of the left, respectively, and right nostrils. The yogi, seated in the "lotus position" (padmiisana), legs crossed, spine erect, eyes focused to a plane at about the distance to the point of the nose (not to be distracted by anything beyond that plane) , begins by inhaling, first, through the right nostril, imagining solar energy as thus being brought into the " fiery" nerve, piizgalti, down to the multidhiira. Holding the lungs full for a determined time, experiencing solar energy as pervading the whole body, the yogi then exhales through the left nostril , thus bringing breath of the lunar aspect u p through irfa and out into the world. The next inhalation will be through the left nostril, down through irfa to the multidhiira; holding; and exhaling then through piizgalti; and so on and on.

This continuing through hours without end for days, for months, or for years, at some point the body and mind together become funda mentally aware and convinced that the energy by which the body is per vaded is the same as that which illuminates the world and maintains alive all beings, the two breaths being the same: which is the moment of an awakening of the body itself to its inherent spirituality and the begin ning of the ascent of priifla up the central nerve or channel, the sushumnii. 20 Ramakrishna has described the actual sensation of the ris ing current: "Sometimes the Spiritual Current rises through the spine, crawling like an ant. Sometimes, in samiidhi, the soul swims joyfully in the ocean of di vine ecstasy, like a fish. Sometimes, when I lie down on my side, I feel the Spiritual Current pushing me like a monkey and playing with me joyfully. I remain still. That Current, like a monkey, suddenly with one jump reaches the sahasriira. That is why you see me j ump with a start. Sometimes, again, the Spiritual Current rises like a bird hopping from one branch to another. The place where it rests feels like fire. . . . Sometimes the Spiritual Current moves up like a snake. Going in a zigzag way, at last it reaches the head and I go into samiidhi. A man's spiritual consciousness is not awakened unless his kufi.r/alini is aroused." 21 Kuflrfalini (kuflrfalin, "circular, annulate, coiled"; kuflrfalini, a femi nine noun meaning "serpent") : kuflrfalini is essential spiritual energy pic tured as a coiled white serpent asleep in the muliidhiira of each of us. Serpents shed their skins, as the moon its shadow, to be as it were reborn. Symbolically, therefore, they are terrestrial counterparts, by analogy, of the heavenly moon, connoting, like the moon, the light of immortal con sciousness engaged, even trapped, in the field of space-time. The continu ous flashing of their fiery forked tongues testifies to the trapped light within them. Hence, the uncoiling "Serpent Power, " kuflrfalinl, ascending the sushumnii to unite at the crown of our head with the lotus "Thousand Petaled, " sahasriira, "bright with the brightness of ten million suns," is equivalent-again by analogy-to the moon approaching its fifteenth night, when its light will match that of the sun. Kuflr/alini and sahasriira therewith unite as one: which is to say (to change the metaphor) , a salt doll once walked into the ocean.

That extreme psychophysiological exercises of this highly sophisti cated and effective, spiritually transformative degree have been practiced in India for at least four thousand years, we know from the evidence of a number of engraved stamp seals from the period of the Indus Valley Civilization, c. 2000 B.C. , featuring figures seated in a classic yoga pos ture known as mulabandhiisana, which is still in practice (see Figures 5 and 6) . The serpents rising at either hand of one of these seated figures strongly suggest the two lateral channels, irf,a and pingalii, with the yogi in the place of the sushumnii. The figure on the other seal here illustrated is distinctly a divinity of a type suggesting Siva, who in Hindu thought is the principal god associated with yoga. In the j ustly celebrated, mag nificent image of Siva the Great Lord in the cave temple of Elephanta, Bombay (eighth century A.D.) , the god is represented with three faces: proper right, a male profile (compare pingala); proper left, a female pro file (it/ii}; and in the center a glorious countenance, full face, reflecting eternity (sushumnii). The tiny Indus Valley image has also (apparently) three faces. Moreover, the prime symbol of Siva is the lingam (erect phallus) , symbolic of his creative energy ever pouring into the cosmic womb (yoni) of the world-mother, Maya-Sakti-Devi, while his emblem atic weapon is the trident (trisula), which is already suggested in the meditating triune god's extraordinary headdress. Finally, the little figure is surrounded by four animals (possibly of the four directions) , a tiger, an elephant, a rhinoceros, and a water buffalo . One cannot but think of representations in European medieval art of Christ of the Second Coming, surrounded by four figures symbolizing the evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-namely, a man, a lion, a bull, and an eagle, which are actually the four zodiacal signs of the solstices and equinoxes of the calendar of the Taurian age, c. 2000 B.C. , respectively, the Water Bearer of the winter solstice of that time, Lion of the summer solstice, Bull of the spring equinox, and Eagle (later, Scorpion) of the autumnal equinox. These are the same four that appear combined in the chimeric forms of those great Assyrian gate-guarding cherubim from the palace at Nimrud of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883-859 B.c. ) , which are compounded of the head of a man, wings of an eagle, body of a bull, and feet of a lion (see Figure 7) .

So com bined, these four brought together in one symbolic form the quarters of that whole revolv ing screen of rhe sky, beyond and behind which the god Ashur resided-as Ashurnasirpal, his vicar on earth, beyond and behind the wall and portal protected by rhis Taurian cherub. In the prophet Ezekiel's vision, late sixth century B . C . , the same four beasts were seen in the faces of the "creatures " before God's throne (Ezekiel r : 5-n; also 10:9-14) , and in Christian iconography, they again appear as signs of the Evangelists.

Additional thoughts which come to mind are of Dante's representation
of Satan in the Inferno (Canto XXXIV, lines 28-69) with three faces: "one in front," we r�ad, "and it was red, and the other two joined to this just over the middle of each shoulder, and all were joined at the crown. The right one seemed between white and yellow, and the left one was such in appearance as are those who come from whence the Nile descends." 22 Red, black,
and pale yellow, the faces represented for Dante Impotence, Ignorance, and Hate, respectively, as direct negatives of the attributes of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which are namely, Power, Wisdom, and Love (see Canto III, lines 5-6) . Compare with this, Ramakrishna's attribution to the Absolute of "Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss": sac-cid-iinanda brahman (see page 40) . I think, also, in this connection of Calvary's three crosses: one, of the crucified thief who would ascend to heaven (Luke 23:39-43) , the other, of him who would descend to hell; and the cross between, of the Savior. Of relevance, too, is the persistent ophitic tradition (Greek ophis, "ser pent") of Christ in the image of a serpent: not only in illustration of the Savior's words to Nicodemus the Pharisee, likening himself to the serpent of bronze elevated by Moses in the wilderness (Numbers 21: 5-9) , but also in the Gnostic sense of an association of the messenger of salvation with the idea of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, who according to this way of inverting the orthodox interpretation, had been the first to attempt to release mankind from bondage to an unknowing god who had identified himself with the Absolute and thus blocked the way to the tree of eternal life. (See Figure 8.) In Buddhist temple art, and indeed in temple art generally, the en trances to sacred precincts are represented as attended by two gate, or threshold, guardians (dvariipiila), which are frequently of threatening miden, with lifted weapons and blazing eyes, one with his mouth open, the other with his mouth shut (see Figure 9) . These are counterparts of the cherubim that Yahweh placed "at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life" (Genesis 3:22-24) . (See again Figure 7.) In the Navaho sand painting re produced in Figure 15 (on page 71) , the same two are termed "Spirit Bringers" (ethkaynadshi}, where they stand as openers of the way into and through a sacred area that in structure and sense corresponds remarkably to what we are told of the stages of the sushumnii.

Text: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness [Numbers 21 : 5-91] . so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoever believes in him may have eternal life" (John 3 =1 5).
In Tantric thought these figures are to be understood as located in the muliidhiira, standing as personifications of the lunar and solar breaths at ei ther side of the gate of the sushumnii, at the openings, respectively, of the it/4 and pingala nerves. For it is there, as we recall, at Yuktatrive7Ji, "The Meeting Place of Three Rivers," that the differentiated lunar and solar energies at last blend to a single fire, which then, like a blast, ascends with the awakened ku1Jt/.aliniinto and along the central way. Until this fusion of the two breaths occurs, the central ponal remains closed. The embodied Lunar consciousness of the practicing individual must first, that is to say, be experienced as in fact the same as the universal sokzrconsciousness by which all beings are energized and given light. Otherwise the mind will either remain locked in materiality, imagining the body and its experience to be of matter alone, or fly rapt away on some supernatural fancy, as though (the universe being of matter alone) soul or spirit should be sought somewhere else.

A simple Buddhist interpretation of the two threatening figures at the portal to immortality would be as representing, not the obstructing will of an external god, but the inhibiting attachment of the human will itself to physi cal mortality in obsessive fear of physical death. For in this view immortality is already ours. Only the mind's attachment to mortal aims has deprived us of this knowledge. Physical desire and fear (the two temptations overcome by Prince Gautama Shakyamuni on the night of his attainment of Buddhahood) are all that are debarring us from the Garden in which, ironi cally, we already dwell; for in this tradition there never was an Exile, only a mistaken focus of mind; as Jesus also is reported to have declared (in the re cently discovered and translated Gnostic Gospel ofThomas) : "The Kingdom is within you" (Logion 3), and again, "The Kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it" (Logion 113) . 23 And so, indeed, it does appear that anyone viewing with unprej udiced eye the religions of mankind must recognize mythic themes at every hand that are shared, though differently interpreted, among the peoples of this planet. James G. Frazer, in The Golden Bough, thought to explain such cor respondences simply as "the effect of similar causes acting alike on the simi lar constitution of the human mind in different countries and under different skies. " 24 Bastian, as we have seen, characterized them as "ele mentary ideas," and C. G. Jung, as we have also remarked, proposed his theory of "archetypes of the unconscious." There are, however, instances that cannot be so readily interpreted in purely psychological terms, where, as for example in the matter of our pres ent interest, a structured constellation of ideas, images, and related exer cises yielding transformational experiences will have appeared over an extensive historical field, here and there in damaged condition perhaps, or creatively modified, yet unmistakably of one originating structure. For it is evident that knowledge of what is known today in India as the ku�r/alini was not in ancient times confined to the Indus Valley Civilization. From nearby Mesopotamia of the same date, c. 2000 B.C. , there is an ornamented Sumerian ritual vessel, known as the Libation Vase of King Gudea of Lagash, upon which, in high relief, the mystery scene appears of two cherubim, or Lion Birds, attending the portal of a shrine to the great Mesopotamian serpent-god Ningishzida under the as pect of a pair of copulating vipers (see Figure 10). They are entwined

about a n axial rod i n such a way a s t o suggest both the caduceus of clas sical Hermes (guide of souls to the knowledge of eternal life) and the seven spinal centers of the sushumna. There is from Egypt, somewhat later, 1405-1367 B.C. (nineteenth dynasty) , from a Theban copy of the Book ofthe Dead, an exceptional representation of the standard Egyptian j udgment scene of the weighing of the heart of the deceased against a feather, where the pole is marked by seven distinct nodules below the balance beam and an eighth above it (see Figure n) . The nose of Osiris's monstrous watchdog, the Swallower (a mixture of crocodile, hippopota mus, and lion, who is to swallow the soul if the heart is heavier than the feather) , cuts directly across the pole between its third and fourth nod ules (read, third and fourth cakras) , which, furthermore, is exactly the level of a platform, across the way, supporting a seated baboon (the ani mal symbolic of Thoth, Egyptian counterpart of the Greek Hermes) . In terms of the ku�r/alini the message could hardly be clearer; namely, if the aims of the deceased in life were no higher than those of cakra 3, the Swallower claims the soul; whereas, if the "sound not made by any two things striking together" had been heard (at cakra 4) and heeded in the lifetime, Thoth will conduct the blessed soul (light as a feather) to Osiris's throne by the Waters of Eternal Life. 25 There is in the Musee Guimet, in Paris, from China of the Chou dy nasty, c. 1027-256 B.c. , a coiled bronze serpent {see Figure 12) showing j ust three and one-half turns, which, to me at least, vety strongly suggests the ku�Jr/alini in the muliidhara. 26 And at the opposite margin of the vast Eurasian common-culture field, in Ireland, ninth centuty A.D. , not only were the enigmatic illuminations of the Book of Kells made alive with sym bolic serpents (most remarkably, the so-called Tunc-page, illustrating Matthew 27:38: tunc cruci.fixerant cum eo duos latrones, "then there were cru cified with him two thieves") , but also, on the side of an immense stone cross of the same pre-Gothic Christian period-the "Cross of [the Abbot] Muiredach," at Monasterboice (in Louth)-there was engraved in high re lief an astonishing panel (see Figure 13) known as Dextra Dei, the "Right Hand of God," in which two interlacing serpents appear, one heading downward, the other upward, enframing three human heads in ascending series, with a human right hand above, reaching to the center of a crown ing, halolike, ornamented disk. 27 If this is not an explicit reference to the top four states of an ascent of the sushumna, the sense of such an appearance

connotations may underlie much, i f not all, of the recondite Irish-monastic symbolic art of that formerly Druidic province of the Christian mission. The Irish abbots were still reading and translating Greek when the learning of the rest of Europe had been obliterated by the Goths, Vandals, Anglo Saxons, and other pagan barbarians of the period of Rome's collapse. Certain peculiarities of their liturgies derived from a once universal Greek rite. And among the anchorites of the period, of whom apparently there were many, such extreme austerities were practiced as in later days were to be hardly known outside of Tibet; as, for example, that of "enclosure, " retirement to a small stone cell "so low and narrow that a tall man could not lie full length," to remain there for life. 28 There can be no question that all the conditions were there present for an understanding both through learn ing and through experience of the spiritual connotations of the metaphors of the Christian faith, such as appears to have been lost to the rest of Europe (and finally to Ireland as well) during the centuries, first of pagan and then of ecclesiastical violence that followed upon the collapse of the already Christianized Roman Empire. All of which suggests a number of possibly unanswerable questions relevant to the formation and manner of dispersal of such a distinct con stellation of symbolic motifs as that which in India has been linked for the past four thousand years to the practice and actual experiences of yoga. For it is evident, even from the brief series of examples that I have just now cited, that the temporal and geographical range of recognition of cer tain of the structuring elements of this distinct constellation is enormous. The earliest evidences-from the valleys of the Indus, Tigris-Euphrates, and Nile-point back to a period antecedent to the entry on the historical stage of the patriarchal Semitic and Indo-European warrior tribes. That Egyptian feather against which the heart of the deceased was to be weighed was an ostrich feather symbolic of the goddess Maat, as a personification of the cosmic order and its natural laws, to which both the social order and the order of an individual lifetime were required to conform-in contrast to the later, Zoroastrian-Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Marxist notion of nature as either "fallen" or indifferent and of society (the interests of the local cul tural monad) as the ultimate determinant of and criterion for what is right and what wrong. The Indian idea of dharma (virtue in the performance of duty) and Chinese of the tao (the unitary first principle from which all



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 59
order, change, and propriety in action spring) are alike derived from the same prehistoric background as the ancient Egyptian idea of the goddess Maat. And the structuring realization out of which these equivalent ideas arose was of a society and its members as equally products of nature-to be held in accord with nature by means of metaphorical disciplines, social and psychological, intending harmonization of the individual will with the gen eral will and thereby with the will in nature. This is the idea already rec ognized in the Mesopotamian number 43 ,200 and its transformations (see pages 9-12) , correlating, as of one measure, the cycles of the celestial spheres, periods of historic time, and pulsations of the human heart. Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) adds that in the Indian yogic schools it is held that all living beings exhale and inhale 21,600 times a day: 29 21,600 X 2 = 43,200. In such a context, since the macrocosm (order of the universe) , micro cosm (order of the individual) , and mesocosm (order of the attuned soci ety) are equivalent, the social ideals and moral principles by which the individual is constrained to his group are conceived to be, finally, of his own nature. And for the same reason, the visionary realizations of the yogi in solitude would be of the psychological sources out of which the meso cosmic order of his mythologically grounded cultural monad originated. There is not, therefore, in this ancient manner of understanding man in re lation to his universe, anything like those tensions of conflicting aims and values which the late Daisetz T. Suzuki remarked in our own biblically in spired, occidental way of relating to "nature" and the "spirit" as a pair of opposites: "Nature [here] is something hostile to Man and drags him down when he is struggling to reach God," Suzuki remarked. And he quoted: "'The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak' [Matthew 26:41] . Man is against God, Nature is against God, and Man and Nature are against each other. God's own likeness (Man) , God's own creation (Nature) and God himself-all three are at war. " 3° At what time and in what place or places, then, did the great Eurasian constellation originate of those macro-micro-mesocosmic metaphors, ritualized devotions addressed to the same, and psychophysiological exer cises reconfirming them, of which the Indian gurus, Tibetan rimpoches, and Japanese Zen masters are the inheritors? The evidences so far consid ered, from India, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, suggest some time and place

within the period and region of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age civilizations of the Near and Middle East, say c. 3 500-2500 B.C. The prob lem is complicated, however, by such tokens from Native America as, for example, the Navaho sand painting already noticed, where the imagery and connotations so perfectly match those of the ascent of the sushumnii that if the painting had come from Tibet, instead of from New Mexico, an immediate connection could be assumed without hesitation. My own realization that there was a problem here to be recognized occurred about forty years ago, when I was preparing for publication by the Bollingen Foundation a series of pollen paintings and their associated myth that had been received from an old Navaho medicine man, Jeff King (who in 1964 died at about the age of no) . Jeff King had declared that his paintings were derived "from a cave on the east slope of a certain moun tain," which he had first visited in boyhood and could visit again whenever he wished to refresh his memory of the paintings. "Outside the cave," he said, "was a stone carving of two snakes intertwined, the heads facing east and west. " Since his last visit, however, the serpent monument had been underwashed by water and had collapsed, so that it was now no more. 31 One hardly knows what to think of such a story. A stone carving in New Mexico? A form of Hermes's caduceus with the heads facing east and west instead of toward each other? My skepticism became qualified when I dis covered among a series of figures reproduced from the pre-Columbian Codex Fejervary-Mayer (now preserved in Liverpool, England) an example of just such a modified caduceus as Jeff King had described (see Figure 14) . 32 Whether his stone carving had been of hard rock or of his own imagination, therefore, the form of it, as it now appeared, was traditional. From what source, however, the tradition? In the 1950s R. Gordon Wasson's investigations of the Mexican pre Columbian mushroom cult (in collaboration with Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist renowned for his discovery of LSD in 1943) established beyond question the prominence of hallucinogens in the religious exercises of the whole Mayan-Aztec culture field. The same investigators in conjunction with the classicist, Carl A. P. Ruck, have lately revealed the likelihood of the influence of a hallucinogen (ergot of barley) in the Greek mysteries of Eleusis. 33 Already in 1968, Wasson published his disclosure of the mysterious Vedic sacramental, Soma, as probably a product of the mushroom Amanita

scribing his own visionary experiences under the influence of mescaline,
opened the way to a popular appreciation of the abiliry of hallucinogens to
render perceptions of a quasi- or even truly mystical profundi ty. There can
be no doubt today that through the use of such sacramentals revelations in
distinguishable from some of those reported of yoga have been experienced.
Nor can there be any doubt that the source of the revelations is the psyche of
the practitioner-the unconscious, that is to say. They are revelations, that is
to say further, of the archetypes of the collective unconscious, elementary

ideas a priori of the species Homo sapiens sapiens, such as may appear spon taneously no matter where. Returning to an anthropological vocabulary, we may then feel safe in suggesting that such symbols as the caduceus might well have appeared in India, Greece, Ireland, and New Mexico independently, by "paral lelism, " out of the common ground of what C. G . Jung has termed the collective unconscious. The problem that confronts us in Mesoamerica, however, is not simply of a great number of archetypal features of this kind duplicating features known from Eurasia, but of a distinctive con stellation of such features: seasonal festival calendars based on mathemati cally registered astronomical observations, marking cycles upon cycles of solar, lunar, and planetary periods; a magnificent serpent deity, the Feathered Serpent (Mayan Kukulcan; Nahuatl Quetzalcoatl) , incarnated as a god-man and king, who dies and is resurrected; temple towers sug gesting Mesopotamian ziggurats; religious images, incense, music, and hi eratical processions; and so on and on. It perhaps is merely coincidental that whereas the basal starting date of the Mayan ceremonial calendar is 3113 B.c., 35 in India the beginning of the present "Great Cycle" (Mahiiyuga) of 4,320,ooo years is supposed to have occurred on February 18, 3102 B.c.36 Independent observation of the same celestial phenomena as those recognized in Mesopotamia centuries before might well have in spired almost identical cosmologies, distinguished from each other princi pally by the fact that the Mayan calendar was controlled by a mathematical system of base 20, intermeshing with a week of thirteen days, whereas the early Sumero-Babylonian calendar was of base 6o with a five-day week. One can only wonder considering, as I have now been considering for some forty-odd years, the likenesses, both in breadth and in depth, of the two constellations of metaphorical images of the Old World and the New, whether the human psyche can possibly be so thoroughgoingly pro grammed that these two all but identical constellations might indeed have arisen independently in the separated hemispheres of our planet. Some idea of the astonishing intimacy in detail of the great convergence (if that, indeed, is what it is) may be gained simply by confronting, as though of one and the same mystical heritage, such an example of New World

iconography as the Navaho sand painting pictured hereafter (see Figure 15, page 71) and the wisdom-lore of India's Old World yoga: treating the first as of the way of what Ramakrishna called the "lovers of God" (see page 40-41) , and the other as of the fearless "knowers."

In the Navaho sand painting the bounded area is equivalent to the inte rior of a temple, an Earthly Paradise, where all forms are to be experi enced, not in terms of practical relationships, threatening or desirable, evil or good, but as the manifestations of powers supporting the visible world and which , though not recognized in practical living, are every where immediately at hand and of one's own nature. The painting is used in a blessing ceremony, for healing, or to impart the courage and spiri tual strength requisite to the endurance of some ordeal, or for the per formance of some difficult task. The dry painting is of colored sand strewn (with amazing skill and speed) upon the dirt floor of a native dwelling, or hogan. Neighbors and friends have assembled, and for a pe riod of one to five (in many other rituals, nine) continuous nights and days of chanting, prayer, and metaphorical acts, the patient or initiate is ceremonially identified in mind and heart and costume with the mytho logical protagonist of the relevant legend. He or she actually enters physi cally into the painting, not simply as the person whose friends and neighbors have solicitously assembled, but equally as a mythic figure en gaged in an archetypal adventure of which everyone present knows the design. For it is the archerypal adventure of them all in the knowledge of their individual lives as grounded and participative in a beloved and ever lasting pattern. Moreover, all the characters represented in the ceremo nial are to be of the local landscape and experience, and become mythologized, so that through a shared witnessing of the ceremonial the entire company is renewed in accord with the nature and beauty of their spiritually instructive world. The conformity of the imagery of this particular sand painting to the sense and symbolized experiences of the yogic sushumnd is certainly as tonishing, but not more so than many other concordancies in the myths and ritual arts of peoples across the world. The axial Great Corn Plant

corresponds here to the sushumnii; the footprints represent a spiritual as cent along the mystic way known to the Navaho as the Pollen Path. There is a verse from a sacred chant:
In the house of life I wander On the pollen path, With a god of cloud I wander To a holy place. With a god ahead I wander And a god behind. In the house of life I wander On the pollen path. 37
The Great Corn Plant's upper half is marked by a lightning flash, which immediately suggests the oriental vajra ("thunderbolt of enlighten ment") of Hindu and Buddhist iconography. It strikes to the exact center of the way, which corresponds (if we count the leaf-marked stages, the tas sel above, and the root below) exactly to the fourth cakra, aniihata, where the sound is heard that is not made by any two things striking together (see page 36) . In Navaho myths and legends the god known as Sun Bearer, Ts6hanoai, possesses lightning-arrows. His domicile is above, in the sky, and when his twin sons, conceived of him by an earthly virgin, Changing Woman, arrived to receive from him the power and weapons with which to rid the world of monsters, the solar power of which they then became possessed was so great that when they returned to earth it had to be modi fied by a deity known as Hastyeyalti (Talking God) , maternal grandfather of the pantheon, in whom male and female powers are combined. 38 In the sand painting, the realm of operation of this second god is represented by a modified rainbow of two colors, red and blue (brick red and blue gray in the color reproduction) , symbolic respectively of solar energy and of water and the moon. The high place onto which the Twins descended from the heavenly house of their father to earth was the central mountain of the world (locally, Mt. Taylor in New Mexico; height, 11,302 feet) and the corresponding station in the painting is at cakra 4, aniihata. Moreover, the root of the corn plant is threefold, like Yuktatrive�i in the muliidhara (see pages 43 , 50) . The pollen path commences lower right and is of two colors, like the modified rainbow (or like the moon, which is of both

matter and light) . But at the turn between the Spirit Bringers the path be comes yellow and single (like the fire of the blended breaths, exploding to ascend the sushumnii; see pages 44-45) ; after which, in a sacred way, to an accompaniment of chants and prayer, the sanctuary is entered. The parallelism of the tantric visionary ascent of the sushumnii and the ritually controlled transit of the Navaho Pollen Path is not simple to ex plain. We know that in Tibetan tantric colleges such as Gyudto in Lhasa, a strictly controlled tradition of ritualized sand painting was practiced until the calamity of 1959. We know also that the Navaho are a people of Athapascan stock, from northwesternmost North America, who migrated to the Southwest some time around the twelfth century A.D. The Athapascans of the Canadian Northwest, however, do not practice sand painting. The Navaho seem to have acquired the art from the Pueblo tribes around whose villages they settled. Any relationship between the Pueblos of New Mexico and the great monasteries of Lhasa is impossible, not only to document, but even to imagine. We are thrown back, there fore, for the present at least, upon the academically unpopular psychologi cal explanation of the undeniable parallelism of these two visionary journeys, one, of an ecstatic, immediately visionary kind, the other, by way of a tribal ceremonial . That the experience of an ascent of the sushumnii is of a psychological order is hardly questionable. And that the visions are culturally condi tioned (as are all visions and all dreams) is certain; for every petal of the en visioned lotuses, from the four petals of the muliidhiira to the two of iijfiii and thousand of sahasriira, bears a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. Yet de scriptions of the lotuses by those who have experienced them carry the con viction of a reality, not indeed of a gross material (sthula), but of a subtle (sukshma), dreamlike, visionary kind. "They are formed of Consciousness," said Ramakrishna, "like a tree made ofwax-the branches, twigs, fruits, and so forth all of wax." 39 "One cannot see them with the physical eyes. One cannot take them out by cut ting open the body." 40 "Just before my attaining this state of mind, " he told his company of followers, "it had been revealed to me how the ku�rjalin'i i s aroused, how the lotuses of the different centers blossom forth, and how all this culmi nates in samiidhi. This is a very secret experience. I saw a boy twenty-two



66 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
or twenty-three years old, exactly resembling me, enter the sushumnti nerve and commune with the lotuses, touching them with his tongue. He began with the center at the anus and passed through the centers at the sexual organ, navel, and so on. The different lotuses of those centers-four petalled, six-petalled, ten-petalled, and so forth-had been drooping. At his touch they stood erect. "When he reached the heart-1 distinctly remember it-and com muned with the lotus there, touching it with his tongue, the twelve petalled lotus, which was hanging head down, stood erect and opened its petals. Then he came to the sixteen-petalled lotus in the throat and the two-petalled lotus in the forehead. And last of all, the thousand petalled lotus in the head blossomed. Since then I have been in this state." 41 In the sand painting of the Pollen Path, the two colors of the "female" and the "male," lunar and solar powers, having become one on passing between the guardian Spirit Bringers at the entrance to the sanctuary; the path, which is now of the single color of pollen, runs to the base of the World Tree, where three roots or ways of entrance are confronted. Those to right and to left point separately to the separated Spirit Bringers, whose arms and hands gesture together toward the portal of the middle way. The lower half, then, of the axial corn plant, which is to represent the graded stages of an initiation, is found signalized by a rainbow of the same two col ors that were already of the initiate's pollen path of virtue before its right turn to the Spirit Bringer's call. Now a rainbow is an insubstantial apparition composed of both mat ter and light, formed opposite the sun by reflection and refraction of the sun's rays in drops of rain. Thus it is at once material and immaterial, lunar and solar, as the matched colors, blue and red, here suggest. One thinks of the words of Goethe's Faust at the end of the opening scene of Faust, Pan II, where, bedded on a flowety turf, Faust wakes to an alpine sunrise and beholds across the valley a rainbow spread across the face of a mighty waterfall. The sun behind him being too powerful to contemplate directly, his eyes dwell, "with rapture ever growing, " upon the beauty of the insubstantial image formed of the sun's light refracted in the whirling spray of the tumbling torrent, and he exclaims, "So bleibe denn die Sonne



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religi o n 67
mir im Rucken ['So let the sun remain then behind me!'] . . . . Am forbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben ['Our living is in the colorful reflection'] . " For h e i s stationed a t the crucial turning point of cakra 4 , aniihata; there he must choose whether to pass, like an Indian yogi, to extinction in the full blast of the sun or to rest engaged in the field of action, held to the recognition of the play of the sun's light through all the forms given life by its power! The rainbow of the sand painting ends exactly midway of the path. There the lightning strikes, and to right and to left two apparitions appear. These are of a spiritual messenger-fly known to the Navaho as Dontso, "Big Fly, " and in his second aspect, "Little Wind." In art and myth this little figure holds a prominent place, and like everything else in Navaho mythology, he is a transformation into metaphor of an actual feature of the environment. There is, namely, a local tachinid fly, of the species Hystricia pollinosa van der Wulp, which has the habit of lighting on a person's shoul der or on the chest j ust in front of the shoulder. 42 In this role it has been admitted to the pantheon as a bringer of news and guidance and as a mes senger of the spirit. In its present, dual apparition, black and pale yellow, it represents separately the male and female energies, which in the rainbow are united. For both black and red, in the color system of this painting, are symbolic of male energy, while both yellow and blue are female. Black is sinister and threatening to life, yet also protects. The lightning flash here is black, and Black Wind (which here appears in the form of the black Dontso) is the power of the sun. 43 Yellow represents, in contrast, fructifi cation, pollen, and the powers of vegetation. Women originated from a yellow corn ear, and yellow is the color of an inexhaustible food bowl sym bolizing sustenance. 44 The black zigzag line of the lightning flash is single, whereas in the rainbow, where the male power has been tempered to the female power, the male is red and the female blue. Red is the color of dan ger, war, and sorcery, but also of their safeguards; for it is the color, as well, of blood, flesh, and nourishing meat. 45 Blue is a color associated by the Navaho with the fructifying power of the earth, with water and with sky. 46 Combined as here in a rainbow, the two are known as "The Sunray" and said to stand for "light rays emerging from a cloud when the sun is behind it . . . " 47

The cornstalk of this painting is blue, and upon the central corn tassel at its top there is a bird, also blue, symbolic, it is said, of dawn, happiness, and promise. 48 The only two ears of corn to be seen are at nodes corre sponding (by analogy with sushumnii) to cakras 3 and 4, ma1Jipura and aniihata, both of which are associated with powers and realizations of the period, in a lifetime, of maturity-mastery and illumination-which may or may not be by coincidence. For the artist to whom we owe the reproduction of this precious docu ment of an orally communicated tradition that is rapidly disappearing did not receive an interpretation of its symbols from the Singer (the Medicine Man) from whose Blessing Rite it was drawn. We now have, however, an ample resource of well-collected materials authoritatively interpreted, as sembled by scholars chiefly of the 1930s and 1940s (when the normal Navaho household was said to have comprised a father and mother, one child and two anthropologists) , out of whose publications a substantially acceptable reading of such an iconographic work can be confidently re constructed. My own researches in the material were undertaken in those same years of the 1930s and 1940s in connection, partly, with my task of editing, for the opening of the Bollingen Series, Maud Oakes's collection of paintings from the war ceremonial of the old Navaho warrior and medicine man Jeff King (18 52/6o(?)-1964, now buried with honors in Arlington National Cemetery) , Where the Two Came to Their Father, published in 1943. 49 At the same time I was at work with Henry Morton Robinson on A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944) , besides helping Swami Nikhilananda with his translation from Bengali of The Gospel ofSri Ramakrishna (1942) , having j ust commenced the twelve-year task of editing for the Bollingen Series four publications from the posthumous papers of my deceased friend Heinrich Zimmer: Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization (Bollingen Series VI, 1946) , The King and the Corpse (Bollingen Series XI, 1948) , Philosophies ofIndia (Bollingen Series XXVI, 1951) , and The Art ofIndian Asia, in two volumes (Bollingen Series XXXIX, 1955) . My distinct impression throughout those years was that I was at work only on separate chapters of a single mythological epic of the human imagination. Moreover, the epic was the same as that to which I had been



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religi o n 69
introduced twenty years before in my graduate studies at Columbia University in anthropology and European romantic and medieval litera tures; in Paris at the Sorbonne on the Proven<;:al poets and Arthurian ro mance; and at the University of Munich in Sanskrit and Far Eastern Buddhist art. Adolf Bastian's theory of a concord throughout the mythologies of the world of certain Elementargedanken, "elementary ideas" (Das Bestiindige in den Menschenrassen, Berlin, 1868), was confirmed for me beyond question by these apparently far-flung researches. The first task of any systematic comparison of the myths and religions of mankind should therefore be (it seemed to me) to identify these universals (or, as C. G. Jung termed them, archetypes of the unconscious) and as far as pos sible to interpret them; and the second task then should be to recognize and interpret the various locally and historically conditioned transforma tions of the metaphorical images through which these universals have been rendered. Since the archetypes, or elementary ideas, are not limited in their dis tributions by cultural or even linguistic boundaries, they cannot be defined as culturally determined. However, the local metaphors by which they have been everywhere connoted, the local ways of experiencing and applying their force, are indeed socially conditioned and defined. Bastian termed such local figurations "ethnic ideas," Volkergedanken, and Mircea Eliade has termed them "hierophanies" (from hieros-, "powerful, supernatural, holy, sacred, " plus phainein, "to reveal, show, make known") . "The very dialectic of the sacred," Eliade declares, "tends to repeat a se ries of archetypes, so that a hierophany realized at a certain historical mo ment is structurally equivalent to a hierophany a thousand years earlier or later. " Furthermore, "hierophanies have the peculiarity of seeking to reveal the sacred in its totality, even if the human beings in whose consciousness the sacred 'shows itself' fasten upon only one aspect or one small part of it. In the most elementary hierophany everything is declared The manifesta tion of the sacred in a stone or a tree is neither less mysterious nor less noble than its manifestation as a 'god.' The process of sacralizing reality is the same; the forms taken by the process in man's religious consciousness differ.'' 50 The elementary idea is grounded in the psyche; the ethnic idea



70 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Spa ce
through which it is rendered, in local geography, history, and society. A hierophany occurs when through some detail, whether of a local land scape, artifact, social custom, historical memory, or individual biography, a psychological archetype or elementary idea is reflected. The object so in formed becomes thereby sacralized, or mythologized. Correspondingly, a religious experience will be realized when there is felt an immediate sense of identification with the revelation. The sense of a mere relationship is not the same. In popular cult the experience of relationship is frequently all that is intended. Thereby a sense of social solidarity may be rendered. Through identification, however, a transformation of character is ef fected.
METAPH O RI CAL I DENTI F I CATION
In the Blessing Ceremony o f the Navaho the psychosomatic healing of spiritual initiation is accomplished by means of an identification, ritually induced, of the patient or initiate with the mythological adventure of the Pollen Path in its threshold crossings into and through a sacred space and out into the world transformed. We have not been told by what specific prayers, chants, and metaphorical acts the adventure is conducted. The pictorial statement of the painting, however, indicates the transformative stages. Footprints ofwhite cornmeal mark the path of the initiate throughout. As already noticed, they approach along a road that is of the two symbolic colors of the male and female powers, fire and water, sunlight and cloud, which at the place of the Spirit Bringers abruptly blend to one golden yel low of the color of pollen. The same color of pollen then appears border ing the outspread sacred space, which in this way opens to a display of the indwelling powers of pollen. There are no footprints on this part of the path. To be assumed is a threshold passage of the mind as it turns from secular anxieties, identifica tions, and expectations, to a game of make believe ("as if"; als ob, recalling Kant; see pages 29-30) , assuming an intentionally metaphorical, mythologi cal cast of hierophantic personifications. The Navaho have a number of procedures to effect this indispensable alteration of consciousness: sweat baths, solemn recitations of the names of the gods to be represented in the

rite, heraldic face and body painting, with an investiture of ornaments such as the god with whom the candidate is to identify would be wearing. The ordeal is an act of sacrifice. The mind is to abandon forever the whole way of relating to life that is of the knowledge of the two powers of the path only as distinct from each other, red and blue. Beyond the exit gate, returning to the world, the path is to be no longer red and blue, but of the one color of pollen. The neighbors and friends who have gathered to witness the occa sion will experience an exaltation, but then return to the world along the path by which they carne; for their participation will have been, not of iden tification, but of a relationship--something comparable to the attendance by a Roman Catholic family at Holy Mass, whereas the initiate, nearly naked and decorated as a god, will have become identified with the adven ture, as in the way of the words of Jesus reported in the Thomas Gospel: "Whoever drinks from My mouth shall become as I am and I myself will become he, and the hidden things shall be revealed to him" (Logion 109) . 51 When footprints reappear in the painting they are already in or on the cornstalk, and Oontso has appeared as at once female and male, yellow and black, in two aspects: the one as two and the two as one. Moreover, the path of blue and red is now beheld in the luminous form of the Sunray, no longer of solid matter, but of light and cloud. In the Hindu ascent of the sushumnii, the cakras of the lower centers are identified, respectively, as of the elements Earth, Water, and Fire, the associated divinities being Brahma the Creator, Vigm as Preserver and Lover, and Siva as the Destroyer of Obstructions to Illumination. The in volved yogi becomes to such a degree absorbed in these morphogenetic ar chetypes that as the ku�tf,alini ascends, the whole body below the center of concentration goes cold. As stated by Sir John Woodroffe: "There is one simple test whether the Sakti [the energy as ku�tf,alin� is actually aroused. When she is aroused intense heat is felt at that spot, but when she leaves a particular center the part so left becomes as cold and apparently lifeless as a corpse. The progress upwards may thus be externally verified by others. When the Sakti {Power) has reached the upper brain (sahasriira) the whole body is cold and corpse-like; except the top of the skull, where some warmth is felt, this being the place where the static and kinetic aspects of Consciousness unite." 52 Ku�tf,alini yoga practiced in this outright way, in other words, is not a



74 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
game of "as if" and make-believe, but an actual experience of psychologi cal absorption in a metaphysical ground of some kind, a morphogenetic field that has not yet, as far as I know, been scientifically recognized in the West except by C. G. Jung and, lately, by the physicist Rupert Sheldrake, whose works, according to one concerned scientific reviewer, ought to be burned. Ramakrishna, who surely knew whereof he spoke, warned (as we have already learned), that not only is this form of yoga extremely difficult, but also should not be practiced by the lovers of God, since (in his words) : "To one who follows it even the divine play in the world becomes like a dream and appears unreal; his 'I' also vanishes. " 53 At cakra 4, aniihata, where the sound OM is first heard that is not made by any two things striking together, the element into which the yogi is absorbed is Air (viiyu, the life-breath; prii�a, spiritus, pure spirit) ; while at cakra 5 he devolves into iikiisa, Space. "Boundless am I as Space!" exclaims the ancient sage, �!avakra. "The phenomenal world is like an empty jar [enclosing Space, which nevertheless is boundless] . Thus known, phenomenaliry need be neither renounced, accepted, nor destroyed. " 54 In Dante's Divina Commedia the corresponding stage of spiritual ex altation extends through all but the last three cantos of the Paradiso (I-XXX) , telling of the visionary's ecstatic ascent, led by the spirit of Beatrice (Dante's Sakti) , from the garden of the Earthly Paradise on the summit of Mount Purgatory, through all the ranges of space to the outer most sphere of the Primum Mobile, by which the heavens are revolved.
A Light is thereabove which makes the Creator
visible to every creature that has
his peace only in beholding Him. It spreads so wide a circle that the circumference would be too large a girdle for the sun. Its whole expanse is made by a ray reflected from the summit of the Primum Mobile, which therefrom takes its life and potency. 55
The comparable figure in the Indian system is ofthe niida, the creative sound OM of the energy of the light, ever resounding in the iikiisa: beyond which "space," both in Dante's concluding can�os (Paradiso XXXI-XXXIII)



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 75
and in the stations six and seven of the Indian sushumnii, the culminating experiences are, first, of the vision of one's image of God and, then, of a transcendent Light which is the energy of the living world. In oriental art, the image, whether of the Buddha, of Brahma, of Vigm, or of Siva, is normally shown seated or standing upon a lotus. In Dante's vision, the Trinity with the whole heavenly host is beheld within the corolla of a radiant, pure white rose. 56 In the Navaho sand painting the final image above and beyond the enclosed white space of the pollen framed ceremonial field is of a symbolic bird perched on the central tassel at the top of the sacred corn plant. Noticing that the tassels are three, as are also the roots of the plant in the earth below, one is reminded that in Dante's Divina Commedia his vision of a Trinity above is matched by his Satan in the bowels of the earth (see page 49) , whose head shows three faces: the left face black, the right between white and yellow, and the middle red, signifying, respectively, in Dante's intention, ignorance, ha tred, and impotent rage, in express contrast to the wisdom, love, and om nipotence of the Godhead. 57 In the Old Norse image of the World Ash, Yggdrasil, upon which Othin hung himself for nine days and nights in a sacrifice of himself to Himself to gain the wisdom of the runes (the scripture of the gods) , 58 there is an eagle perched on the topmost branch, and beneath, a dragon gnaw ing at the roots, of which there are three. 59 The bird is a universal symbol of the spirit and spiritual flight, as is the feather of spiritual power. In India the wild gander, harhsa, is symbolic of the Iitman, the Self, and such a per fected saint as Ramakrishna is known as a Paramaharhsa, ("Paramount or Supreme Wild Gander") . Jesus at the moment of his baptism saw a dove descending from the heavens. Zeus approached Leda in the aspect of a swan. Serpents and dragons, in contrast, are of the earth, its dynamism, urges, and demonic wisdom. "The Pharisees and the Scribes have received the keys of Knowledge," said the Gnostic Jesus to St. Thomas and the disciples, "they have hidden them. They did not enter, and they did not let those enter who wished. But you, become wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Logion 39) . 6o For the two modes of consciousness are of the one life, whereas the cherubim and flaming sword have forbidden entrance, even of the "j usti fied," to the earthly garden where the two become again one.



76 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Space
Accordingly, in Dante's vision, Heaven and Hell are still separate, and the lower power (ethically judged) has been eternally condemned. The de scent of the spirit is a fall. The life-giving demon has become a devil. The axial tree of the universe, around which all revolves, that is to say, is still cut in two, as it was in Yahweh's Eden of the two trees, one, of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the other, of the Knowledge of Eternal Life. Whereas in the unreformed, primeval archetype of the World Tree, such as appears in the Old Norse Yggdrasil and in the Navaho Blue Corn Stalk, the life-giving roots and the pollen-bearing flowerings, or tassels, are of a single, organically intact, mythological image. In the metaphorical Promised Land or Earthly Paradise of the Navaho sand painting (paradise, from the Greek paradeisos, "enclosed park"; Old Persian pairi, "around," and daeza, "wall, " giving pairidaeza, "enclosure") , the rainbow curve, springing red and blue from the root, covers the zone of the first three cakras to the node of the second fruiting, where lightning strikes, flashing from the summit. The white footprints of the ceremonial path do not identify the initiate with either the rainbow or the lightning, only with the middle way; which is to say, apparently, that there is to be no absorption of the individual in identifications either with the gross mat ter of the world or with the unembodied light of sheer spirit. Both are rec ognized, evidently, as attributes of the Pollen Path. But the ordeal is to hold to the way between; so that even on coming to and passing the sta tion of the Bluebird (Paramaharhsa) , the path, now the color of pollen (which is the color by which the garden is enclosed) , does not ascend to the sky, but turning abruptly again to the right, bears the footprints back to the dwelling from which they came.
TH E NET OF G EMS
The yogi experiencing nondual identification of the Self (iitman) with the Being, Consciousness, and Bliss which transcends yet moves the universe and all beings (sac-cid-iinanda brahman), may remain so fixed in this rap ture of cakras 6 and 7 ("realized disengagement, perfected isolation, ab solute unification," kaivalyam) that his body is abandoned, to continue as a dried leaf blown by a wind until it goes to pieces. Such, they say, is the spiritual state of the wandering mendicant, sannyiisin. As described by



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 77
Shankara: "Though doing, he is inactive, though bearing the fruits of past acts, unaware of them; disembodied though embodied, omnipresent though locally walking about: such a knower of brahman, everywhere liv ing on as though bodiless, is ever untouched by either pleasure or pain, goodness or evil. " 6I Or the one thus "released while living" (jivanmukta) may voluntarily return to the state of mind of cakra 4, either in the way of a Mahayana Bodhisattva whose "being" (sattva) is "illumination" (bodhi), touched by compassion for all suffering beings, who, renouncing for himself release from rebirth, returns to the world as a teaching savior (see again Philippians 2:6-8) ; or in the way simply of one fulfilled in the knowledge of an eternal mystery at play through himself as through all the produc tions of time, and who is thus competent to participate with joy and courage, in the sorrows of the world. As interpreted by Anhur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) :
If the ultimate Reality is one which exists in two aspects, of quiescent enjoyment of the Self in Liberation from all form and of active en joyment of objects-that is, as pure "Spirit" and [as] "Spirit" in mat ter-then a complete union with Reality demands such unity in both of its aspects. It must be known both "here" (Iha) and "there" (Amutra). . . . It is the one Siva who is the supreme blissful experience, and who appears in the form of man with a life of mingled pleasure and pain. Both happiness here and the bliss of liberation here and hereafter may be attained if the identity of these Sivas be realized in every human act. This will be achieved by making every human func tion, without exception, a religious act of sacrifice and worship ( Yajna) . . . . And so the Tantrik Sadhaka (adept) , when eating or drinking, or fulfilling any of the other natural functions of the body, does so, saying and believing, Sivo 'ham ("I am Siva"), Bhairavo 'ham ("I am Bhairava"), Sa'ham ("I am She") . It is not merely the separate individual who thus acts and enjoys. It is Siva who does so in and through him. 62
In the words of the legendary �tavakra: "Having realized the Self in all and all in the Self, released from egoism and the sense of 'mine' be happy (sukhi bhava, 'enjoy'] !" 63



78 Th e In n e r Rea c h es of O u te r Sp a ce
By comparison with these yogic realizations the initiations rendered through the Navaho sand paintings may be likened to that of cakra 4, where the sounding is heard of the syllable OM through all of nature. In The Indians ' Book (1907) , Natalie Curtis wrote of her attendance at a heal ing ceremony.
To the white man there is scarcely a more impressive sight than a group of Navahos chanting these ancient traditional songs, which have been learned and handed down with the greatest accuracy and care. The quiet, monotonous quality of the chant seems heightened by the concentration of the singers, who, with closed eyes or fixed gaze, bend evety thought upon their singing that they may not err in
word or sequence of the holy song.
At a healing-ceremony in some hogan where there is sickness, the steady rhythm of the medicine-songs pulses all night long, groups of
singers on opposite sides of the fire vying with one another in en
durance. Does one group flag, another starts in freshly, and so, like the central pile of burning logs, the song flares unextinguished till the paling of the stars. Then comes a pause-the song changes; all the voices join in chanting, and then in measured cadence rises a Hozhonji song [a "Mountain Song"] to end the ceremony of the night and greet the coming day. The singing of a Hozhonji song is at all times an act of consecration. 64
These songs describe a journey to a holy place beyond the sacred mountains where are everlasting life and blessedness. The Divine O nes who live in and beyond the mountains made the songs, and so they tell of a journey as a home-coming. When these songs are sung over a man , the spirit of the man makes the journey that the song describes. Upon the rainbow he
moves from mountain to mountain, for it is thus that the gods travel,
standing upon the rainbow. The rainbow is swift as lightning. 65
Swift and far I j ourney,
Swift upon the rainbow.
Swift and far I journey,
Lo, yonder, the Holy Place!

"The Hozhonji songs," say the Navaho, "are holy songs, given to us by the gods." 67 Whatever the reality may be-the being or nonbeing-of the mysteri ous morphogenetic field into which the enraptured yogi lets dissolve his humanity and its world, detailed comparative studies of the tantric iconog raphies associated with those raptures and the greatly various yet morpho logically homologous initiation rites and mythologies of revelation that have been observed and recorded from every part of the planet, make it ev ident that the yogi is losing himself in exactly those psychological {and therefore biologically grounded) universals-Adolf Bastian's "elementary ideas," C. G. Jung's "archetypes of the unconscious"-which have been forever the connoted field of reference of the metaphors of myth. The burnt-out, wandering sannyiisin has followed the connotations to the end. Fulfilled gurus, seers, incarnations, and saviors, speak frequently as with one vmce. Said the Gnostic Jesus: "If those who lead you say to you: 'See, the Kingdom is in heaven, ' then the birds of the heaven will precede you. If they say to you: 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. But the Kingdom is within you and it is without you. If you will know yourselves, then you will be known and you will know that you are the sons of the Living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you are in poverty and you are poverty" (Logion 3) . 68 "I am the Light that is above them all, I
am the All, the All came forth from Me and the All attained to Me"



Metap h o r As My th a n d A s Religio n 81
(Logion 77) . 69 "Whoever drinks from My mouth shall become as I am and I myself will become he, and the hidden things shall be revealed to him" (Logion w8) . 7° "I am the universal iitman, I am the All!" exclaims the illuminated disciple of the great guru of gurus, Shankara. "I am transcendent, nond ual, unrelated, infinite knowledge. Sheer bliss am I, indivisible . " 71 And from the master Agavakra: "You pervade the universe and the universe exists in you. You are by nature Pure Consciousness. Do not be small minded!" 72 The universally distinguishing characteristic of mythological thought and communication is an implicit connotation through all its metaphori cal imagery of a sense of identity of some kind, transcendent of appear ances, which unites behind the scenes the opposed actors on the world stage. Schopenhauer, in his bold and really magnificent "Transcendent Speculation upon an Apparent Intention in the Fate of the Individual" (1850), 73 takes up the idea, remarking that in the later years of a lifetime, looking back over the course of one's days and noticing how encounters and events that appeared at the time to be accidental became the crucial structuring features of an unintended life story through which the poten tialities of one's character were fostered to fulfillment, one may find it dif ficult to resist the notion of the course of one's biography as comparable to that of a cleverly constructed novel, wondering who the author of the sur prising plot can have been; considering further, that as the shaping of one's own life was largely an effect of personalities accidentally encountered, so, too, one must oneself have worked effects upon others. The whole context of world history, in fact, is of destinies unfolding through time as a vast net of reciprocal influences of this kind, which not only are of people upon people, but involve also the natural world with its creatures and accidents of all kinds. Invoking the analogy of dream, the philosopher reminds his reader that in dream the unanticipated occurrences, which appear to be ac cidental and occasionally, as in nightmare, terrifYing, are actually of a con text composed and controlled according to an unsuspected intention which is of none other than one's own will, "put forward from a stand point, however, that is not of the dreaming consciousness. " 74 Comparably, the dream or nightmare of our lives is a production of our own hidden will.



82 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
But the dreams and lives of all interlock, as though of a single, superordi nated context; "so that," as the philosopher observes, "in the way of a veri table Harmonia praestabiliter, each dreams only to accord with his own metaphysical associations, yet all the life-dreams are interlocked so artfully that each, though experiencing only what is profitable to himself, is yet ful filling the requirements of others. . . . "Our hesitation before such a colossal thought will perhaps be dimin ished by the recollection, " Schopenhauer suggests in conclusion, "that the ultimate dreamer of the vast life-dream is finally, in a certain sense, but one, namely the Will to Live, and that the multiplicity of appearances fol lows from the conditioning effects of time and space [the morphogenetic field whereby the Will to Live assumes forms] . It is one great dream dreamed by a single Being, but in such a way that all the dream characters dream too. Hence, everything links and accords with everything else." 75 The Indian image of the "Net of Gems," where in every gem of the net all the others are reflected, is a counterpart of this idea. Another likeness may be seen in the Buddhist doctrine of "mutual arising" (pratitya-samutpiitkz), as represented in the Mahayana "Flower Wreath Siitra," the Avata-rrzsaka Qapanese, Kegon), which has been defined as a theory of the "causation of the universe and its events by the common action-influence of all beings." 76 Another image is of the Hindu divinity Vi�.Q.U couched on the back of the Cosmic Serpent, Ananta ("Unending") , floating on the Cosmic Milky Ocean, dreaming the dream of the Universe-to which image and universal dream James Joyce in Finnegans Wake correlated, with an Irish twist, the whole spectacle of world history. Schopenhauer was apparently the first philosopher to realize that Immanuel Kant in The Critique ofPure Reason (1781) not only had demol ished the philosophical mansions both of Cartesian rationalism (the French eighteenth-century Enlightenment) and of Baconian empiricism (Anglo-Saxon "common sense") , but also had established the prerequisites for a correlation of oriental and occidental metaphysical terms. For Kane's a priori forms of sensibility (time and space) and a priori categories of judgment-(!) of quantity: unity, plurality, and universality; (2) of quality: affirmation, negation, and limitation; (3) of relation: substantiality, causa tion, and reciprocity; and (4) of modality: possibility, actuality, and neces sity-are exactly India's miiyii (from the verbal root mii, "to form, to



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religio n 83
build") , that deluding faculty of mind by which brahman-titman ( = Kant's "Thing-in-itself") is veiled from direct experience and projected trans formed as the phenomena of space-time. Schopenhauer's own crucial contribution, then, was in his realization that whereas our outer eyes do indeed behold only phenomenal appear ances (Vorstellungen} within a three-dimensional field of space-time (Die Welt als Vorstellung), the inward experience of each and every one of those appearances is of him-, her-, or itself as a willing subject (Die Welt als Wille), this inward experience of the Will to Live then being, in fact, a veiled experience within oneself of the energy of titman-brahman, the uni versal Self, as linked however to sarrzstira (the temporal, apparitional field) by the apparition's own fear of death and desire for continued apparitional existence. The impulse of one's Will to Life, that is to say, is the inward ex perience of the Iitman as oneself; and the correlative outward experience of the Iitman as another occurs-as Schopenhauer recognized-on& by way of the insight of "compassion" (karu1J.ti), which is the quality of a Bodhisattva. "How is it possible," he asks in his celebrated essay On the Foundation ofMorality, "How is it possible that suffering that is neither my own nor of my concern should immediately affect me as though it were my own, and with such force that it moves me to action? . . . This is something really mysterious, something for which Reason can provide no explanation, and for which no basis can be found in practical experience. It is nevertheless of common occurrence, and everyone has had the experience. It is not un known even to the most hard-hearted and self-interested. Examples appear every day before our eyes of instant responses of the kind, without reflec tion, one person helping another, coming to his aid, even setting his own life in clear danger for someone whom he has seen for the first time, hav ing nothing more in mind than that the other is in need and in peril of his life . . . . " 77 Schopenhauer's answer to his question is that this immediate reaction and response represents the breakthrough of a metaphysical realization namely (as he states the idea in Sanskrit), "tat tvam asi, thou art that. " 78 "This presupposes," he declares, "that I have to some extent identified myself with the other and therewith removed for the moment the barrier between the 'I' and the 'Not-1'. Only then can the other's situation, his



84 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
want, his need, become mine. I then no longer see him in the way of an empirical perception, as one strange to me, indifferent to me, completely other than myself; but in him I suffer, in spite of the fact that his skin does not enfold my nerves. . . . " 79 "Individuation is but an appearance in a field of space and time, these being the conditioning forms through which my cognitive faculties appre hend their objects. Hence the multiplicity and differences that distinguish individuals are likewise but appearances. They exist, that is to say, only in my mental representation (in meiner Vorstellung). My own true inner being actually exists in every living creature as truly and immediately as known to my consciousness only in myself. This realization, for which the stan dard formula in Sanskrit is tat tvam asi, is the ground of that compassion (Mitleid) upon which all true, that is to say unselfish, virtue rests and whose expression is in every good deed. " Bo The metaphors of any mythology may be defined as affect signs de rived from intuitions of j ust this play of the Self through all the forms of a local manner of life, made manifest through ritualized representations, pedagogical narratives, prayers, meditations, annual festivals, and the like, in such a way that all members of the relevant community may be held, both in mind and in sentiment, to its knowledge and thus moved to live in accord. An atmosphere of dream prevails throughout, since everything is represented, and to be experienced, as the hierophany (to use again Eliade's term) of a mystery that is not of the plane of the manifestations themselves, but transcendent of their issues. "There is a dream dreaming us," declared a Kalahari Bushman to Laurens van der Post. La vida es suefio (Life Is a Dream) is the title of a play by Calderon. Everything in such a vi sion of the world-in-being is held and moves in relationship to everything else, to accord with an end that is not of the order of time, yet is every where fulfilled in time. William Blake's statement in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell "Eternity is in love with the productions of time," is an adumbration of the paradoxology of the game of hide-and-seek that Non duality is playing with and in celebration of itself in Ia divina commedia of this night of its dream.
Jose Ortega y Gasset, in his Meditaciones del Quijote (Meditations on Don Quixote, 1914) , wrote of the sobering crisis in occidental mentation



Me tap h o r A s Myth a n d A s Religio n 8 5
that occurred at the time o f Galileo's invention o f the telescope and appli cation of mathematical analysis to an exposition of the mechanical laws governing the universe. At that moment, nature, which formerly had been responsive to the psychological requirements and expectations of mytho logical heroes, became hard and fast and apan; so that when Don Quixote imagined himself to be riding his nag Rocinante against certain giants that his adventure required, what his lance actually encountered was the re volving sail of a windmill, which overthrew both him and his mount. He saved the adventure for himself, however, by inventing a magician who had transformed the required giants into windmills. From the standpoint of an exclusively mechanistic view of human ex perience and action, any such attribution to nature of "a presence . . . far more deeply interfused" as that of Wordsworth's poetic lines of meditation written above Tintern Abbey, or ofSchopenhauer's "Will in Nature," must be qualified in a derogatory sense as the romantic ascription to inanimate nature of human traits and feelings-the so-called pathetic fallacy: a senti mental projection of the imagination like Don Quixote's morbid fantasy of a magician's work in a windmill. Anthropologists, in the same vein, de scribe as "animism" the attribution in tribal mythologies, not only of con sciousness, but also of a discrete indwelling spirit, to every material form of reality, whether it be animal, plant, stone, star, moon, sun, or cyclone. While in the vocabulary of Judea-Christian theology, diabolism is the word for such beliefs. For already in the Old Testament, as in the post-Galilean sciences, there is in nature itself no divinity. There is no god in all the earth but in Israel (2 Kings 5=15) , and the gods of the Gentiles are devils. The texts of Christian missionaries to this same point in justification of their labors are legion, Satan himself being there recognized as even literally present in the idols, sacra ments, sorceries, and miracles of every worship but the mission's own. Such uninspired literalism in the understanding of mythological metaphors is difficult to match in the whole great field of the history of re ligions. In popular beliefs there is everywhere, of course, the notion of gods as living entities inhabiting a mythological zone beyond time. But that timeless zone is everywhere conceived to be the ground of the informing spirituality of the visible world itself. In dream and vision one enters into it, and on waking returns. Moreover, as such inward experiences have let



86 Th e In n e r Rea c h es of O u te r Spa c e
u s know, its apparitions are of a self-luminous substance revelatory of the vital energies, not only of ourselves but of all living things. The yogi allows his individuated mind to dissolve into the elementary vortices out of which these apparitions appear. In ceremonials such as that of the Navaho Spirit Bringers, their forms have become defined in art as local metaphors connotative of the universal powers they represent. However, the daunting biblical image of the flaming sword between the cherubim, turning every way at the gate of Eden to guard the way to the tree of eternal life, has kept separate the opposed powers of the two guardians, which in the image of the Navaho Pollen Path, no less than in that of the Indian sushumnii, must be brought together if the middle way is ever to be opened. In this excep tional tradition, Eternity and Time, Heaven and Earth, are permanently apart. There can be no reading of the images of God and Satan as metaphors of any kind. They are invisible, supernatural facts. And the crea tures of this visible earth are but dust, as is the earth itself (Genesis 3:19). Wherefore, as Blake declares in his own poetic revelation, The Marriage ofHeaven and Hell:
The cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at the tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite, and holy, whereas it now appears fi nite and corrupt. This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment. But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is to be expunged. If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would ap pear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' the nar row chinks of his cavern.
For modern Western man, that is to say. For in all other parts of the world, in-so-far at least as they have not yet learned of the garden of the two separate trees, Alles Vergiingliche ist nur ein Gleichnis, "Everything tran sitory is but a metaphor." 8r But equally, Alles Unvergiingliche ist nur ein Gleichnis, "Everything eternal is but a metaphor. " 82 For as already told, long since, in the Kena Upani�ad: "That [which is beyond every name and form] is comprehended only by the one with no comprehension of it: any



Metap h o r A s My th a n d A s Religi o n 87
one comprehending, knows it not. Unknown to the knowing, it is to the unknowing known." 83 Hence, as the light of the moon (a) is to that of the sun (b) , so my mor
tal life (c) and the lives of all around me (c ') are to that atman-brahman (x) which is absolutely beyond name, form, relationship, and definition.






CHAPTER III
THE WAY O F ART
My wife, Jean Erdman, who is a dancer and choreographer, discussing one day the relevance of an appreciation of the psychological connotations of myth to the practice of an art, remarked: "The way of the mystic and the way of the artist are related, except that the mystic doesn't have a craft." The craft holds the artist to the world, whereas the mystic, facing inward, may be carried to such an extreme posture of indifference to the claims of phenomenal life as that of the old yogi with his parasol of grass in the Hindu exemplary tale, "The Humbling of Indra" (pages 24-25) . The king-god of that tale, left sitting on his throne alone when the two humiliating apparitions had vanished like the figments of a dream, had no longer the slightest desire to go on with the construction of his palace. Unsettled forever in his conceit of himself as the governing power of the universe, he summoned his architect, Vishvakarman, thanked him for his engineering feats, heaped on him jewels and precious gifts, and after a sumptuous celebration, sent him home. Desiring nothing now but release from the burden of his inconsequential role, the god entrusted charge of the course of history to his son, and was on the point of retiring to prac tice yoga in the forest, when his beautiful and passionate queen, Shachi, turned in consternation for comfort and advice to the palace chaplain,



90 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Space
B�ihaspati, the Lord of Magic Wisdom, I ndra's spiritual adviser, who, with a wizard's smile, took her hand and led her to her husband's throne. There bowing before his majesty, the two settled on the floor before him, where B�ihaspati, the Lord of Language, commenced a golden discourse on the art of experiencing in the bond of married love the bliss transcending du ality. The king and his queen drank in the golden words, which were as a healing balm to their hearts. Indra relented in his extreme resolve. Shachi recovered her radiant joy. And B�ihaspati promised to compose for them a handbook on the mystery of marriage, wooing ever anew in the knowledge of each as both, to the end of time. 1 And so the wonderful story ends of the opening of the eyes of an un knowing, self-loving god to a dimension of being, transcendent of himself. Smitten by the full blast of the revelation delivered by two divinities, of a range of consciousness infinitely beyond that required for the competent performance of his own limited historical assignment, bewildered Indra had been about to desert both his public and his domestic orders of worldly duty for the self-satisfaction of self-dissolution in a mystic rapture of self-identification with the infinite, when by great good fortune he was res cued from the mania by the wit of his beautiful queen. Vi�I).U the Preserver, the first of the two divinities to have appeared be fore the complacent god, was an approximate counterpart of classical Apollo, who was also a protector of the dreamlike order of the delicately balanced phenomenal forms of this passing world. As a pedagogue, Vi�I).U appears whenever the universal balance is seriously threatened, as it cer tainly was in Indra's domain by the overload of ego in its ruling god's no tion of himself and of what the world owed him. In the way of a proper teacher, Vi�I).U was careful to let his pupil know that the message he was about to learn might be more than he could tolerate. However, with his pride already broken, the secondary god asked humbly to be taught. Siva the Destroyer, who in the instructive tale appeared in the charac ter of Hairy, is the Indian form of that Neolithic god of the generative power of nature who in Greece appeared as Dionysos. 2 As a god of the wilderness and the untamed beasts that inhabit it, Siva is Lord of the Lirigam (the phallos), which is symbolic of his generative power, and at the same time, the Lord of Yoga, those psychological disciplines in the ruthless practice of which the mystic, released from attachment to his



Th e Way of A rt 91
individual life, is identified with the consciousness of which life and the lives that life consumes are the reflection. The palace priest Brihaspati, the master of metaphorical speech, to whom the beautiful Queen Shachi turned in desperation for assistance, brought the whole burden of his art to the correction of the preposterous situation. For it is the function of the priest to represent the claims of life in the world, ethics against metaphysics, the art of living in the knowledge of transcendence without dissolving into it in a rapture of self-indulgence. Carl Jung somewhere has written that the function of religion is to pro tect us from an experience of God. Some fifty percent of the mythic tales in Ovid's Metamorphoses are of characters, ill-prepared, who were unfa vorably transformed by encounters with divinities, the full blast of whose light they were unready to absorb. The priest's practical maxims and metaphorical rites moderate transcendent light to secular conditions, in tending harmony and enrichment, not disquietude and dissolution. In contrast, the mystic deliberately offers himself to the blast and may go to pieces. Like the priest, the artist is a master of metaphorical language. The priest, however, is vocationally committed to a vocabulary already coined, of which he is the representative. He is a performing artist executing scripts already perfectly wrought, and his art is in the execution. Creative artists, in contrast, are creative only insofar as they are innovative. And of their in novations, two degrees are readily distinguished. One, the more immedi ately obvious, has to do with technical innovations; the other with innovative insights. It is to the latter, of course, that the title of this chap ter is intended to refer, and it was to the latter, also, that our opening ref erence to the mystic way was intended to apply. For the reality to which the artist and the mystic are exposed is, in fact, the same. It is of their own inmost truth brought to consciousness: by the mystic, in direct confronta tion, and by the artist, through reflection in the masterworks of his art. The fact that the nature of the artist (as a microcosm) and the nature of the uni verse (as the macrocosm) are two aspects of the same reality (respectively, as a minute part of the whole, experienced from within, and as the whole, viewed from without-equivalent, respectively, to Schopenhauer's "world as will" and "world as spectacle or idea") accounts sufficiently for that cre ative interplay of discovery and recognition which alerts the artist to the



92 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Space
possibility of a revelatory composition in which outer and inner realities are recognized as the same.
In his early novel A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man (written 1904-1914, published 1916) , James Joyce quotes Thomas Aquinas to the ef fect that "beautiful things are those that please when seen" (pulcra sum quae visa placent} .3 Beauty is thus a value, a good, an end in itself. Ugliness depresses, beauty exhilarates, heightening the sense of life, which again is a good in itself. Normally art aspires to beauty and thus to a sensuous glori fication of life: so that Nietzsche could write of the esthetics of art as "noth ing but applied physiology." 4 Whereas I'art pour /'art, in his view, was an aberration of the "Decadence" of his century: "the virtuosic croaking of cold-blooded frogs, despairing in their swamp. " 5 Beauty we may regard, then, as a normal and proper intention of the Way of Art, affirmative in its sensuous glorification of life, and thus grounded in physiology. To this degree, the Way of Art coincides with the Way of Beauty. However, there is another and further possible degree or range of the revelation of art that is beyond beauty, namely, the sublime, which has been defined as "that which arouses sentiments of awe and rev erence and a sense of vastness and power outreaching human comprehen sion." 6 Cosmic space and great distances may be experienced as sublime; also, detonations of prodigious power. If beauty so heightens our sense of life that esthetics may be termed "applied physiology, " the sublime, tran scending physical definitions, suggests magnitudes exceeding life; not re futing, but augmenting life. And from this perspective, viewing art! the same Nietzsche declared: "Art is the proper task of life, art is life's meta physical exercise. . . . Art is more worth than truth. " 7 Of the many statements by practicing artists of the first principles of their craft, the most lucid, concise, and helpful that I have been able to find is that of James Joyce in the last chapter of his novel just named, where he distinguishes between what he refers to as "proper" and "improper" art. The latter, in his construction, is art in the service of functions that are not prop erly, distinctively, and singularly of art. In the words of the young poet Stephen Dedalus, who in the novel is the author's alter ego: "Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end." 8 An essential detail here is the word "intelligible," by which our under standing of the Way ofArt is extended to include an order of beauty beyond



Th e Way of A rt 93
the immediately sensible, which is of matter beyond perception, purely con ceptual, apprehensible by the intellect only, and yet disposed for an esthetic end. The word is from the Greek aisthetikos ("perceptive"; aisthanesthai, "to perceive, to feel") and so has to do with sense experience, but also with feel ing. So that "proper" art, in Joyce's view, whether of sensible or of intelli gible matter, rests in esthetical, disinterested perception, apprehension, and feeling, whereas "improper" art is in the service of interests other than the esthetic-for example, ethics, economics, sociology, or politics. Improper art is of two orders: art that excites desire for the represented object, and art that arouses loathing or fear of it. Art that excites desire, Joyce calls pornographic. All advertising art is in this sense pornographic, since it is intended that the viewer should desire to possess in some man ner the object represented. Portraits are pornographic if they are no more than likenesses, intended rather to relate the mind in memory to the per son (or animal) portrayed than to hold the eye and sentiments to the pic ture itself, within its frame. Likewise, a landscape that is of interest rather as the advertisement or souvenir of some noteworthy place than as an es thetically engaging organization of sensible matter within a bounded field is in Joyce's sense pornographic. In India, as already noticed (see page 6) , such works are characterized as deii ("popular, local, provincial") and re garded as esthetically insignificant. Art that arouses loathing or fear, Joyce terms didactic. Derogatory satire, portrayal, and social criticism are didactic and therefore, in Joyce's sense, improper art. Fascist and Marxist art is, of course, deliberately di dactic; but in Europe and America as well, since the period of Emile Zola (1840-1902) , sociopolitical didacticiry has in many quarters become re garded even as the sole justification of art, which is otherwise "escapist" and "ivory tower. " All "improper" art, whether pornographic or didactic, thus moves one, or at least is meant to move one, to action, either with desire toward the object, or with fear or loathing away from it. It is therefore, as Joyce says, kinetic (Greek, kinetikos, from kinein, "to move") , whereas "proper" art is static (Greek, statikos, "causing to stand"). We speak of esthetic arrest. One is not moved to physical action of any kind, but held in sensational (es thetic) contemplation and enjoyment. In Joyce's words: "The mind is ar rested and raised above desire and loathing. " 9



94 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Space
It is this elevation of mind and, with the mind, the eye, above desire and loathing, desire and fear, that brings the way of art and the artist into relation to that of the mystic. Without this transformation at once of con sciousness and of vision, the portal of the mansion of art has not been en tered. Studio techniques alone, not only are of no use, but also may mislead even the gifted craftsman himself. Likewise on the mystic way, the acquisi tion of fantastic psychophysiological powers through yoga may lead the practitioner astray. This point is made in many Hindu legends telling of demons who by dint of extreme perseverance in yoga attained to such ex traordinary powers (siddhi) that they were able to overthrow the ruling gods and gain control of the universe. Vritra (the "Encloser") in the tale "The Humbling of lndra" (pages 20-25) was such a monster. And the effect upon the world of his reign was the creation of a universal Waste Land. Likewise, the effect upon the world today of the preponderancy in the popular mind of journalistic sociopolitical didacticism laced with pornographic entertain ment (expiring Rome's "bread and circuses, " panem et circenses) has been to release over the planet in this century the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Revelation 6:1-7) . What thunderblast of the spirit must be launched to blow this multiheaded Lord of the Century to smithereens? The blast will not make a lot of noise, nor will it break upon us all at once. In fact, the conditions for its coming are already here. As viewed by astronauts from the moon, the earth lacks those lines of sociopolitical divi sion that are so prominent on maps. And as recognized here below, the web of interlacing socioeconomic interdependencies that now infolds the planet is of one life. All that is required is a general change of vision to accord with these contemporary facts. And that this will occur is certain. It is, in fact, al ready occurring. Moreover, the vision required is nothing new, nor unnatu ral. What are unnatural, artificial and contrived, are the separations. Already in the nineteenth century, on the untamed Western Plains, a Native American, Black Elk (see pages 7-8) , in a shamanic vision of him self standing on the summit of the central mountain of the world-which, as he then knew, was everywhere, though for himself, locally, it was Harney Peak, South Dakota-saw that the sacred hoop of his people was one of many hoops that made one circle wide as daylight and as starlight. 10 Indeed, the idea is fully and even elegantly represented in the Great Seal of the United States, which appears engraved on the back of every dollar bill in our wallets.



Th e Way of A rt 9 5
There (see Figure 16) at the summit of a symbolic pyramid (the World Mountain) we see an eye within a radiant, upward-pointing triangle (the World Eye, God's Eye, Eye of Spirit) . It is at that point of rest (stasis) at the summit where the opposed sides come together. Above it is an inscrip tion: Annuit coeptis, "He or It (God, the Eye) has smiled on our undertak ings" (which is adapted from Virgil's Aeneid IX.625) . Below, displayed on a scroll, is another inscription: Novus ordo seclorum, "A new order of the world. " And along the base of the pyramid is a date, 1776, in Roman nu merals. Across the bill is an American bald eagle, bearing in its beak a scroll with the inscription Epluribus unum, "Our of many, one" (see Figure 17) . Above its head is a radiant solar disk enclosing the thirteen stars of the original thirteen states (thirteen being a number signifYing transcendence through a spiritual transformation) . The stars are symmetrically arranged to suggest the six-pointed symbol known as Solomon's Seal, or Star of David, which in India appears in the heart cakra, cakra 4 of the kuw/alini, the center of spiritual awakening (see Figure 3 and pages 36-37) , where it is symbolic of the spiritual condition of one who is, in life, enlightened. For the upward-pointing triangle is of the spiritual eye (compare the eye above the pyramid) , the downward-pointing triangle being of the claims of this temporal world. And the bald eagle is a local American form of the solar eagle, the bird and vehicle of Zeus, symbolic here of the mode of action in the field of time of a people inspired by the spirit. War and peace are rep resented by the arrows and laurel spray in the bird's talons, left and right, and the turn of the bird's head is to the laurel. The vision of Black Elk on the symbolic summit of Harney Peak, "see ing in a sacred manner," as he declared, "the shapes ofall things in the spirit, and the shape of all things as they must live together, like one being," had been achieved in the mystic way by an especially gifted shaman. In contrast, the elegant eighteenth-century engraving still to be seen on the back of our twentieth-century dollar bill represents a realization of the philosophical way pursued by that extraordinary company of deists to whom we owe the es tablishment, in reason, of this nation. Composed of elements adapted from a hermetic tradition of great antiquity and universality (undoubtedly as sembled from the library and great learning of Thomas Jefferson) , its picto rial vocabulary is so little understood today that many suppose the word "God" of its maxim, "In God we trust," to be a reference to the "God" of the Christian religion, which it is not. For the deists rejected the idea of the



96 The In n e r Reaches of O u te r Sp ace
"Fall" and, with that, the necessity for "Redemption," as well as the idea of a special Judeo-Christian revelation. Man's nature, in their view, is not cor rupt. The idea of God is innate in man's mind from the beginning; so that by reason alone man has arrived, everywhere, at a recognition of God which is sufficient. Religious intolerance is blasphemy, since in their primal ground and ultimate sense, all religions are one, as is mankind. The way ofart, when followed "properly" (in Joyce's sense) , leads also to the mountaintop that is everywhere, beyond opposites, of transcenden tal vision, where, as Blake discovered and declared, "the doors of percep tion are cleansed and every thing appears to man as it is, infinite. " u The engraving on the back of the dollar bill delivers its message as a work of art: in the way, however, of an illustration of concepts already formed, not as an affective, unprecedented image in itself. Many works of religious art are of this kind. They illustrate legends already known, of saints, angels, in carnations, and the like, and they commonly contain, like the deist en graving on the back of the dollar bill, standard symbolic devices which are addressed, not to the eye, but through the eye to the intellect, the mean ings of which can be known only to those already familiar with the illus trated tradition. Such a composition may grace the eye, but in itself it lacks magic, or, as Joyce would say, the "radiance" (claritas) of an achieved work of "proper" art. One's heart is waked, not by the form of the work, but by its content, and if the latter is of a tradition either unknown or deceased, the work may be of interest, like the dollar bill, economically, but it is no longer a work of living an. ·
Figure 16. Reverse, Great Seal of the United States. The Eye of the Holy Spirit, here shown at the summit of a Pyramid of Creation, is a counterpart of the Eye of Vi�1.1u mentioned in the Indian tale of the "Humbling of lndra" (page 25) . One may think of it as connoting, metaphorically, that mysterious "impulse" out of which the Big Bang of creation sent flying into distances that are still receding in ex panding space, hundreds of millions of exploding atomic furnaces which are seen from this earth as stars, constellations, and a Milky Way of innumerable points of light (see pages 2-3) . The present pyramid i s not, however, o f that first creation, but o f a second, a "new order of the world" (novus ordo seclorum), represented here as constituted of exactly 13 courses



Th e Way of A rt 97
allegorical of our 13 original states . And whereas behind the new pyramid there is only a desert to be seen, before and around it are the sprouting signs of a new and fresh beginning, dated 1776: 1 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 21. Mankind, that is to say, has herewith come of age and taken to itself responsibility and authority for the shaping of human l ives according to Reason. Moreover, between the dated course at the pyramid's base, which tells of an occur
rence in Time, and the Eye at the top, which is of Etern i ty, there are 1 2 courses, this being the n umber of signs of the belt of the zodiac as defining the limits of the physical world. The number 13 , accordingly, which is that of the dated course at the base, represents a cre ative transcendence of the boundary: not death, as appears in the popular superstition of 13 at table, bm an ach i eved life beyond death , as signified in the model of the table of the Last Supper, where the 12 Apostles were of the number of the signs of the belt of the zodiac by
which the physical world is bounded, whereas the incarnate God who was about to die, though indeed among them in the field of Time, was of Eternity, beyond the pale of death. Thus the number 13 of our 13 originating states is here interpreted and celebrated as the sign of a resurrection of life out of death, fresh leaves from a desert, a wholesome gift of the light of Reason as an awakener to maturity of the mind in its social conscience.

Figure 17. Obverse, Great Seal o f the United States. In the radiant disk above the American bald eagle's head the stars of the original 13 states are composed to form a Solomon's Seal symbolic of the union of soul and body, spirit and matter. Each of the interlaced equilateral triangles, one upward turned, the other downward, is a Pythagorean tetraktys, or "perfect triangle of fourness," of nine points, four to a side, enclosing a tenth representing the generative center ("still point of the turning world") out of which the others derive their force. The upward triangle is of spiritual, the downward pointing, of physical energy. Thus interlaced, the two represent the physical world recognized as informed by the spiritual, and in exactly this sense they appear at the Lotus Center of the awakened heart, cakra 4, in the symbolic Lotus series of the Indian kuwfalinf (Figure 3, page 37) . I n the Classical imagination, the 9 circumferential points o f the Pythagorean tetraktys were identified with the Muses and the point in the center with Apollo, around whose ra diant form the 9 dance. In Jewish thought, the sign of the two triangles together is known as "magen david" (Hebrew, miighen Diiwfdh), "Shield of David," and read as connoting the shekhfniih, or presence of God in Israel (as originally in the burning bush and in the cloud on the summit of Mr. Sinai) . In the Great Seal of the United States the reference is to the inspiration of the light of Reason in the constitution of the originating 13 colonies brought together as one nation: e pluribus unum, "out of many, one. " These are homologous, though culturally differentiated, interpretations of the same "elementary idea." When viewed as outlining a pyramid, the upward pointing triangle matches the pyra mid on the reverse of the Seal, with the single point at its apex corresponding to the Eye out of which the expanding form of the universe has proceeded. As symbolized in the tra ditional Pythagorean tetraktys, the energy emanating from that initial point (which is of the opening both from and to Eternity) yields, first, duality (2 points: measure and chaos, sub ject and object, light and dark, odd and even, male and female, etc.), which then relate to each other in three ways (3 points: either a dominant, b dominant, or a and b in accord) , whence derive all the phenomenal forms in the field of space-time (4 points: 4 quarters of the earth and heavens) . There is a verse in the Chinese Tao Teh Ching: "The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things" ( Tao Teh Ching 42, translation, James Legge) . Thus the ancient symbolism of the tetraktys: r point, 2 points, 3 points, and 4; which series when read in the opposite sense, of ascending or re turning to the source, yields the interesting series, 4 3 2 (for the sense of which, see pages
9-13).
Connotations o f the same order pertain, o f course, t o the downward turned tetrakrys, with its single point at the apex opening also from and to Eternity; so that "what is above is below," and the energy of the Spirit (however nar.1ed) , whether from without (as from the Eye, the apex above) or from within the world (the apex below) is one. Moreover, since from every terminal point of the six-pointed Solomon's Seal the same increasing series of 2 to 3 to 4 proceeds, it follows that the intended sense of the radiant symbol of 13 stars above the American bald eagle's head must have been the same essentially as that of Black Elk's remark, "The center is everywhere" (see pages 7-8)-above and below, north, south, east,

and wesr-wirh an additional eighreemh-cemury implication of rhe humanizing fight of
Reason reflected, universally, in rhe clarified consciousness of mankind. The number of srripes on rhe American eagle's shield is 13 ; so also rhe number of rhe arrows and of rhe leaves of rhe laurel spray in irs talons, while rhe n umber of rhe feathers of irs rail is 9 (see page 11 ) .
The artist fashioning a work of this kind serves in the way, rather, of the priest of an assured tradition than of an innovating creator, and the refine ment of his vocabulary can be astounding. Consider, for instance, the ele gant concision of the statement of the relationship of a theological ground to the polity of this nation, founded in benevolence and reason, that is rep resented in the ideogram of the outspread eagle on our dollar bill (Figure 17) : overhead, the rwofold tetraktys arranged in the form a Solomon's Seal of thirteen five-pointed stars; other recurrences of the number 13; the sum



IOO Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp ace
of the feathers in the eagle's tail (3 + 3 + 3) ; and the offered choices of either a spray of laurel or a sheaf of 13 arrows. It is ironical that today we should be passing around as legal tender these sociological manifestos without being able to read the message of democracy engraved on every one of them, the spiritual inspiration out of which their economic value has been derived. So that, not only the message, but even its vocabulary, have been lost. But also lost has been the power of all such recondite, iconographic art to melt the mind, enchant the heart, and cast a spell of esthetic arrest. For there has been a vast transformation of consciousness, not only in the Western world, but over the whole face of the earth, in the two brief cen turies that have elapsed since the dating in Roman numerals of that pyramid. James Joyce, in A Portrait ofthe Artist As a Young Man, like every one of those young artists of his time who, during the century that has now run its course, became the masters of the period, put his mind to the problem of reawakening the eye and heart to wonder. With the profound sense of a call, a vocation, he turned his mind (like the ancient Greek master crafts man Daedalus, when he found himself entrapped in a labyrinth of his own fashioning) to the invention of a hitherto unknown science of escape from bondage on "wings of art." And for instruction in the manufacture of such wings, he turned to Aristotle and to Aristotle's medieval disciple, Aquinas: "Aquinas says," states Stephen Dedalus, "Ad pulcritundinem tria re quiruntur, integritas, consonantia, claritas. I translate it so: Three things are neededfor beauty, wholeness, harmony, and radiance." 12
lntegritas {wholeness) : To appreciate the effect of this principle, the function ofwhich is to create an enclosed hermetic field of self-defined and self-defining, impractical relationships, one may regard any collection of objects whatsoever, say a clutter of things on a table, and in imagination put a frame around them. Everything within the frame is now to be re garded as one thing, not as a collection of unrelated objects of various use, but as the related parts of a composition. Those parts, say, of the table or of any of the other objects that are outside the frame are now "other, " and what is within the frame is one thing. "You see it," says Stephen, "as a whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is integritas." 13 Consonantia {harmony) : What is now important, and all that is now important, is whether this object or that is here, or there: the relationship of part to part, of each part to the whole, and of the whole to each of its



Th e Way of A rt 101
parts. This is the esthetic instrument: rhythm, consonantia. The parts may be objects, colors, words and their sounds, musical intervals, architectural fea tures and proportions. "You pass, " says Stephen, "from point to point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure." 14 Claritas (radiance) : When the rhythm has been fortunately struck, one is held to it in delight, with no sense of any other use for it. "You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing, " declares Stephen. 'The ra diance of which [Aquinas] speaks is the scholastic quidditas, the whatness of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is ap prehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole ness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart." 15 And this surely is the justification of art, its healing force and its won der: that beauty apprehended should have this power to illuminate the senses, still the mind, and enchant the heart. "Art," Cezanne has said some where, "is a harmony parallel to nature. " And I recall having heard the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle declare, as one of his maxims: "L 'artfait ressor tir les grandes !ignes de La nature. " For nature, as we know, is at once with out and within us. Art is the mirror at the interface. So too is ritual; so also myth. These, too, "bring out the grand lines of nature," and in doing so, reestablish us in our own deep truth, which is at one with that of all being. So that the artist, functioning in this "proper" way, is the true seer and prophet of his century, the justifier of life and as such, of course, a revolu tionary far more fundamental in his penetration of the social mask of his day than any fanatic idealist spilling blood over the pavement in the name simply of another unnatural mask. Wholeness, harmony, and radiance, then, are the prime requirements of any work of what Joyce would term proper art. In its own space, the ob ject or composition is set apart as a thing of beauty in its own nature, which is experienced as akin to that of the witness. There is a telling moment of



102 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Spa ce
impact when this recognition strikes, and one is held as by the mystery of one's own face in a glass. Therewith, the radiance. When the object is an other living being, this recognition is empathic, and where suffering, physi cal or mental, is represented (as in tragedy) the heart opens to compassion. Stephen Dedalus, addressing himself to this last type and degree of es thetic arrest, turns for guidance to Aristotle, in whose Poetics the tragic emotions named are pity and terror. "Aristotle," says Stephen, "has not de fined pity and terror. I have." And he proceeds to his definitions (the ital ics following are mine) : "Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatso ever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer." Not the poor, the black, the jobless sufferer, be it noted, but the human sufferer. We are penetrating the local, ethnic, or social mask to the human being. "Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of what soever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the se cret cause. " r6 Here we are moving toward an experience of the sublime. What is the secret cause of any moment of suffering? (This is the problem that the Buddha formulated as his First Noble Truth: "All life is sorrow ful.") Let us consider an example. Mr. A shoots and kills Mr. B. What is the secret cause of B's death? Is it the bullet? That is the instrumental, moving, or efficient cause. If we are writing about bullets, we may produce a tract on .gun control, but it will not be a work of proper art. Or let us say that Mr. A is a white man and Mr. B a black man. Is the secret cause of B's death racial conflict in the United States? If that is what we are writing about, the product may be an important novel of social criticism, but it will not be properly a tragedy or even a work of proper art. What, then, is the secret cause of Mr. B's death? I have chosen the illustration of a black man and a white man with the death in mind specifically of Martin Luther King, Jr. , on April 4, 1968, and with the brave words in mind that were reported of him shortly before the assassination, when he declared that he knew that by persisting in his populist crusade for justice, peace, and righteousness he was challenging, not simply opposition, but possible assassination; yet he pressed on. For here is a clue to the secret cause.



Th e Way ofA rt 103
In Aristotle's Poetics, tragedy is analyzed as a form of dramatic compo sition in which the leading character is by some passion or limitation brought to a catastrophe. But every life, either knowingly or unknowingly, is in process toward its limitation in death, which limitation is of the nature of life. Moreover, every significant act sets up a counterfield of resistance, in the way of the Buddhist doctrine of "dependent origination, or mutual arising" (pratztya-samutpiida). Opposites arise by mutual consent; so that the stronger the passion of one, the closer the limitation of the other. Dame Prudence advises care to the principle of limitation, tempering one's pas sion for life to the imminency of King Death. But the heroic life of deeds and fame is of the one whose passion bends Death's margin to the limit. In a work of "improper" art, such an assassination as that of Martin Luther King would have to be represented either as justified or as reprehensible. In a tragedy, in contrast, it would appear as the culminating revelation of the character and value of a lifetime; and since a work of "proper" art cannot say nay, but only yea, to life in life's celebration, such a death in high ca reer would be, beyond the sorrow of it, affirmed. And in this affirmation itself the mind is carried beyond, purged and cleansed of the fear of death. The word "catharsis" (Greek katharsis; from kathairein, "to cleanse") , which in Aristotle's usage denotes the effect of tragedy as "effecting through pity and terror a katharsis of these emotions," 17 was a term which referred in the Greek religious vocabulary to a spiritual transformation brought about by participation in a rite. The mind, "cleansed" of attach ments to merely secular aims, desires, and fears, is released to spiritual rap ture. Plato writes of katharsis, for example, as a "defeat of the sensations of pleasure. " 18 The ultimate effect, that is to say, is not to be of beauty (which "when seen pleases") , but of the sublime ("outreaching human compre hension") .19 The Greek theater was throughout its career associated with the shrines and festivals of Dionysos, who was a god, not only of the vine and drunken ecstasy, but also, more fundamentally, of the generative power of all life, the will in nature. His Hindu counterpart, as we have al ready said, is Siva, whom we have lately met in the character of Hairy (see pages 24-25) , and like Siva, Dionysos was a god at once of the wilderness and its untamed beasts, the phallus, and spiritual transport through "en thusiasm" (from the Greek enthusiazein, "to be inspired or possessed by a



104 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u ter Sp ace
god"). The Indian tantric saying niidevo devam arcayet, "by none but a god shall a god be worshiped," is a text speaking to this same state of possession. The art of the Greek tragedies of the fifth century B.c., which were com posed for and presented during the Great Dionysia at Athens, had origi nated from rhapsodic celebrations of the force of this universal deity's immanence, and hence influence, through every part of the web of human life. As James Joyce in the character of Stephen Dedalus perceived, how ever, the description by Aristotle of the means by which the G reek trage dians rendered to their audiences an affective experience of their god's immanence through every phase of the action of their plots remains un clear, because he did not (at least in the imperfect text of his Poetics that has come down to us) define pity and terror. Classical historians have, as a consequence, for the past 2.300 years, confused his "pity and terror" with desire and fear, interpreting katharsis, accordingly, as a "cleansing out" of pity and terror by means of a large dose of the same. But surely the mystical aim of the earlier rites can never have been to get rid of, but rather to inspire, pity and terror; for these are the two preeminent reli gious sentiments. What was to be achieved was a voiding of secular de sire and loathing (or fear) by a transformation of consciousness. Desire and loathing (or fear) are kinetic. They motivate the mind and feelings in relation to phenomenal appearances, moving one either to possess or to reject them. Pity and terror, on the contrary, are static. Pity (or perhaps better, compassion) arises in the recognition of shared humanity. In the drama this occurs in relation to the characters on stage. Moreover, the sufferings revealed through the episodes of a tragedy are not accidental or occasional, but "grave and constant," archetypal of human life. Thus a breakthrough is accomplished from biography to metaphysics, the back drop of time dissolves and the prospect opens of an occult power shap ing our lives that is at once of the universe and of each of us, a mysterium tremendum etfascinans, which is finally that everlasting fire which is ex ploding in the galaxies, blazing in the sun, reflected in the moon, and coursing as the ache of desire through our veins. "The way of the mystic and the way of the artist are related, except that the mystic doesn't have a craft." When the Prince Siddhanha, Gautama Shakyarnuni, rode from his



The Way ofA rt 105
palace in the dead of night on Kanthaka, his magnificent white stallion, with his charioteer, Chandaka, running swiftly at his side, he passed deep into the forest to a hermitage where he dismounted; and Kanthaka, bearing the empty saddle, was conducted back to the palace, where he died of grief. From one hermitage to another, one teaching sage to another, the fu ture Buddha passed in search of his way. For a time he joined a company of ascetics in a discipline of severe fasting, until with only skin and bone remaining, he considered: "But this certainly is not the way to passionless knowledge and liberation. " So he rose and left the fasting. And having bathed, thin as he was, in the lovely stream Nairanjana, supported by the trees along the shore as by a hand, he came back onto the bank. And as he was there resting, Nandabala, the daughter of a leading herdsman of those parts, approached with a rich bowl of milk rice, by which his body was re stored. And he rose and, alone, proceeded to the Bodhi tree, where he placed himself on the Immovable Spot, facing east. Then it was that there appeared before him the lord of the motivat ing powers of temporal life, whose three names are Kama ("Desire") , Mara (" Death") , and Dharma ("Social Duty") . And in his first charac ter, as Kama, the god displayed before the one there seated his three op ulent daughters, Desire, Delight, and Pining. But the Blessed One was unmoved. The god assumed, then, his form inspiring fear, and an army of ogres immediately taking shape around him flung weapons, fire, even mountains at the Blessed One, who remained, however, unmoved. And the hurled weapons became transformed into flower offerings. So then, finally, as the Lord Dharma of Earthly Duties, the governing god of this world challenged the right of the Blessed One to be seated there, immovable, in disregard of the good of his kingdom. Whereupon, the future Buddha only moved his right hand to touch with its fingertips the earth, when a voice was heard resounding through all the earth and sky: "0 Mara, put away thy malice. Go in peace. For never will this Great Being, whose merit has brought him to this central place, abandon his re solve." The god with his daughters and army thereupon vanished, and that night the Blessed One acquired (1) the Eye of Transcendent Vision, (2) knowledge of his Life beyond lives, and (3) comprehension of the Law of Dependent Origination, by which all beings arise in mutual dependency.



106 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
H e was now, therefore, the "Awakened One," a Buddha (from the root budh, of the verb bodhati, "he awakes") , and for the next fifty years he remained awakened in the world as a teacher of the mystic way. 20 One is struck, in reviewing this legend, by the exact coincidence of the names of the Buddha's antagonist with the motivations by which, in Joyce's view, an artist is turned from the "proper" way of his art-namely (1) Kama ("desire") , (2) Mara ("death"; which is to say, the "fear of death") , and (3) Dharma ("social duties, virtues, and commitments") . Significant, also, is the idea of the Immovable Spot, upon which the future Buddha took his seat to pursue his aim. This corresponds to Black Elk's "center of the world," which is everywhere and from which he viewed "in a sacred manner" all things. It is not a geographical place, but the state of mind of one released from the vortex of delusory desires, fears, and commitments by which lives in this world are compelled to their sorrows and pains. In the words of T. S. Eliot's " Burnt Norton":
At the still point o f the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless; Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is, But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity, Where the past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards, Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point, There would be no dance, and there is only the dance. I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where. And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time. The inner freedom from the practical desire, The release from action and suffering, release from the inner And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving . . . 21
It is there, which is no "where, " that the Eye opens of Transcendent Vision, which in the way of art is of that instant (once again to quote James Joyce) "wherein that supreme qualiry of beauty, the dear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been ar rested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony . . . the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure." 22 In India, the attainment of this state ofmind is the classic aim of yoga.

Variously described, it is known finally as Nirvii1Ja, which is not to be con ceived of, like Heaven, as a place, but as a dying out in the heart ofthe three fold fire of raga, doia, and moha ("passion," "hatred," and "delusion") . For the word vii means "to blow"; nir-vii, "to extinguish, to blow out," and ac cordingly, nir-Vii1Ja means, literally, "blown out, gone out, disappeared. " What has been "blown out" ? In relation to the idea of reincarnation, what has been "blown out" is the impulse and need to be born again; so that in this sense one may say that life (as future life) has been blown out. However, in relation to the present incarnation, it has not been life, but desire, loathing or fear, and the ignorance or delusion that they inspire and repre sent, which have been blown out. And since these, as we have found, are ex actly the kinetic traits that Joyce identifies with improper art, whereas proper art is of the static state of the mind and eye that have been "arrested and raised above" these conditioning factors by which vision is prejudiced and actuality overshaded, it follows that the way of the mystic and the way of the "proper" artist are indeed related. In fact, in the Orient they are identical, except that the mystic doesn't have a craft. For, as Ananda K. Coomaraswamy has stated in one ofhis nu merous treatments of this subject: "the practice of art [in India] is a disci pline (yoga) beginning with attention (dhara1Ja), consummated in self-identification (samiidhi), viz. with the object or theme of contempla tion, and eventuating in skill of operation (kauiala). " 23 Assumed from the beginning is the metaphysical principle announced already in the Chhandogya Upani�ad (c. ninth century B.c.) , "thou art that" (tat tvam asi), which is to say, thou art, in truth, a form of that same transcendent consciousness of which all phenomena, physical as well as psychical, are forms. Consequently, as Heinrich Zimmer observed in his first master work, Kunstform und Yoga im indischen Kultbild (Berlin, 1926) , which is now at last available in English: "For Indian art, man is god, and art is cre ated so that he might experience this truth and need art no longer. . . . Its raison d ' etre lies in the fact that it points beyond itself: it can appear as essence only to someone limited by Ignorance (avidyii), Not-yet enlightened (a-pra-buddha}: 'For the Brahmin versed in sacrifice and the Vedic texts, God is in fire; for the worshiper, in his own heart; for the Not-yet-enlightened, in the sacred image; but for him who is aware of the highest Self, God is in All Things."' 24

Emphatically, therefore, the accent i n Indian art i s not upon the welter of images before one's eyes, but on the background of an unseen power (brahman) or void {funyalii), over which they dance. For they are of the delusive veil of miiyii, magical apparitions, bursting as foam from the break ing waves of a cosmic sea, which in its depth is still. There is among the surviving documents of early-medieval India's golden Gupta age of literature and art (fourth to sixth centuries A.D.) , a work on dramaturgy, the Dafaritpa, of Dhanarpjaya, 25 in which the aim of the dramatic art is described as the communication of "enjoyment" (sviida) by rendering "sentiments, tastes, or flavors" {rasa), there being five kinds of "enjoyment" and nine "sentiments" or "flavors." "As for any simple man of little intelligence," we read at the opening of this work, "who says that from dramas which distill joy, the gain is knowledge only, as in the case of history and the like, homage to him, for he has averted his face from what is delightful. " 26 "Whether one take a subject that is delightful or disgust ing, exalted or lowly, cruel or kindly, obscure (as in the original story) or adapted (to be more intelligible) , or whether one take a subject originated by the imagination of a poet, there is no subject that cannot succeed in conveying Sentiment {rasa) among mankind." 27 Rasa, then, is the effectual agent of this art, the word meaning, literally, "sap or j uice, nectar, liquid, water, drink"; metaphorically, "essence"; and in relation to works of art, "beauty." The nine rasas named in the Dafaritpa as pertaining to the drama have been assigned as follows to the five sviidas, or " enj oyments . "
I. Cheerfulness
The Erotic and the Comic
II. Exaltation
The Heroic and the Marvelous
III. Agitation
The Odious and the Terrible
IV. Perturbation of Mind

The last is not, like the others, to be separately developed in distinct compositions, but to underlie the experiences of all as a kind of drone, or ground, over which they play. It is an experience of the "permanent state" (fthiiyin-bhiiva) known as siima ("peace of mind") , which is characterized by "tranquility, indifference to the objects of sense, and repose in the knowledge of brahman." 28 Of the sviidas, the closest to the Greek idea of tragedy is number IV. "Perturbation of Mind," as represented in dramas of the furious (raudra) and pathetic (karu1Ja) sentiments. Raudra ("wrathful, violent, terrible") is a term affiliated with the name Rudra ("Howling, Roaring") of the Vedic god of storms, who became in later thought associated with Siva as Destroyer. But Siva, we have seen, is the Indian counterpart of Dionysos, patron god of the Greek tragedy (pages 90-91) . So that the term corre sponds in sense about as closely as could be wished to Joyce's under standing of Aristotle's "tragic terror"; while karu1Ja, "that which causes pity" (pity or compassion, karu1Jii), corresponds to "tragic pity. " The Dafariipa is of a date nearly a thousand years later than Aristotle's Poetics, and that there was a massive classical influence upon Gupta thought and art cannot be doubted. 29 However, that the means must have greatly dif fered by which pity and terror were communicated in ancient Greece and medieval India, I can testify, as having witnessed in New Delhi a pro duction of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, where the audience was rather ap palled than enchanted by the carnality of the plot and characterizations; for there is nothing of the fairy tale about the atmosphere of a G reek tragedy, no sense of the play of miiyii to disengage the reality of the char acters from their histories. There is no subliminal ground of repose in brahman, over which the passions, limitations, and catastrophes of the action play, like the figurations of a dream. The release in a G reek tragedy comes, rather, at the end of the piece, in the minds of the audi ence, as a transformation of perspective. Indian dramas of Type Number I, affording "Cheerfulness" through enjoyment of the Erotic (fringiira) and Comic (hiisya) sentiments, are best represented in the poet Kalidasa's classic masterpiece, Sakuntalii Recognized (Abhijfiiinafakuntalii), which in 1789 appeared in English as the first work of Sanskrit dramatic writing translated into any Western tongue; of which Goethe then wrote the oft-quoted lines:



no Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Sp a c e
I f you wish the blossom o f the early and fruit o f the late years, Wish what is charming and exciting, as well as nourishing and sub stan tial . Wish to capture in one name heaven and earth: I name for you, Shakuntala, and all is said. 3°
In keeping with the classic prescriptions of this art, the source of de light in Kalidasa's play is of a single archetypal, or "Permanent State" (Jthiiyin-bhiiva), which is maintained without interference throughout, in flected through modifications, balanced by a supporting, secondary state, and illustrated in every situation. The "permanent state" in this case is "love" (rati), which appears, not only as the infatuation of a king in a young woman of high birth discovered in a forest hermitage, but also as Sakuntala's love for the forest and its creatures, and of the animals for the gentle girl; of the king for his subjects and the people for their king; wor shipers for their deity and the order of nature itself for its children of goodwill. Love saturates the atmosphere, gracefully complemented by the secondary permanent state of Mirth (hiisa). And the plot is, of course, of Infatuation, Separation, and Reunion. As summarized in the Dafariipa: "Just as a verb . . . when combined with nouns relating to it, is the essence of a sentence, so a Permanent State, when combined with nouns relating to it, is the essence of a sentence, so a Permanent State, when combined with other states, is the essence of a play." 31 Type Number II of dramatic enjoyment, "Exaltation" derived from plays of the Heroic (vira) and Marvelous (adbhuta) sentiments, medieval Europe knew in its Germanic and Celtic epics, out of which Wagner drew the matter of his Ring des Nibelungen (1853-74) and Parsifal (1882) . The Sanskrit term, vira ("mighty, brave, heroic"; also, "warrior, champion, hero") is related, both etymologically and in meaning, to English "virile" (Latin virilis, "manly," and vir, "adult male" ; compare Old High German wer and Old Irish fer). The word "virtue" (Latin virtus) was also of this family in its earlier sense of "excellence" of any kind, "capacity" or "power" to effect results, which is to say, in its earlier, heroic sense. With the later shift in the understanding of "virtue" to "conformity to a Christian moral code," which Nietzsche discussed in his Genealogy ofMorals (1887) , the heroic arts lost favor in the West (last stand in Cervantes's Don Quixote,



Th e Way of A rt III
early sixteenth century) and have survived only in the reflected way of the romantic nostalgia (as in Wagner) for an age of incredible deeds in a fabu lous past. The Sanskrit term adbhuta ("marvelous, surprising, supernatural, transcendental") lets us know that the deeds were not to have been taken literally, but poetically, as metaphorical of powers to be cherished of the human spirit. But even as metaphor, they are no longer positively regarded. In fact, we in America have a literature even of the anti-hero, best repre sented, and most "marvelously" (adbhuta), 1918-I940, in Charlie Chaplin. Finally, Enjoyment Type Number III. "Agitation," of the "Odious" (bzbhatsa) and "Terrible" (bhayiinaka) sentiments, would seem to represent the Indian state of mind most closely related to that of not a little of the modern arts. The meanings of the two Sanskrit terms, bibhatsa, "loath some, nauseous, hideous, detestable"; also, "cruel, envious, and wicked," and then, bhayiinaka, "fearsome, frightful, terrible, horrible, terrific," set the intended sentiments distinctly apart from those of Type IV, the Furious (raudra) and the Pathetic (karur,za}, since, in the first place, there is nothing here of compassion (karur,zii}, while in the second place, whereas the term raudra suggests the "fury and anger" of a raging god (namely, Rudra, Siva in his terrific aspect) , the term bhayiinaka is of the "permanent state," not of "wrath" (krodha), but of "fear" (bhaya). So that the two states represented are, respectively, of "disgust" (jugupsii} and "fear" (bhaya), which brings us dangerously close to Joyce's definition of improper art except that in this art there is no didacticism. The aim is not "knowledge or the like," but "enjoyment," and the sentiments rendered are of perma nent states, not to be corrected, but to be experienced. Moreover, in Indian art there is always an intended connotation to be recognized of immanent divinity. As stated in the Bhagavad Gita by ��l).a (Krishna) , the teaching incarnation of Vi�l).U the Preserver: "The one, yoked in yoga, viewing alike all beings, discerns the Self in all, and all be ings in the Self. When he thus perceives me in everything and everything in me, I shall not be lost to him, nor will he be lost to me. " 32 So that, fi nally, all rests well, all struggle and all conflict, in God, the Lord. That is the Enjoyment Type Number V. "Happiness in Tranquility," which, as already noted, is not separately developed in distinct composi tions, but underlies all as a kind of drone over which they play. Its "per manent state" is siima, "peace of mind," which is characterized by



112 Th e In n e r Reach es of O u te r Sp ace
"tranquility, indifference to the objects of sense, and repose in the knowl edge of brahman, "while the "sentiment," or rasa, by which the realization is flavored is the "peaceful" (santa-rasa), the experience of which is an ef fect simply of the harmonious composition of the work of art: what Joyce would have called its " rhythm of beauty," consonantia, its relation of part to part, of each part to the whole, and of the whole to each of its parts. Set apart, within its own frame, from the general context of phenomenality (integritas), the composed drama, dance, or epic tale is viewed in the con texture of its own harmonius arrangement (consonantia), where it is recog nized by the rasika (the appreciator of rasa, the viewer, the connoisseur) a priori, as a revelation of that Self, which, as we have learned from the Gitii, is the Self (atman-brahman) of all beings. So that Joyce's quidditas, or "whatness" of the object of art (see page 101) , is exactly, in Indian terms, brahman, and the "radiance" or claritas of which he writes as being the oc casion of esthetic arrest is santa-rasa, the "flavor, taste, or sentiment" of rest in the recognition of brahman. Moreover, no matter what the subject mat ter, when viewed with the eye of vision cleared of deluding desires and fears, this recognition of the radiance will occur. For again, as told in the Gita: "Whether upon a brahmin graced with learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, dog, or even an eater of dogs, the enlightened will look with equal eye. " 33 The way of the mystic and the way of the artist are related, except that (like Hairy, in the legend of "The Humbling of Indra") the mystic may come to regard the world with indifference, or even disdain. In the litera ture of asceticism passages abound of disparagement of the body, its func tions and its motivations. A leading disciple of Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) , when on the point of death was heard to mut ter, "I spit out the body. " Whereas the artist who has been held by his craft in love to the world as it is, regarding wi;:h equal eye the brahmin, the dog, the eater of dogs, the slayer and the slain, cannot but recognize in each whether in fascinated esthetic arrest, in pity (shared suffering) , or sheer ter ror-something of himself. As Nathaniel Hawthorne declares in his short story, "Fancy's Show Box," telling of what dreams and fancies show of the innermost truth of each: "Man shall not disclaim his brotherhood, even with the guiltiest. " 34 There have been lately, however, a number of Western artists who



Th e Way ofA rt II3
have found such indifference to social evaluations reprehensible. I think, for example, of Thomas Mann, who, both in Doctor Faustus and in Felix Krull two major works of his later years, describes the professional artist as a morally suspect, even socially dangerous, con man, who from a deliber ately chosen position of spiritual alienation, yet offers the ambiguous, self-serving products of his art, in expectation not only of support and re muneration, but also of social approval and even adoration as a genius. Mann's argument here follows and develops that of Nietzsche contra Wagner; 35 also, Freud's psychoanalytic interpretation of art as a pathologi cal symptom. In Freud's own words:
There is a means of return from fantasy to reality, and that is art. To begin with, the artist is an introvert, almost a neurotic. Constrained by abnormally strong impulses, he desires honor, power, wealth, fame, and the love of women; but he lacks the means to attain these satisfactions, and so, like any other unsatisfied person, turns away from reality and transfers all of his interest, together with his libido, to the wishful fantasies of his imagination, through which he may be carried actually to neurosis. Several factors must coincide if he is not to follow this course to its conclusion. In fact, it is well known how frequently artists suffer partial impairment of their powers through neurotic applications. Their constitution probably includes a strong capacity for sublimation along with a certain degree of laxity in the repressions decisive for a conflict. The artist finds the road back to re ality, however, in the following way. He is, of course, not the only one living a life of fantasy. The realm of fantasy is in fact a generally patronized resort, to which every sufferer from disappointments turns for refreshment and consolation. Those who are not artists are extremely limited, however, in their ability to derive pleasure from the wells of fantasy. The ruthlessness of their repressions compels them to make do with whatever meager daydreams they may dare to allow to become conscious. The genuine artist has more at his disposal. In the first place, he knows how to re work his daydreams in such a way that everything too personal, such as others might find offensive, is eliminated, and they become thus generally enjoyable. He knows, also, how to modify them, so that their origin in the forbidden wells is not immediately betrayed. And he possesses, further, the mysterious ability to shape some particular



114 Th e In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Space
material into a likeness of the model drawn from his fantasy. And fi nally, he knows how to render so much pleasure through these figu rations from his unconscious that repressions are for the moment overcome and dispelled. The one who can achieve all this, thus mak ing it possible for others to derive again refreshment and consolation from those wellsprings of their own unconscious which had become for them inaccessible, gains their thanks and admiration, and he has thus won through his fantasy what he had originally achieved only in his fantasy; namely, honor, power, and the love of women. 36
The question finally at issue, however, is not of individual psychology, alienation, and resentment, but of the irreducible conflict of metaphysics vis-a-vis morals within the j urisdiction, not only of art, but of myth, reli gion, and social action as well. For during the course of the nineteenth cen tury, the separation of these two opposed orders of human experience, concern, and fulfillment became in the West exaggerated to such a degree by the radical materialism of the increasingly industrialized megalopolitan centers of mass intelligence and democratization, that anything like the functional grounding of a social order in a mythology (so that individuals of whatever social class, participating in the metaphorical festivals, should become joined with all in a profoundly shared experience of the ground and sense of their lives) simply disappeared into irrelevance. And with that, the proper artist lost his public function. Today's pitiful contracts to invent monuments commemorating local-historical events and personages are hardly comparable to the earlier challenges of art, to break windows through the walls of the culture to eternity. Thus, the only true service of a proper artist today will have to be to individuals: reattuning them to for gotten archetypes, les grandes /ignes de Ia nature, which have been lost to view behind a cloud of contending Jeremy Benthamoid philosophies of the "greatest [economic] good of the greatest number. " Thomas Mann, himself, in his early novelette Tonio Kroger (published 1903, when Joyce was at work on A Portrait ofthe Artist As a Young Man), described the quandary of a late-nineteenth-century young artist striving to find his way in art between the apparently contrary claims of morality and metaphysics, or as Mann termed them, nature and spirit. His title charac ter, Tonio, having joined for a time an intensely intellectual company of



Th e Way ofA rt II5
bohemians in Munich, presently found their assumed superiority to the rest of mankind intolerable and, deserting them, mailed back an elaborate letter in which the nuclear idea was announced of an esthetic theory that became, in fact, the motivating inspiration of the art of Thomas Mann to the end of his career. "I marvel at those cold, proud beings," Tonio wrote, "who adventure the ways of demonic, grandiose beauty and despise 'mankind.' But I do not envy them. For if there is anything that can make of a literary man a poet, surely it is this, my home-town love for the human, the living, and the or dinary. All warmth derives from this love, all kindness and all humor. Indeed, to me it even seems that this must be that love of which it is writ ten that one may speak with the tongues of men and of angels, yet lacking it, be as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals." 37 Some twenty years later, in response to a criticism of the apparent cru elty of his own verbal characterizations, Mann elucidated further what he had begun to call the "erotic" or "plastic irony" of his art: its dual loyalty to nature and to the spirit, to love and to truth. And here, in defense of himself, he came very close indeed to justifying in psychological terms the very qualities that in his novelette he had condemned and which in his later years he would again condemn. "The right word wounds," he wrote:
The only weapon that has been given the sensibility of the artist, with which to react on appearances and experiences, defending him in the way of beauty, is this, of expressed delineation: which reaction (to use a radically psychological turn of speech) affords him a sublime revenge on the experience; the more vehement, the more refined the sensibil ity touched by the observation. Here is the source of that cold, inex orable precision in designation; here, the quivering, drawn bow from which the word flies-the sharp, feathered word, which hums and strikes and sits trembling on its mark. For is not the stem bow, as well as the gentle lyre, an instrument of Apollo? Nothing could be further removed from the truth of art than the notion that coldness and passion exclude each other: no misunderstanding greater, than to conclude from the critical accuracy of a statement that its inspiration, in the human sense, was of hostil ity and malice. 38



u6 Th e In n e r Rea ch es of O u te r Spa c e
"All life i s sorrowful!" Thus the First Noble Truth o f the Buddha. The aim of the quivering, drawn bow, therefore, the intended target of the feathered word, is but one feature of a context in which the artist himself participates, and the force that carries the arrow to its mark is compassion. The arrow, furthermore, is not the artist's own, but a gift to him, of which he is the responsible agent, a gift to him of the spirit, which is in love with the productions of time. "The poet, " Mann wrote, continuing his argument, "who does not offer himself up entirely is a useless drudge. . . . But how can I offer myself without at the same time giving up the world, which is my 'idea' (meine Vorstellung), my way of knowing, my agony, my dream?" 39 During the years of the nightmare of the "war to end wars," World War I, while Joyce was at work in peace in Switzerland on Ulysses, Mann was laboring within beleaguered Germany on a volume of soul-searching political ruminations, Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen ("Observations of a Nonpolitical Man") , 4° wherein the most conscientious analyses were un dertaken of the relative values for humanity of those same contending monster-states that were then sacrificing to their common God the youth, the manhood, and the civilization of the Continent. Instead of disengag ing his mind from judgment and regarding with equal eye the brahmin, the cow, the dog, and the eater of dogs, Thomas Mann, as a "Good European, " was applying his whole soul to a thoroughgoing examination of the contemporary European conscience. Whereas Joyce, already in A Portrait ofthe Artist As a Young Man, had cut himself off completely from the values of his culture. ''Non serviam, " he had quoted proudly, using a phrase attributed to Lucifer in his defiance of God, his Creator. "I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church." 41 Moreover, compassion, as we learn from The Tibetan Book ofthe Dead, is of two orders: compassion with, and compassion without attachment. 42 The latter is of the Buddha and conduces to enlightenment, whereas the former leads to rebirth among the Hungry Ghosts. For the judgmental (didactic) eye, whether of negation or of partici pation, is governed by a very different order of shared suffering and love than the eye at the top of the pyramid, which is of God (see pages 9 5-97) , the God that is without and within; for whom, as we hear from Heraclitus



Th e Way of A rt II?
(c. 540-480 B.c.) , "all things are fair and good and right; but men hold some things wrong and some right. " 43 "Judge not, that you may not be judged," we are cautioned in the Gospels (Matthew 7:11; Luke 6:37) ; and again, in St. Paul's letter to his congregation in Rome: " God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all" (Romans 11:32) . James Joyce in Finnegans Wake made this last statement the motto of his novel, seeding through every chapter of the enigmatic book covert ref erences to Paul's paradox by repeating ad infinitum, through innumerable transformations, the clewing number, 1132: 44 as a date (pages 13, 14, 119, and 420) , the time of day (page 70) , as the number of a legal document (page 61) , of a musical composition (page 73) , a street address (page 274) , a registered patent (page 310) , and so on and on and on (passim), giving point to this unrelenting reference to the spiritual message by casting as the leading character of the culminating masterwork of his life, upon which he labored for no less than eighteen years (1922-1939) , a Dublin Englishman of the heritage of Cromwell. "To my soul's satisfaction," Mann wrote in his scrupulous journal of World War I, "I find nothing in German history to compare with England's treatment of Ireland." 45 Economic and military imperialism, colonialism, and hypocritical democracy through centuries, Mann identified as the legacy of Great Britain, with the USA on the same course. Yet, twenty years later, in a political tract composed while touring the United States to urge this country into World War II: "Can it be denied," Mann asked rhetori cally, "that the world, in so far as it is English, finds itself in right good hands?" 46 Ironically, a leading American author, Ezra Pound, was at that time in Italy, broadcasting condemnations of the Western Alliance that were very much like those of Mann's World War I Betrachtungen. Strindberg, I believe it was, who once said: "Politicians are one-eyed cats." The right eye, the left eye. Or one can close first one, then the other eye. But the artist sees with two eyes, and alone to him is the center re vealed: that still point, as Eliot saw, where the dance is. "And there is only the dance." 47 So that, finally, it must be asked: "How far does one's mercy reach" (Romans 11:32) ? For only so far do the inner and the outer worlds meet. And just so far is the reach of one's art. As the Californian, Robinson Jeffers, states in his poem "Natural Music" :



n8 The In n e r Rea ches of O u te r Spa c e
The old voice o f the ocean, the bird-chatter o f little rivers, {Winter has given them gold for silver To stain their water and bladed green for brown to line their banks) From different throats intone one language. So I believe if we were strong enough to listen without Divisions of desire and terror To the storm of the sick nations, the rage of the hunger-smitten cities, Those voices also would be found Clean as a child's; or like some girl's breathing who dances alone By the ocean shore, dreaming of lovers. 48

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
J O SEPH CAM P B ELL was an American author and teacher best known for his work in the field of comparative mythology. He was born in New York City in 1904, and from early childhood he became interested in mythology. He loved to read books about American Indian cultures, and frequently vis ited the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where he was fascinated by the museum's collection of totem poles. Campbell was edu cated at Columbia University, where he specialized in medieval literature and, after earning a master's degree, continued his studies at universities in Paris and Munich. While abroad he was influenced by the art of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, the novels of James Joyce and Thomas Mann, and the psychological studies of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. These en counters led to Campbell's theory that all myths and epics are linked in the human psyche, and that they are cultural manifestations of the universal need to explain social, cosmological, and spiritual realities. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, and then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years. During the 1940s and '50s, he helped Swami

Nikhilananda to translate the Upani¥Uls and The Gospel ofSri Ramakrishna. He also edited works by the German scholar Heinrich Zimmer on Indian art, myths, and philosophy. In 1944, with Henry Morton Robinson, Campbell published A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wilke. His first original work, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, came out in 1949 and was immediately well received; in time, it became acclaimed as a classic. In this study of the "myth of the hero," Campbell asserted that there is a single pattern of heroic journey and that all cultures share this essential pattern in their various heroic myths. In his book he also outlined the basic conditions, stages, and results of the ar chetypal hero's journey. Joseph Campbell died in 1987. In 1988, a series of television interviews with Bill Moyers, The Power ofMyth, introduced Campbell's views to mil lions of people.
