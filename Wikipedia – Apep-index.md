Apep (/ˈæˌpɛp/ or /ˈɑːˌpɛp/; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) or Apophis (/ˈæpəfɪs/; Ancient
Greek: Ἄποφις) was the ancient Egyptian deity who embodied chaos (ı͗zft in Egyptian)
and was thus the opponent of light and Ma'at (order/truth). He appears in art as a giant
serpent. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāp(ī), as it was written
pp(y) and survived in later Coptic as Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ Aphōph.[1] Apep was first mentioned in the
Eighth Dynasty, and he was honored in the names of the Fourteenth Dynasty king
'Apepi and of the Greater Hyksos king Apophis.

Apep
in hieroglyphs
Ra was the solar deity, bringer of light, and thus the upholder of Ma'at. Apep was
viewed as the greatest enemy of Ra, and thus was given the title Enemy of Ra, and
also "the Lord of Chaos".
As the personification of all that was evil, Apep was seen as a giant snake or serpent
leading to such titles as Serpent from the Nile and Evil Lizard. Some elaborations said
that he stretched 16 yards in length and had a head made of flint. Already on a Naqada
I (ca. 4000 BC) C-ware bowl (now in Cairo) a snake was painted on the inside rim com
bined with other desert and aquatic animals as a possible enemy of a deity, possibly a
solar deity, who is invisibly hunting in a big rowing vessel.[3]
Also, comparable hostile snakes as enemies of the sun god existed under other names
(in the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts) already before the name Apep occurred. The
etymology of his name (pp) is perhaps to be sought in some west-semitic language
where a word root pp meaning 'to slither' existed. A verb root pp does at any rate
not exist elsewhere in Ancient Egyptian. (It is not to be confused with the verb pı/͗ pp:
'to fly across the sky, to travel') Apep's name much later came to be falsely connected
etymologically in Egyptian with a different root meaning (he who was) spat out; the Ro
mans referred to Apep by this translation of his name. Apophis was a large golden
snake known to be miles long. While in most texts he is described as a giant snake, he
is sometimes depicted as a crocodile.[4]
The few descriptions of Apep's origin in myth usually demonstrate that it was born af
ter Ra, usually from his umbilical cord. Combined with its absence from Egyptian cre
ation myths, this has been interpreted as suggesting that Apep wasn't a primordial
force in Egyptian theology, but a consequence of Ra's birth. This suggests that evil in
Egyptian theology is the consequence of an individual's own struggles against non-ex



istence.[5]

Tales of Apep's battles against Ra were elaborated during the New Kingdom.[7] Story
tellers said that every day Apep must lie just below the horizon. This appropriately
made him a part of the underworld. In some stories Apep waited for Ra in a western
mountain called Bakhu, where the sun set, and in others Apep lurked just before dawn,
in the Tenth region of the Night. The wide range of Apep's possible location gained him
the title World Encircler. It was thought that his terrifying roar would cause the under
world to rumble. Myths sometimes say that Apep was trapped there, because he had
been the previous chief god overthrown by Ra, or because he was evil and had been
imprisoned.
The Coffin Texts imply that Apep used a magical gaze to overwhelm Ra and his en
tourage.[8] Ra was assisted by a number of defenders who travelled with him, including
Battles with Ra



Set and possibly the Eye of Ra.[9] Apep's movements were thought to cause earth
quakes, and his battles with Set may have been meant to explain the origin of thunder
storms. In one account, Ra himself defeats Apep in the form of a cat.[10]
What few accounts there are of Apep's origin usually describe it as being born from
Ra's Umbilical cord.[5]
Ra's victory each night was thought to be ensured by the prayers of the Egyptian
priests and worshippers at temples. The Egyptians practiced a number of rituals and
superstitions that were thought to ward off Apep, and aid Ra to continue his journey
across the sky.
In an annual rite, called the Banishing of Chaos, priests would build an effigy of Apep
that was thought to contain all of the evil and darkness in Egypt, and burn it to protect
everyone from Apep's evil for another year.
The Egyptian priests had a detailed guide to fighting Apep, referred to as The Books of
Overthrowing Apep (or the Book of Apophis, in Greek).[11] The chapters described a
gradual process of dismemberment and disposal, and include:
In addition to stories about Ra's winnings, this guide had instructions for making wax
models, or small drawings, of the serpent, which would be spat on, mutilated and
burnt, whilst reciting spells that would kill Apep. Fearing that even the image of Apep
could give power to the demon, any rendering would always include another deity to

subdue the monster.
As Apep was thought to live in the underworld, he was sometimes thought of as an
Eater of Souls. Thus the dead also needed protection, so they were sometimes buried
with spells that could destroy Apep. The Book of the Dead does not frequently de
scribe occasions when Ra defeated the chaos snake explicitly called Apep. Only BD
Spells 7 and 39 can be explained as such.[12]
