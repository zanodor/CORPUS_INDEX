Preface
The Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing) is a unique and enduring record of a wide range of beliefs held by the ancient Chinese about their world, encompassing religion, mythology, geography, flora, fauna, minerals, and medicine. An encyclopedic cosmography mostly compiled from the Warring States period to the Western Han dynasty (c. 4th–c. 1st cent. b.c.e.), it has been repeatedly hand-copied, reprinted, and re-edited through the centuries into our own time. Since the nineteenth century, it has also attracted the attention of foreign scholars and in recent years has been translated into at least five di erent languages. The early Guideways may well have been illustrated, but if so, these images have all been lost, as have those known to have existed during the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song periods. The earliest surviving set of woodblock illustrations is from a rare edition dated 1597, during the late Ming dynasty, and this set is reproduced here for the first time in its entirety. The modern reader can now survey representations of some 350 gods, heroes, demons, foreign peoples, and other strange creatures from among the more than 550 that the book records. When the Guideways was edited and presented to Emperor Ming of the Western Han dynasty in 6 b.c.e., it was already regarded as a compendium of lost knowledge. Today, only a small number of these creatures are familiar to the Chinese, although the animistic and demonological worldview they represent survived throughout the country well into the twentieth century and is still embraced by some. In titling this present volume a “bestiary,” my intention is to suggest a general similarity to works from other premodern cultures in which examples of living anomalies were collected for purposes of instruction, curiosity, and delight. Strictly speaking, the Guideways di ers from the bestiaries of the late medieval period in Europe in that these strange creatures were almost never allegorically construed as vehicles of theological virtues or evils. Rather, they were regarded as actual entities found throughout the landscape. A part of the ecology within the cosmos of heaven and earth, they dwelled elusively alongside humankind, which was obliged to learn how to recognize them and to employ the appropriate strategies for coexisting with them. Preserving and transmitting such knowledge was undoubtedly one of the original purposes of the anonymous
XIII



compilers of the Guideways. It is my hope that this way of presenting a selection of its content in conjunction with these images can enable the modern English-language reader to gain a broader understanding of an important worldview in ancient China. These panoramic images, like dioramas in a Wunderkammer or natural history museum, are unique windows opening onto vistas that simulate a sacred geography filled with strikingly unusual denizens. In contrast to the better-known philosophical and historical texts that have survived from early China and mostly propound the ideological concerns of intellectuals, o‹cials, and rulers, the Guideways preserves a perspective more characteristic of the beliefs of most traditional Chinese, regardless of social level. This particular set of illustrations was designed by the artisan Jiang Yinghao (fl. late 16th cent.) and intended for a broad reading public. Though they may have been derived from earlier pictorial traditions, they predominantly reflect a later, more naturalistic style favored by many of the illustrators and commercial engravers of Jiang’s time. Jiang, who remains otherwise unknown, clearly had his imagination sparked by reading the text, with the aid of the accumulated commentaries of scholars. Despite a few anacronisms and errors of interpretation, on its own his work represents an aesthetic achievement and is a worthy representative of the art of popular book illustration in late traditional China. This volume brings together versions of this edition from two great libraries. Most of the seventy-six plates are taken from the one preserved in the National Library of China in Beijing. However, damage to parts of plates XLIII and XLIV have made it necessary to substitute these pages from another edition in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. May the restoration of these images, like the joining of two halves of a tally, serve as a symbol of the continuing process of cultural collaboration between China and the United States. In addition to many colleagues who generously shared their knowledge with me, I would like to particularly thank all those who aided me in obtaining the illustrations and helped make possible their reproduction, especially Ms. Sun Beixin, vice director, and the librarians of the Rare Book Collection, National Library of China, Beijing; Dr. Chi Wang and Mr. David Hsu, Chinese Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Mr. James Cheng, East Asian Library, U.C.L.A. and Harvard-Yenching Institute Library, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Ms. Daisy Hu and Mr. Jin Shen, Harvard-Yenching Institute Library; Ms. Amy Tsiang, East Asian Library, U.C.L.A.; Ms. Jean Han, East Asiatic Library, U.C. Berkeley; Mme. Monique Cohen, Manuscrits Orientales, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris; Ms. Frances Wood, Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, British Library, London; Mr. Charles Aylmer, Cambridge University Library, Cambridge; Mr. Martin Heidjra, Gest Oriental Library, Princeton University, as well as Professor Noel Barnard for permission to reproduce the drawings of the Chu Silk Manuscript. I should also like to thank professors Cyril Birch and Suzanne Cahill for their helpful comments on the manuscript as well as, at the University of California Press, Sheila Levine, executive editor; Sue Heinemann, project editor; Mimi Kusch, copy editor; Caralyn Bialo, editorial assistant; and Barbara Jellow, designer. The Center for Chinese Studies at UCLA also provided funds to support the drawing of the maps and the compilation of the index. Undoubtedly, as the Guideways continues to be read in an increasingly global culture, there will emerge a greater appreciation of its uniqueness, a deeper understand

ing of its content, and new solutions to its many textual problems. Some day, archaeologists may even unearth an early edition from the Warring States period that will either confirm our present knowledge or thoroughly surprise us. Until then, it is hoped that readers will experience the same degree of fascination with these strange creatures and their world that I have felt in the process of assembling this volume.

Editorial Notes
ON THE TRANSLATION
For a complete English translation of the Guideways, general readers may wish to consult the recent version by Anne Birrell (1999) despite her highly imaginative rendition of the names of places and things. Another English version by Hsiao-Chieh Cheng et al. (1985) may be useful but is also problematical in many places. Specialist readers will probably prefer the more reliable Italian version by Riccardo Fracasso (1996) or the one in French by Rémi Mathieu (1983). The latter two are sinological in style, however, with all names romanized instead according to the phonology of modern standard Mandarin. While this approach is su‹cient for the scholar, it presents two problems for nonspecialists. First, almost all Chinese graphs possess one or more meanings, and the natural tendency when reading is to register their significant references as much as possible in addition to recognizing their sounds. The names of places and things in the Guideways can be seen to fall into three categories: those that convey fairly comprehensible meanings that can often be related to the accompanying descriptions; those that register an ambiguous meaning or multiple meanings that may or may not be related to the descriptions; and those that cannot be understood with any certainty even if the graphs may function semantically in other contexts. Romanizing the names conveniently avoids the many problems that arise with translation, but, for the Englishlanguage reader, it obscures the native experience of the text by suppressing much of its imagery. Second, it is certain that the original readers and most later ones before the rise of modern standard Mandarin never pronounced these names exactly as they are romanized today due to di erences in historical phonology and dialect variations. The earliest commentator, Guo Pu, already noticed these problems in the early fourth century c.e. and sought to include his own suggestions, but it is not always clear just how accurate or helpful they are. Although the tradition of reading the text takes note of these suggestions in the absence of other aids, it has not yet been possible to locate a single origin of the text in time or place. Nor are the principles of Guo’s phonological methods always obvious: often, he merely states how a graph should be pronounced. Thus, at present there is no reliable means to recover the authentic early pronuncia

tions as they might have been spoken by an ancient Chinese during the period when the text was first compiled. Since the focus of this book is on presenting the strange creatures for English-language readers, certain compromises have been inevitable. Regarding pronunciation, I have followed contemporary Western scholarly practice by providing romanizations of all names using the pinyin system. Most are in accord with modern standard Mandarin, but in certain cases as noted, I have, like Fracasso and Mathieu, followed the suggestions of Guo Pu and later Chinese commentators. Though these are probably anachronistic, for the most part, they remain the closest indications we have. In addition, I have undertaken the risky venture of providing translations whenever possible of the names of creatures, places, and things. Though well aware of the risks involved in the more polysemous cases, I o er these translations as reasonable significations that would have occurred to traditional Chinese readers both to facilitate the reader’s contact with this di‹cult text and to stimulate further consideration among specialists of what these names might have meant. In a few cases, I have decided to follow existing translations of names in Birell (1993, 1999) and other previously published works in the hope of contributing to a common nomenclature for Chinese mythology. Nevertheless, I have refrained altogether from translating when the meaning is genuinely undecidable or nonsensical or where the graphs appear to have been solely a transliteration. To give a more concrete idea of the problems, there is a bird whose name, Qiezhi [no. 199],* can mean “stealing-fat” and a mountain, Lema [see no. 210], whose name can mean “happy-horse.” On the other hand, the creature called Conglong [no. 35], if translated, would literally be known as “Onion-Deaf,” even though it has no connection with onions or deafness. Some creatures are said to be named after the sound they make, and these can be signified either by meaningful graphs or by onomatopoetic ones. As for ambiguous cases, the graph ying in Ying River may be translated as “eminent,” “brave,” “flower,” “heroic,” “beauty,” “handsome,” and so forth. Here, I must admit that my choice may appear subjective in the absence of supporting evidence, and I o er such preferences only as hypotheses awaiting further confirmation. Classical Chinese does not always indicate whether a noun is singular or plural. In the Guideways, it is sometimes stated that many creatures of a type can be found in a place or that such a creature can be found in a number of places. In many cases, it is not certain from the text whether the creature is a type or whether it exists only as an individual. Thus, I have tended to present each creature in the singular, reserving the plural for when the text specifically indicates or clearly implies it. This book presents translations of sections of the original text relevant to the illustrations of the strange creatures in bold type. These are based on the standard edition, the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Supplementary Commentaries (Shanhaijing jianshu, 1809) by Hao Yixing, which includes Guo Pu’s commentary as well as his own. Others, such as those of Bi Yuan, Wang Fu, Wu Renchen, and Wang Chongqing, have also been consulted along with the more recent editions of Yuan Ke, Fracasso,

Mathieu, Cheng et al., and Birrell. Following the translations is additional information that I have gathered and that I hope can shed further light on these strange creatures. Considerable later material about early Chinese mythology has been preserved, though its historicity is often di‹cult to assess. I have tried to present the Guideways as both an early text and one that has continued to be read through two millennia under changing conditions of reception. Regrettably, considerations of time and space have prevented me from adding as much later material as I would have liked.
Measures
The following measures appear in the Guideways. There was considerable local variation throughout China during the premodern period as well as di erent o‹cial standards through the centuries. Those listed below are approximate equivalences based on data from the seventeenth through the nineteenth century.
1 bu B = 5 Chinese feet (chi ÿ ) or 60.5 inches 1 chi ÿ = a Chinese foot or 14.1 inches (linear), 12.1 inches (itinerary) 1 li Ω = 1/3 of a mile or 1821.15 feet 1 ren Q = 7 Chinese feet or 98.7 inches 1 xun M = 8 Chinese feet or 112.8 inches 1 zhang V = 10 Chinese feet or 141 inches 1 jin Á = 1.33 lbs. 1 shi ¤ = 160 lbs. (weight), 23.4 gallons (volume)
CHINESE DATES AND DYNASTIES
Traditional dates of reigns and events for the Xia and Shang kings and for earlier thearchs are generally indicated based on Legge’s translation of The Bamboo Annals (1966 ed.) when possible. The reader is advised, though, that these are not to be taken as accurate. Nivison has pointed out that many of the later dates are often a year late (Loewe [1993], 46). The earlier dates are not based on firm historical evidence but are provided simply to suggest how these periods and events were chronologically arranged according to one example of traditional Chinese historiography. For Chinese commentators such as Guo Pu and others up until the modern period, this chronology was sometimes relevant to their understanding of the text. Dates for the Zhou dynasty kings follow Shaughnessy in Loewe (1993), 509. Later dates follow the tables in volume 2 of Cihai (Hong Kong, 1979), Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual (Cambridge, Mass., 1998), and Loewe and Shaughnessy, eds., The Cambridge History of Ancient China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 28–29. The following are generally accepted dates for the more important dynasties and feudal states. However, the historical existence of the Xia dynasty is still a matter of scholarly debate, as are the exact dates of the Shang, the founding of the Zhou, and the origins of many of the feudal states of the Zhou.

Introduction
One day Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643 b.c.e.) was out riding beyond the city walls with his renowned prime minister, Guan Zhong (c. 730–645 b.c.e.). Suddenly, he noticed that a tiger lying in ambush had set its sights on him, but inexplicably the tiger refrained from attacking. When the duke questioned Guan Zhong about this unusual behavior, he replied that the duke’s gallant mount must have resembled a strange creature known as the Bo [nos. 82, 251].* According to the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing, c. 4th–1st cent. b.c.e.), the Bo resembles a horse with a white body, a black tail, a single horn, and the teeth and claws of a tiger.1 It is said to devour tigers and leopards. Thus, Guan explained, the tiger was probably avoiding the duke’s horse out of fear.2 This apocryphal story from the Master Guan (Guanzi, c. 5th–1st cent. b.c.e.), an encyclopedic compendium on statecraft, articulates the importance of recognizing the guaiwu, or “strange creatures,” that dwell throughout the landscape. Duke Huan, who had become legendary as the first of the five great hegemons of the Zhou dynasty, is shown displaying his control over the wild periphery. The tiger not only represents a threat to man still feared in many areas of China at that time but, symbolically, other nobles who occasionally challenged the duke’s rule. The duke’s preeminence among men is matched by his horse’s resemblance to one of the more fearsome strange creatures, and the duke’s supremacy appears only momentarily threatened before he is cleverly reassured by his prime minister. The original readers of this anecdote were mostly members of the literate elite with political ambitions as o‹cials or advisors in the courts of the feudal states. They understood Guan Zhong’s timely reply as an example of his legendary success as an o‹cial and read the story as a recommendation that they, too, equip themselves with such useful knowledge of the strange.
The graph guai was later glossed in Explanations and Analyses of Graphs (Shuowen jiezi, 100 c.e.), China’s oldest dictionary, as simply yi or “portentous anomaly,” reflecting the contemporary interest in interpreting omens in the politics of the Han dynasty.3 In earlier texts, guai more broadly denoted nonnormative, suprahuman phenomena as well as the typical psychological responses of awe and fear to such things. The cast of

strange creatures included animate figures (gods, heroes, demons, monsters, exotic animals, foreign tribes), celestial phenomena (winds, rains, rainbows, stars, comets, brilliant lights), impressive geographical formations (mountains, rocks, minerals, rivers, lakes, seas) as well as unusual flora (plants, trees, flowers). Many of the latter objects were often personified as gods and spirits. It is a characteristic of the traditional Chinese worldview that such creatures were regarded as an intimate part of the natural environment rather than as supernatural or otherworldly. Though elusive and often mobile, they might manifest themselves to people if they desired—for better or worse. In this mechanistic universe, the higher gods, like government o‹cials, were assumed to be responsive to sacrifices and entreaties, provided they were o ered under the correct ritual conditions, while demons might be exorcised with the help of charms, spells, and shamanistic mediums. Some beneficial creatures were enlisted by the culture to aid in conveying departed souls to the next world or in transporting those on spirit-journeys to heaven. Others were of medicinal value if consumed or worn as a talisman. It is possible that some ancient rulers engaged in collecting strange creatures and displayed them as a sign of royal power over the natural world. One legend in the philosophical text Master Shi (Shizi, 4th cent. b.c.e.) tells of King Yan of Xu (fl. c. 10th cent. b.c.e. or 7th cent. b.c.e.), the ruler of a feudal state in central China. He was said to have personally captured strange fish by diving underwater and to have obtained strange animals by venturing into deep mountains. He then displayed these beasts in the hall of his residence in what must have been an ancient Chinese example of the later Wunderkammer of the European Renaissance.4 Strange creatures were also much in evidence as decorations. They could be found on weapons, ritual bronze vessels, musical instruments, jewelry, textiles, household objects, co‹ns, and the walls of tombs and as tomb figurines. They were depicted as well in folk art and on murals found in temples, government buildings, and private residences. Despite such attempts to appropriate their power through visual representations, the predominant view of them was that in actuality they were largely indi erent to human concerns. If encountered, especially by travelers through the mountains, they could be unpredictable, threatening, and beyond the limits of rational understanding or control. Thus, strange phenomena were among the subjects that Confucius (551–479 b.c.e.) was said to have avoided speaking of even as he and other philosophers recognized the pervasive presence of gods and spirits and urged a properly respectful attitude toward them.5 In ancient China, the population of these strange creatures throughout the landscape was so abundant and their names, natures, and appearances so numerous that it was beyond the capacity of any individual to know every one of them. Nor were the many local deities of ancient Chinese religion fully organized into a stable, universal pantheon. O‹cial cults, ancestral worship, and the propitiation of nature gods and local spirits overlapped, while beliefs periodically underwent metamorphoses because of a variety of changing social and political circumstances. O‹cial religion was limited in its focus and practiced only by those of appropriate lineage, rank, or profession, while the majority of people regardless of their status were motivated by private concerns of personal welfare in their relations with spiritual beings.6 One can find stories in early texts in which rulers like Duke Huan must consult visitors, courtiers, scholars, o‹cial scribe-astrologers, diviners, and shamans, among others, to discover which god is caus

ing a disturbance and why. Most early Chinese beliefs about particular strange creatures remained localized and were not widely understood. Thus, people were generally dependent on a variety of figures who might happen to possess such information.7 The Guideways was probably compiled in part to fulfill the need for a reference work that could answer these and other questions about the denizens of both the Chinese and non-Chinese worlds. In its present form, it records more than 500 animate creatures in addition to some 550 mountains, 300 rivers, 95 foreign lands and tribes, 130 kinds of pharmaceuticals (to prevent some 70 illnesses), 435 plants, 90 metals and minerals, as well as specific forms of ritual sacrifice to various mountain gods, all organized within a geographical framework. It is actually composed of several books that were later stitched together by bibliographers and scholars, while each of these sections is itself an aggregate of various strata of information. So diverse is its content that readers for two millennia in China and the West have characterized it in many fashions. It has been called “a legacy of sages and worthies clearly stated in ancient graphs,”8 “an ancient geography book containing practical help for worldly projects and not just fabulous talk,”9 “the ancestor of all discussions of the strange,”10 “the oldest work of fiction,”11 “a geographic survey and folkloric compendium of the ancient world,”12 “the garden of Chinese mythology,”13 “a frightful mixtum compositum,”14 “une sorte d’encyclopédie avant la lettre,”15 “a catalog of the natural and supernatural fauna and flora,”16 “a travel guide for the upper classes,”17 “a voluminous corpus of protoscientific, magico-religious and mythological notions arranged on a cosmological ‘support’ halfway between reality and fancy,”18 and “an ancient book of the shamans.”19 Although each of these characterizations has some basis in the text, the book clearly defies ready classification. Traditionally regarded as divinely transmitted, the obvious combination of fact, unverifiable data, the fantastic, and the fabricated has fascinated, puzzled, and repelled readers for centuries. How, when, where, and by whom the Guideways was first created is obscured by legend and remains the subject of much debate among textual scholars.20 It is probably best understood today as a summary of the knowledge of certain kinds of pragmatic experts in what has been called “natural philosophy and occult thought.”21 Its linguistic style and underlying thought suggest that parts of it first took shape during the Warring States period, perhaps as early as the fourth century b.c.e., when a range of technical literature had already begun to be developed by the exponents of various schools. Though some of its content can also be found in other early texts, the loss of a great deal of the literature and oral traditions of this period over the centuries makes it di‹cult to identify its prototypes or to compare it to other works of its genre known to have existed. Nevertheless, it is possible to consider its origins by reflecting on the common beliefs of early China, the kinds of governmental activity that required such information, and the intellectual milieu that gave rise to this and other encyclopedic visions of the world.
ORIGINS OF THE GUIDEWAYS
It was a supreme god-king of antiquity or thearch who was among those credited in mythology with disseminating knowledge of strange creatures among the population.
INTRODUCTION 3



Yu the Great (trad. r. 1989–1981 b.c.e. [no. 345]) was later historicized and regarded as the progenitor of China’s first dynasty, the Xia.22 He had been chosen for his virtue by his predecessors, the thearchs Yao (trad. r. 2145–2046 b.c.e.) and Shun (trad. r. 2042–1993 b.c.e.), and empowered to travel throughout the known world to quell the Deluge. He was also credited with establishing a national order by dividing the land into nine provinces and five dependencies as well as facilitating the circulation of local products and tribute to the court. Yu was thus regarded as the divine fountainhead of knowledge about the geography of the natural world as well as a model ruler who brought it and its denizens under control. In a myth dated 606 b.c.e. in Zuo’s Narratives to the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu zuozhuan, c. late 4th cent. b.c.e.), Yu is cast as an early culture hero:
In the past when the Xia dynasty still possessed virtue, the distant lands presented images of their strange creatures and the heads of the nine provinces contributed bronze so that vessels were cast which illustrated these creatures. Every kind of strange creature was completely depicted in order that the common people would know the gods and the demons. Thus, when people went to the rivers, lakes, mountains, and forests, they did not encounter these adverse beings nor did the Chimei-Hobgoblins [see no. 287] in the hills and the Wangliang-Goblins in the waters accost them. As a result, harmony was maintained between those above and those dwelling on Earth below while everywhere, the people received the protection of Heaven.23
In the historical tradition, Yu’s Nine Bronze Vessels also became a symbol of political legitimacy and were later said to have been passed down among rulers through the Shang and Zhou dynasties until they disappeared sometime during the Qin. Although the vessels have remained an enduring artistic motif (fig. 1) of a united Chinese polity, no archaeological evidence has yet surfaced to confirm their existence. And it seems unlikely to, judging from the simplicity of the bronze vessels uncovered from the Erlitou period, which some scholars consider the Xia. The stories of their later disappearance, moreover, imply that humankind in general reverted to greater ignorance about strange creatures than they did during the golden age of Yu.24 Yu the Great has traditionally been credited with the origin of the Guideways as well as other early cosmographies. Almost every major editor and commentator before the modern period considered him to be the creator of the text, either singly or in conjunction with his o‹cials Yi and/or Boyi (fl. c. 2000 b.c.e. [no. 345]), who are said to have accompanied him on his epic travels.25 Internal evidence alone would dispute this, but given Yu the Great’s lofty cultural status, ascribing the book to him or his o‹cials was a characteristic way of creating authority for the text. Such a genealogy must have also signified the primary professional community that served as a source of much of its earliest information just as the Ru-Confucian school traced the origins of many canonical works to Confucius himself or the yi-physicians credited Divine Farmer (Shennong) and the Yellow Thearch (Huangdi, both trad. c. 3rd millennium b.c.e.) with having written important medical and pharmacological treatises. Yu appears to have been particularly revered by mediums, shamans, and other occult practitioners,

some of whom performed a magical dance known as the “Paces of Yu” used to protect travelers as well as to exorcise demons as early as the Warring States period.26 The modern writer and literary scholar Lu Xun (1881–1936) suggested in the early 1920s that the Guideways originated with the shamans of early China, a view recently elaborated by the contemporary mythologist and commentator Yuan Ke (1916–).27 It certainly presents a worldview reflecting animistic and demonological beliefs about strange creatures that are often expressed mythologically in a style that utilizes repetitive formulae designed to magically name and enumerate elements of the natural world. Some of its content can be traced back to Shang-dynasty beliefs, and some may even predate this period. Moreover, the Guideways appears closely related in some of its religious concerns to the genre of daybooks only recently discovered by archaeologists. These early guides and almanacs addressed popular concerns such as choosing auspicious days for travel and avoiding danger from gods and demons.28 Thus, Lu Xun’s instinctive assessment may well point to the Guideways’ most distant origins, for when this book is more closely scrutinized, not only are shamans themselves found to be recorded to a greater extent than in any other surviving writing from early China but the range of their expertise in antiquity is probably consistent with much of the book’s content.

Most scholars today a‹rm that the cultures of the many local Chinese ethnicities in antiquity were probably shamanistic in nature and that shamanism was either identical with kingship or closely allied with political authority. In some of the more than 150,000 oracle-bone inscriptions from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200–1045 b.c.e.), the earliest examples of extended Chinese writing, a form of the graph now read as wu appears in connection with the divinations of the royal house. This is generally believed to have denoted people with special vision who possessed various techniques of communicating with spiritual beings. The names of a few individuals such as Shaman Xian [see no. 235] have been recorded, but the evidence from this period is still too sparse to precisely indicate their social identity or the full range of their activities. During the ensuing Zhou dynasty, however, it is clear from texts that among the many skills attributed to the wu were spirit-journeying and the invocation of gods through ecstatic trance, thus justifying to some extent the conventional identification of them as “shamans.”29 Despite their presence at the Shang court and later indications that they have generally played a distinct role in local cultures until the modern period, the wu-shamans were largely ignored by the literary traditions of the Eastern Zhou philosophers, historians, and other intellectuals who were in competition with them for aristocratic patronage. Hence, the portrait of them that can be constructed is often a fragmented one with largely negative overtones. Further confusion is created by the lack of an inclusive name for the many other varieties of occult practitioners in ancient China and by the anachronistic application of such designations by writers of later times. It is not even clear what these people looked like, although some modern scholars believe that painted figures on a zither excavated from a Warring States tomb in the state of Chu may be depictions of wu-shamans engaged in various ritual activities (fig. 2). The most detailed description of their o‹cial religious functions emerged in the course of a purported conversation between King Zhao of Chu (r. 515–489 b.c.e.) and his o‹cial Guan Yifu (n.d.) recorded in the Conversations from the Feudal States (Guoyu, late 5th–4th cent. b.c.e.). Guan stated:
In antiquity, humans and gods did not maintain direct contact. Those among the people whose essential spirit was capable of absolute concentration and who were, moreover, reverential and serious, whose awareness could correctly distinguish the signs of the realms above and below, whose divine sagacity enabled them to penetrate that which is distant, whose luminous discernment was capable of comprehending this, and whose perception was able to achieve a deep understanding of it—into such people did the gods descend. The men were known as “xi” and the women, as “wu.” It is they who were charged with determining the dwellingplaces of the gods, the proper positions in sacrificial rituals, and the hierarchical order among them so that the descendants of the ancient divine ones would be blessed. They also knew the names and locations of the important mountains and rivers, the ancestors of the ruling house, the management of the a airs of its ancestral temple, as well as the family lineage generation by generation. . . . Thus, the gods bestowed benefits while the people o ered up sacrifices for them to enjoy. Disasters were averted and there was nothing that the people were in want of.30
6 INTRODUCTION



Guan went on to note the various government positions occupied by wu-shamans, indicating that some of them not only played a role in o‹cial cults but were also incorporated into the political structure. There was undoubtedly much diversity in the styles of their magical practices and beliefs, reflecting not only hierarchical di erences among them but also the considerable variations of local cultures. Little is known of their social organization, however. Their roles may have been largely, though not exclusively, hereditary, while only the names and myths about a few individuals have been preserved. Although images, charms, demonological texts, and almanacs have recently begun to be excavated from tombs, suggesting an abundant pragmatic literature at the time, no theological texts have survived that can be directly connected with them. Most of the shamans’ esoteric expertise was probably transmitted orally and only began to be written down during the Warring States period. Perhaps the wu-shamans and other occult practitioners are best defined by the range of their cultural functions. Among the things they were skilled in were herbal medicine, divination, dream interpretation, exorcism, omenology, genealogy, mythology, geography, calendrical and astronomical calculation, sacrifices, sacred performance, rainmaking, as well as certain rites of resurrection. The reader will find that practically all these elements appear in the Guideways.31 However, developments beginning in the Eastern Zhou and accelerating during the Warring States period suggest that the actual commitment of this information to an organized, written form may have been carried out in connection with others. In a centuries-long process that ultimately undermined the political authority of shamanistic culture, the power of the central Zhou court unraveled as new aristocrats and local clans assumed control in the feudal states and competed with one another for dominance. To aid the most ambitious of these rulers seeking to reunify China under their hegemony, groups of literate intellectuals arose and sought to gain patronage by advocating various schools of text-based knowledge.32 The diversity of these exponents as well as their interschool rivalry is suggested by the traditional term Hundred Schools of Philosophy, while their predominant social roots in the lower ranks of the military aris

tocracy are often signified by the term shi. Both are imprecise designations, but collectively these literate thinkers did represent a new, highly mobile class proferring a range of ideas throughout the feudal states in response to the challenges of the times. The role of the elite wu-shamans in o‹cial cults may have been tied to earlier aristocratic social structures, for they appear to have become increasingly subordinated to bureacratic ritual o‹cials and priests connected to the newly dominant families, who often arose from among the ministerial or gentry class. The latter groups sometimes adopted the gods and divine ancestors of those they displaced and usurped the exclusive rights of previous rulers to sacrifice to the important nature gods on behalf of the state, activities which the wu sometimes resisted.33 In an explosion of writing that could genuinely be called a “textual revolution,” the members of the intellectual schools disseminated systems of thought that appropriated or superseded the traditional areas of shamanistic expertise. The Mohists notably continued to champion demonological theology, but others selectively abandoned these older beliefs as new dualistic formulations such as the ethereal and earthly souls gained credence.34 Legalists such as Han Fei (c. 280–c. 233 b.c.e.) criticized the use of deity imagery in calendrical calculation. The early Daoists of the Master Zhuang (Zhuangzi, late 3rd–1st cent. b.c.e) refashioned mythology in literary fables to argue for impersonal natural laws and mystical approaches to statecraft. Later scholars of the Ru-Confucian school not only followed Confucius in distancing themselves from discussing strange phenomena, but, as in the case of Xun Qing (c. 335–c. 238 b.c.e.), they were also skeptical of those who claimed to know the workings of heaven. All these groups, as well as the author(s) of historical works such as Zuo’s Narratives, were active in selectively humanizing gods and thearchs to promote them as model political rulers.35 Beginning in the fourth century b.c.e., eclectic schools created various blends and more organized, “correlative” cosmological systems based on such archetypes as yin and yang and the Five Agents that were extended in subsequent centuries to become the most influential paradigms especially during the Qin and Han dynasties.36 Around the third century b.c.e., the fangshi-wizards gained credibility as a new, highly competitive breed of charismatic magical practitioners with an alternate cosmology of their own and more sophisticated techniques for achieving longevity.37 Even in the field of medicine long dominated by herbal and exorcistic methods, new concepts of the body and management of disease began to be practiced. The yi-physicians incorporated correlative cosmology and the flow of vital energy into a system that evolved into the “traditional Chinese medicine” known today.38 In practice, the kinds of distinctions made by new schools of philosophers did not necessarily create a sharp break between earlier beliefs and the newer forms of knowledge. Mythology and deity imagery continued to be adapted to their systems, and many of the texts transmitted by these schools actually became repositories that preserved certain shamanistic traditions. However, the e ect of committing hitherto esoteric orally transmitted knowledge to writing enabled nonspecialists among the literate elite to practice many of these techniques as well as to freely develop them in new directions. Inevitably, the prestige of elite wu-shamans eroded. By the end of the second century c.e. the Ru-Confucian school and its canon of classical texts had become established as the orthodox ideology of the imperial state. Its members, drawn largely from gentry families, filled the expanding bureaucracy of

the central government, which gradually extended its control into local areas. In the face of relentless political hostility from o‹cials, the wu were finally legally proscribed from becoming o‹cials themselves, and henceforth the government sought to confine them, though not always successfully, to a substratum of the popular culture. Finally, the new, more universalistic religions of Daoism and Buddhism, with their superior magical techniques, organized priesthoods, and sacred texts, were beginning to spread among all classes. In particular, the Celestial Masters School of Daoism absorbed many of the occult practices and directly challenged the local authority of the wu and the fangshi, who appeared increasingly unsophisticated and less e‹cacious by comparison.39 With this new reliance on texts as a basis for authority, one important genre of writing appearing during the Warring States period was the encyclopedic compilation that included the cosmography.40 These works sought to organize diverse information about the world in an e ort to define a more systematic pattern of totality as a model for a centrally unified China. Earlier works such as the Book of Changes (Yijing, c. 9th cent. b.c.e.–Han) and the Book of Songs (Shijing, c. 11th cent. b.c.e.–Han) were joined by the Government Organization of the Zhou Dynasty (Zhouli, late Warring States period), the Master Guan, The Compendium of Mr. Lü (Lüshi chunqiu, c. 239 b.c.e.), the glossary Approaching Refinement (Erya, c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.), “The Tributes of Yu” (Yugong, late Warring States), the mythical itinerary The Chronicle of King Mu (Mutianzi zhuan, Warring States–c. 4th cent. c.e.) and, later, the summary Daoist compendium Master of Huainan (Huainanzi, c. 139 b.c.e.).41 Most of these texts were clearly collective e orts by many scholars and in some cases were compiled under o‹cial sponsorship. They tended to bring together both existing texts and oral traditions, often organizing their data for handy reference by using cosmological frameworks such as numerical systems, the lunar calendar and the four seasons, and spatial structures. The Guideways, China’s earliest surviving cosmography, reflects this last tendency by being organized according to a central region surrounded by territories and seas extending in the four directions. As found in various forms in many premodern cultures, cosmographies typically blend empirical fact, hearsay, and fantasy within a geographical framework, purporting to be accurate descriptions of the world.42 They assemble a variety of disparate information inscribing prevailing assumptions about normative and anomalous phenomena and often seek to domesticate through discourse what may lie beyond the boundaries of a culture’s actual understanding or control. Cosmographies project the possibilities of a totalizing perspective by seamlessly mapping the near and the distant, the known and the unknown, the visible and the hidden, the verifiable and the imaginary. The reader willingly consumed an illusion that all the important objects of reality had been collected and ordered according to a fundamental taxonomy and that these things were now manageable and available for exploitation. Cosmographies have thus proven particularly useful as guides facilitating imperialistic expansion, since they chart strategies for encountering and successfully incorporating the foreign “other.” To later readers, they have also revealed the conceptual strategies of power that operated within the dominant culture both internally and in its foreign relations. Both o‹cial and private libraries during the Warring States period possessed various kinds of cosmographies that utilized words and probably images as well. The discourse that they employed to name and describe strange creatures undoubtedly reflected
INTRODUCTION 9



early Chinese cultural archetypes of centrality and di erence as well as more universal psychological fears of the unknown. It has been noted that the tendency in the West since the ancient Greeks has been to create evolutionary schemes that project such di erences into earlier, less civilized times or onto less technologically advanced, “primitive” peoples. The Chinese, however, attempted to manage the strange by what has been called “the systematic attempt to spatialize all the categories of ‘otherness.’ ”43 That is, fact and fantasy combined in works such as the Guideways to distribute a diverse population of strange creatures throughout a vast, sacred geography where they dwell in the eternal present of mythological time. Although historical events and genealogical sequences may be included, this kind of ordering is essentially beyond linear temporality and is subordinated to the repetitive rhythms of natural processes, myth, and ritual. These books were continually evolving as new intelligence about the world was gathered. Those used in the major feudal states must have particularly grown in scope, detail, and organization, creating totalizing visions that mirrored their political aspirations to achieve hegemony and national reunification. Certain government activities related to the necessities of statecraft also resulted in the production of written data, some of which found its way into the Guideways. Metal, especially copper, was increasingly necessary for the weapons needed by the massive armies of the Warring States. The Master Guan urged rulers to survey mountains, take note of those that yielded valuable metals, and even proscribe the common people from trespassing—on pain of death.44 A more detailed description of the bureacratic organization of the landscape for military purposes including the measurement of distances can be seen from a passage in Zuo’s Narratives, dated 548 b.c.e.:
Wei Yan was made marshal of Chu, and Zimu [the chief minister] commissioned him to regulate the government levies and count the number of cuirasses and weapons each fief had to contribute . . . Wei Yan made a register of arable lands, measured the mountains and forests, calculated the area of marshlands, distinguished the highlands and the downs, listed salt tracts, enumerated the borders of flooded areas, measured the area of diked reservoirs, regularized balks to divide the plains between embankments, assigned low wetlands for pasturage, divided fertile land into units shaped like the graph “jing”  ́ [well]. He determined the levies due, fixing the number of chariots and horses to be contributed, and assessing the numbers of chariot drivers, foot soldiers, and armored soldiers with shields that had to be mustered. He presented the results to Zimu. They were all proper.45
The first five chapters of the Guideways provide measurements of the distances between each mountain in addition to the location of useful trees, plants, and minerals. The presence of metals including copper is noted in over two hundred places, while a few mountains are specifically prohibited from being climbed. As geographical knowledge expanded through increased travel, military campaigns, and government-sponsored expeditions, heightened diplomatic relations led to greater contacts with neighboring as well as more distant foreign peoples.46 The Bamboo Annals (Zhushu jinian, c. 299 b.c.e.) records strange peoples such as the People with Per

forated Chests [no. 220] and the Long-Thighs People [no. 240] as visiting the Chinese court as early as the time of the Yellow Thearch.47 Painted scrolls with extensive colophons that survive from the Six Dynasties period indicate that records were kept of such peoples, including images of their appearance, a practice that may have begun much earlier (see fig. 14, page 56). Zuo’s Narratives, in an anecdote dated 559 b.c.e., describes one of the Jiang-Rong tribes dwelling in the northwest and details the complex relations between them and neighboring Chinese states after they were displaced by the expanding state of Qin.48 The sections of the Guideways on foreign peoples, though containing much that is fantastic, record information that also appears in these and other early sources as well. Last, the Guideways can be related to an important group of texts that lie somewhat outside the mainstream of those mentioned above. The various performance pieces that were later grouped together in the Songs of Chu (Chuci, c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.) anthology strongly reflect shamanistic cultural elements, although they were probably written down by poets or other literary figures. Chu was the major feudal state in what is now central and southern China and a strong contender during the Warring States. Its culture was regarded by the other Chinese states, especially those of the Central Plains and to the northeast, as only partially civilized and was characterized by its strong faith in shamanistic religion. Among these texts are “itineraria” such as the poems “On Encountering Sorrow” (Lisao) and “The Far-O Journey” (Yuanyu) in which the purported author, the disgraced aristocratic o‹cial Qu Yuan (c. 339–c. 278 b.c.e.), embarks on spirit-journeys. After losing his influence at court, he goes into exile, visiting mythical realms, and meets gods, goddesses, and strange creatures as well as shamans. Both “The Summons of the Soul” (Zhaohun) and “The Great Summons” (Dazhao) enact the ritual of recalling the soul back to the recently dead body in the hope of e ecting a resurrection, a common practice carried out by spirit-mediums. “The Nine Songs” ( Jiuge) is perhaps the most closely related to shamanistic religious performance. Most of its pieces celebrate eroticized encounters with a range of high gods and nature deities who are invoked to appear. But the work that most closely matches the encyclopedic impulse of the Guideways is the “Questions of Heaven” (Tianwen), a veritable Chinese Theogony that extensively records the origins of the world and numerous myths in the form of riddles. After the Guideways, this song is the second greatest repository of ancient mythology and often confirms its content. It is worth noting that the earliest commentator, Wang Yi (c. 89–c. 158 c.e.), believed that it was Qu Yuan’s ironic commentary on murals in the ancestral temple of the kings of Chu that depicted mythic scenes and strange creatures.49 Modern scholars doubt that the Songs of Chu were produced by a single author and, more important, see these pieces as literary transformations of religious ideas and practices that could have also functioned as entertainment. This suggests that the Guideways may have been similarly committed to writing not by wu-shamans themselves but by others. It is not impossible that certain strata of the Guideways could have been transcribed by literate wu-shamans who, in the era of competing, text-based schools, wished to preserve their knowledge or reinforce their oral authority with a written work of their own. But it is more likely that a broader spectrum of experts including occult philosophers in what was later collectively called the School of Techniques and Calculations

and other, private scholars may have compiled this as a reference text. Scribes in private aristocratic or feudal court libraries could have also contributed to piecing the book together from these and other sources both written and oral. Gradually, it was expanded for purely pragmatic purposes related to government administration as well as to fulfill the needs of patrons to know more about the world and its strange creatures. What does seem clear is that the Guideways took form over some time and that its diverse content served a variety of purposes. Largely because of the unique light that the Songs of Chu shines on the spiritual beliefs of late Chu, and based on certain linguistic traces in the text, some scholars in recent years have argued that the Guideways itself is largely a product of Chu writers and reflects a worldview that is more characteristic of this feudal state than any other.50 Chu was the largest of the Zhou feudal states as well as one of the most aggressive and expansionist. It ultimately absorbed more than sixty states and numerous tribal groups. There is still some debate over the origins of the Chu people and their early history. According to some scholars, the core ethnicities may have migrated from the north and eventually by the Eastern Zhou period established themselves in central China along the Han and middle reaches of the Long (Yangtze) River in modern Hubei, then regarded as the South. Among the ancestors claimed by its royal house were the Yellow Thearch, Zhuanxu, Old-Child (Laotong), and Zhurong, all of whom are mentioned in the Guideways. It was one of the first states to break away from the ritual authority of the central Zhou court and, over the course of more than five centuries, became a major contender to reunify the Chinese world. By the time it was defeated by Qin in 223 b.c.e., its borders had extended west into Ba-Shu (modern Sichuan), north into the Central Plains area (modern Shaanxi and Henan), east to Wu-Yue (modern Jiangsu and Zhejiang), northeast into Qi and Lu (modern Shandong), and southward into the ManBarbarian areas (modern Hunan and Jiangxi). This area covered each of the five directions, and its government would have had particular need for a cosmography consistent with the framework of the Guideways. Although Chu maintained certain common cultural features with other Chinese states and the central Zhou court, it nevertheless also increasingly became di erentiated from them. During its greatest expansion in the Spring and Autumn period, it was highly successful in absorbing the beliefs and artistic styles of the many non-Chinese states on its periphery that it gradually engulfed so that others particularly associated it with shamanistic and demonological practices, the worship of nature gods, and the early Daoist philosophy expressed in such texts as the Old Master (Laozi, late 3rd cent. b.c.e.) and the Master Zhuang. Even during its gradual decline in the Warring States period, it still expanded eastward. After its military defeat, Chu continued to be a major cultural and political force well into the Han dynasty, whose imperial family also originated from this region. Thus, though conclusive proof is still lacking, there is some reason to regard Chu as the place where a critical shaping of the Guideways may have occurred, even though its content could also reflect the worldview of a more northern or western state such as Qin. Unfortunately, there is so far no clear indication of what precise form the text took during the Zhou dynasty, and there are no direct references to it among the other early surviving texts, despite instances of similar content. The book evidently escaped the various bibliocausts that occurred under the Qin and early Western Han dynasties, probably ow

ing to its practical use, but it was not until the first century b.c.e. that it was mentioned by name and began to be edited into the form we now know.
READINGS OF THE TEXT
The first recorded reference to the Guideways is an unsympathetic one by the Grand Historian Sima Qian (c. 145–c. 86 b.c.e.) in his Historical Records (c. 90 b.c.e.). Notably opposed to the influence of wu-shamans and their culture, he compared the book’s data on the origin of the Yellow River with the report of the Chinese emissary Zhang Qian (d. 114 b.c.e.), who had traveled to numerous kingdoms in Central Asia on a diplomatic mission from 139–126 b.c.e. on behalf of Emperor Wu of the Western Han (r. 141–87 b.c.e.). Sima Qian wrote that he considered the Guideways and a similar cosmography, the now-lost Basic Annals of Yu (Yu benji, n.d.), unreliable, for Zhang had made no mention of having found the site of Mount Kunlun, the mythological axis mundi that figures prominently in the Guideways.51 This attitude reflected the beginning of a bifurcation between various genres of narrative with highly fabricated content on the one hand and o‹cial historiography, with its more stringent criteria for factuality, on the other. Such a distinction would grow in Chinese literature and lead some scholars in later centuries to also challenge the Guideways as an accurate description of the world. Nevertheless, Sima Qian’s remark indicates that in his time, the text must have been an important source normally consulted for geographical matters.52 Despite this point of view and even though many of its strange creatures were no longer familiar to readers in the Han, the Guideways enjoyed a renewed popularity as a catalogue for interpreting omens.53 Omenology had long played a role in Chinese politics, but it became particularly important during this period as imperial governments sought to interpret sightings of strange creatures as signs of heaven’s will. O‹cials and private scholars who pursued the ideals of “universal learning” and “knowledge of things,” a broad field of inquiry that often focused on natural phenomena and curiosities, regularly reported the appearance of anomalies to the court from as far away as distant provinces to support partisan positions as well as to promote themselves as men of sagely vision. During the reign of Emperor Xuan (r. 74–49 b.c.e.), the imperial court bibliographer Liu Xiang (c. 79–8 b.c.e.) identified a mysterious body found bound and shackled in a cave in Shang Commandery (modern Suide, Shaanxi) as that of the Minister of Erfu [no. 268] based on a passage in the Guideways.54 His son, Liu Xin (46 b.c.e.–23 c.e.), who succeeded him as court bibliographer and edited the first known version of the text, wrote in his preface to it: “The emperor was greatly surprised. Since then, many court scholars have particularly esteemed the Guideways through Mountains and Seas and the Ru-Confucian erudites have all studied it. They consider it a unique work, a means of investigating auspicious and strange phenomenon as well as of observing the customs of foreign peoples in distant lands.”55 Liu Xin was himself a proponent of omenology in connection with Five Agents cosmology. He also recorded an earlier incident involving Dongfang Shuo (154–93 b.c.e.), a charismatic scholar and fangshi-wizard at the court of Emperor Wu. One day, a strange bird was presented to the palace and refused to eat anything until Dongfang Shuo identified it and described its eating habits, claiming to have obtained the information from the Guideways.56 Both

anecdotes reiterate the theme of the Guan Zhong story, suggesting that knowledge of strange creatures continued to be a useful component of political discourse at court, though with the additional element of citing a textual reference to support one’s claims. Liu Xin had been charged by the emperor with carrying on his father’s work of recovering surviving texts from the pre-Qin period and assembling an imperial library that comprehended all the valuable knowledge of the time. Many of the Warring States texts that we have today passed through his hands and were substantially edited by him. As a leader in an intellectual and political faction among scholars later called the “Ancient-Text School,” he and his associates challenged those in the so-called “New-Text School,” whose cultural authority was more dependent on oral traditions and on other, later texts. This power struggle contributed to the collapse of the Western Han dynasty in 8 c.e. and the establishment of Wang Mang’s (45 b.c.e.–23 c.e.) short-lived Xin dynasty in which Liu Xin and the Ancient-Text partisans played a major ideological role. When Liu presented his edited version of the Guideways to the Western Han imperial court in 6 b.c.e. during a period of intense power struggle between the two factions, he introduced it as a valuable vestige of a remote time, writing that “it contains the events of earlier sages and worthies clearly transcribed in ancient graphs, the nature of these events being both comprehensible and credible.”57 Liu Xin’s editorial contributions to this and other ancient texts were probably considerable. Because his edition only survives through that of the scholar and commentator Guo Pu (276–324) three centuries later, modern scholars are still seeking to uncover Liu Xin’s precise role. He may have stitched together several separate cosmographies into one book, noted variant versions of these texts, reorganized the chapters, and perhaps interpolated additional material. In addition, he probably translated the ancient graphs from their archaic styles into the simpler, more standardized calligraphic forms that had evolved during the Han dynasty. But to preserve the mythical authority of the text, he typically refrained from revealing too much about his role.58 Some decades later during the Eastern Han, a scholar whom one might have expected to express some reservations about the fabrications in the Guideways was the iconoclastic thinker Wang Chong (27–c. 100 c.e.), but he too recognized its usefulness for those involved in court politics. Like Sima Qian, he disparaged shamanistic culture, though he shared the general belief in the existence of dragons and other strange creatures. In one of the essays in his Judicious Disquisitions entitled “Special Understanding” (Lunheng: Bietong, c. 70–80 c.e.), Wang supported the traditional authorship of Yu the Great and his o‹cial Yi, considering them intrepid explorers who never could have written the Guideways if they had not personally traveled. He also praised Liu Xiang as an open-minded thinker whose reading of the text enabled him to obtain “universal knowledge” of the world that Liu was able to e ectively employ at court.59 The Guideways continued to be consulted at this time as a practical geography. When Emperor Ming (r. 57–75 c.e.) dispatched the o‹cial Wang Jing (d. c. 83 c.e.) to reinforce the dikes along the Yellow River and Bian Canal in 69 c.e., he ordered a copy of it given to Wang along with the “Treatise on Rivers and Canals” chapter of the Historical Records (Shiji: Hequshu) and the now-lost Maps to the Tributes of Yu (Yugongtu, n.d.).60
The next important mention of the Guideways appears in the earliest surviving bibliography, the “Treatise on Literature” in the o‹cial History of the Han Dynasty (Han

shu: Yiwenzhi, late 1st cent. c.e.) This is generally thought to be based on Liu Xiang and Liu Xin’s earlier, now-lost catalogue of the imperial library, the Seven Classifications (Qilue, c. late 1st cent. c.e.). The Guideways was now considered an occult text that had been espoused by members of an eclectic philosophical school called Techniques and Calculations (Shushujia). The works in this category were distinguished from the more orthodox, canonical texts of the Ru-Confucian tradition, for the members of this school had by now been relegated to the lesser ranks of specialist practitioners. According to the bibliographer’s note, the 190 books in this category all represent lost traditions of knowledge from the Zhou dynasty and are further subdivided into six specialties: astronomy and astrology; calendrical calculation; Five Agents cosmology; milfoil and tortoise-shell divination; other methods of divination; and determinations of forms. The Guideways was listed in this last group, which includes six works on geomancy and physiognomy. Some later scholars have felt that this classification is too limited, but the “Treatise” did not yet envision more appropriate categories such as geography and regarded all these texts as essentially practical manuals employed by occult experts.61 Even in Liu Xin’s time, it was felt that there was no longer a direct connection with the original worldview of the Guideways, and the bibliographer of the “Treatise” reiterated this by stating, “the book remains but its original expositors are gone.”62 More than two centuries later, when Guo Pu established what is essentially the final version between 310 and 324 c.e. and added his invaluable commentary, China’s political and cultural environment had further changed.63 Following the collapse of the Han empire, the country fragmented again into smaller, warring states, each adopting the institutions of an imperial dynasty. In the four centuries until reunification under the Sui, Confucianism managed to survive in a less energetic form as an o‹cial ideology with limited intellectual appeal. However, the new, more sophisticated religions of Daoism and Buddhism o ered increased possibilities of demonological control as well as new methods of individual spiritual transcendence, in part by developing techniques of the earlier wu-shamans and fangshi-wizards. Meanwhile, with the decline of a dominant court culture, private scholars seeking to define their identities in a fluid, unstable society cultivated the ideals of “universal knowledge” and “knowledge of things” in more personal ways. They pursued “mystical learning” by speculating on the relationships between the human and the spiritual while seeking greater understanding about strange phenomena. New literary genres spread during this period such as accounts of anomalies and local geographies, religious scriptures, as well as a wide range of manuals of the occult, many of which transmitted ancient mythology and other information related to the content of the Guideways. Guo Pu revived the book in this new intellectual context alongside such other important works of the early and middle fourth century as Gan Pao’s (fl. 1st half of 4th cent.) anthology of accounts of anomalies, Collected Accounts in Search of Spirits (Soushenji, c. 335–49), and Guo Xiang’s (d. 312) definitive edition of the Master Zhuang. Other cosmographical works of this period such as the anonymous Guideways to Gods and Anomalies (Shenyijing, late Han–Six Dynasties) is an obvious and highly fantastic imitation of the original Guideways, while Chang Qu’s (fl. 4th cent. c.e.) Gazetteer of the Lands South of Lotus Mountain (Huayangguo zhi, c. 347) continued the tradition of including both mythological and historical material within a geographic framework. A

particularly influential event was the rediscovery of the historical chronicle The Bamboo Annals and the pseudohistorical itinerary The Chronicle of King Mu. The latter purportedly documents the extensive tour of a Western Zhou dynasty king of the mid-tenth century b.c.e. as he encountered various gods and non-Chinese peoples, including the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275]. Both works were recovered some time around 279/81 c.e from an aristocrat’s tomb dated c. 299 b.c.e. and were also edited by Guo Pu, who used them in his commentary to support the factuality of the Guideways. Yet another text about strange creatures circulating during this era was the Master Lie (Liezi, c. 4th cent.), a later Daoist anthology of myths and fables purportedly from the Warring States period.64
The Daoist Ge Hong’s (283–343) Biographies of Gods and Transcendents (Shenxianzhuan, before 317), following the model of Liu Xiang’s Biographies of Various Transcendents (Liexianzhuan, 1st cent. b.c.e.), gathered detailed descriptions of some ancient and more recent gods, cultic figures, and magical practioners who together comprised a new, more complex, and universalized pantheon. In another of his writings, The Master Who Embraces Simplicity, a chapter titled “Into Mountains and Over Streams” (Baopuzi: Dengshe, c. 320) presented beliefs about strange creatures in the landscape and esoteric techniques of managing them consistent with the ethos of Yu’s Nine Tripods and the use of the Guideways as a guide for travelers:
All mountains, whether large or small, contain gods and powers, and the strength of these divinities is directly proportional to the size of the mountains. To enter the mountains without the proper recipe is to be certain of anxiety or harm. In some cases people fall ill, are wounded, or become stricken with fear. In other cases, lights and shadows are seen, strange sounds are heard. Lack of the proper recipe can make a large tree fall when there is no wind, or a high rock fall for no apparent reason, striking and killing people. It can confuse such travelers or drive them madly onward so that they fall into ravines. Lack of preparation may cause you to meet with tigers, wolves, or poisonous insects that will harm you. Mountains are not to be entered lightly.65
Guo Pu was a scholar of broad interests and skills: a poet expressing Daoist philosophical sentiments, an anthologizer of accounts of anomalies, a proponent of early texts dealing with mythology and the occult, a lexicographer of ancient semantics and phonology, and a practitioner of divination in politics who as a court o‹cial employed some of the skills of the earlier fangshi-wizards.66 In his edition of the Guideways, he championed it as an important aid in the intellectual and spiritual search of his age. His ideal reader should be an independent thinker unfazed by contemporary opinion who belongs to a select group of cognoscenti. “It is di‹cult to discuss the meanings of the Guideways with anyone who does not possess a universal mind,” he stated and expressed the hope that enlightened readers pursuing “universal knowledge” would scrutinize the book. However, he anachronistically argued that it supplemented the themes of the Master Zhuang, a work revered by Daoists, Buddhists, and more secular scholars whose skeptical philosophy had little in common with the shamanistic beliefs in the Guideways. Nevertheless, Guo maintained that the fantastic quality of the Guideways
16 INTRODUCTION



enabled the enlightened reader to grasp the Master Zhuang’s theme of the relativity of rational judgments about reality. He apparently felt no conflict between this position and more animistic and demonological beliefs and argued that what people conventionally regard as the strange is a legitimate part of nature:
People who read the Guideways through Mountains and Seas today all suspect it because of its exaggerations and absurdly extravagant claims and because of its many strange and fanciful expressions. I have often discussed this by quoting Master Zhuang who said “What people know is inferior to what they do not know.” I have certainly seen this in the case of the Guideways. For, how can one completely describe the vastness of the universe, the abundant forms of life, the benevolent sustenance of yin and yang, the myriad distinctions between things, the admixture of essences bubbling over in conflict, wandering souls and strange divinities who take on form, migrate to mountains and rivers, and adopt beautiful appearances as trees and rocks? Yet,
Coordinating their diverse tendencies, they resonate as a single echo: Perfecting their transformations, they blend into one image.
People call some things “strange” yet they know not why they call them so; they call some things “familiar,” yet they know not why either. What is the reason behind this? A thing is not strange in itself; it depends on me to make it strange. It is from this “me” that its strangeness results: it is not that the thing is fundamentally strange.67
Guo’s commentary defined the major scholarly issues for a hermeneutical reading of the Guideways. These sought to resolve a set of traditional textual problems that included pronunciation and transcription of graphs, identification of geographical places, correction of textual errors, dating and organization of the chapters, identifying the authorship, and interpreting the recorded myths. Simultaneously, Guo Pu also introduced the possibility of more personal, alternative readings by composing some three hundred short poems known as the Encomiums to the Illustrations of the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing tuzan, c. 320).68 Each consists of six lines of four graphs celebrating the images of the strange creatures that circulated during his time. These too form a kind of commentary though often with a playful, irreverent tone that demystifies the authority of the text. Most of the encomiums cleverly paraphrase the original descriptions, but a number express Guo’s own delight and amazement at the oddity of the creatures—precisely a perception of their bizarre otherness that Guo’s preface urges the enlightened reader to suspend. For example, the Pearl-Turtles [no. 145] are recorded in chapter 4 as living in abundance in the Li River and resembling lungs with eyes, possessing six feet, and containing pearls. Their taste is sweet and sour, and they can cure seasonal epidemics if eaten. Guo’s ironic encomium regards them more symbolically from the Master Zhuang’s view that usefulness invites exploitation:
INTRODUCTION 17



These are rareties from the River Li, Like floating lungs, their shape. Embodying Heaven, Earth, and Man, They su er harm, becoming trade. Possessing so many uses, How can they possibly escape?69
Among other admiring readers who responded in poems to the illustrations of the Guideways was the lyric poet Tao Qian (365–427). Tao’s poems were typically autobiographical. Having renounced the conventional ladder of success through an o‹cial career, he often a‹rmed instead the purer existence of rural life and literary creativity. With the inevitable glass of wine in hand, Tao composed a cycle of thirteen poems, “On Reading the Guideways through Mountains and Seas” (Du shanhaijing shisanshou), which he began by announcing his pleasure at perusing the illustrations of the strange creatures. His use of the expression liuguan (to randomly contemplate) to describe his process of reading suggests a more constituitive e ort of visualization similar to others of his time who employed a meditative attitude when viewing landscape paintings to engage in “spiritual wandering.”70 These poems reveal three principal responses. Some figures are vehicles for expressing his political frustrations and criticisms. Others are envied for dwelling in utopian environments, and still others are considered tragic characters evoking commiseration. The latter can be seen in poem ten about Spirit-Guardian [no. 133], who su ered drowning, and Xingtian [no. 233], who was punished with decapitation. Tao regarded both sympathetically, for even though they metamorphosed after their deaths, they remained trapped by the resentments of their pasts:
Spirit-Guardian bites hold of twigs Determined to fill up the deep-blue sea. Xingtian dances wildly with spear and shield: His old ambitions still burn fiercely. After blending with things, no anxieties should remain; After metamorphosing, all one’s regrets should flee. In vain do they cling to their hearts from the past. How can they, a better day, foresee?71
Such individualistic responses by the poet eschewed the hermeneutics of the scholarly commentator in favor of an escape to an exotic world full of amazement whose strange creatures could stimulate the creative imagination. This attitude a‹rming personal meanings of the text through figurative interpretations was later charmingly depicted in an illustration in the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting ( Jieziyuan huazhuan, 1679), in which a recumbent scholar leisurely gazes at the illustrations in a direct allusion to Tao Qian (see frontispiece).72 Following the success of Guo Pu’s edition, no new commentaries were written for more than a thousand years. Nevertheless, the text continued to circulate at imperial courts as well as among scholars, Daoists, and various other kinds of occult practitioners

both in handwritten copies and through citations in other texts.73 A reference to it can also be found in a Tang manuscript of strange creatures from the Silk Road oasis city of Dunhuang (see fig. 2o, page 65). In the next major o‹cial bibliography after the Han, which was included in the History of the Sui Dynasty (Suishu: Jingjizhi, 656), the Guideways was moved from the “School of Techniques and Calculations” category to the head of the new geography subcategory of the history section in the Four Libraries system.74 This reflected a growing recognition of it as the locus classicus of such later genres as the local gazetteer, which presented information about the geography, history, folklore and customs of individual counties.75 It remained a credible source of geographical information during the Tang, when it was used by Sima Zhen (fl. 8th cent.) in his commentary to Sima Qian’s Historical Records. With the development of commercial woodblock printing in the Song dynasty, elite as well as more popular editions began to be printed. You Mao (1127–1193), a bibliophile who published the earliest surviving edition through a local government printing house (fig. 3) noted in his preface dated March 5, 1180, that he had consulted more than ten existing editions, including one that had already been incorporated into the Song Daoist Canon (Daozang, printed early 11th cent.).76 Previously, the scholar Yan Zhitui (531–c. 591) had recognized that the text contained place-names that could not have predated the Han dynasty. However, he attributed this fact to interpolations by later hands

and did not challenge the traditional attribution to Yu the Great and his o‹cial, Yi.77 You was perhaps the first scholar to express doubts about Yu’s authorship in print. Not only did he believe that the Guideways was mostly compiled sometime just before the Qin period, but he voiced a new, historical appreciation of it. In his opinion, as a record of an archaic cultural mentality, the text was worth preserving simply because of its antiquity, quite apart from any practical use.78 The Song dynasty witnessed one of the high points of the scholar culture in the imperial state. Reinvigorated by the more metaphysically inclined ideology of NeoConfucianism, some intellectuals continued to evince an interest in the Guideways. This interest reflected not only the perennial desire to comprehend strange phenomena but the challenge to render such things intelligible in terms of the more rational spirit of the age. Large collections of classical short stories both old and new, such as the Extensive Records of the Taiping Era (Taiping guangji, printed 981) and Yijian’s Accounts (Yijianzhi, 1161–1198), contained narratives that expanded the conventions of the Han and Six Dynasties anomaly accounts. These included more humanistic themes in the representation of the strange, developing a tendency that had earlier arisen in Tang fiction. Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Neo-Confucianism’s most influential formulator who was later canonized as a paragon of intellectual orthodoxy, was quite familiar with the Guideways and maintained a particular interest in the religious world of the Songs of Chu.79 He not only defended the legitimate existence of strange creatures but sought to explain them in terms of the concept of cosmic patterns operating in conjunction with the vital energy of things. In response to a question from one of his students, he replied:
The monsters of the mountains are called “Demons” and “Wangliang.” The monsters of the water are called “Dragons” and “Wangxiang.” And, the monsters of the earth are called “Fenyang.” All these are produced by confused and perverse vital energy and are surely not without a cosmic pattern—you mustn’t stubbornly think they do not contain a cosmic pattern. It’s like the winter’s being cold and the summer’s being warm; this is the normal pattern. But there are times when suddenly in the summer it turns cold and in the winter it turns warm—how can we say there isn’t a pattern for this! Still, because it isn’t an ordinary pattern we consider it strange.80
This continuity of interest in the strange despite shifts in intellectual thought can be compared to the long fascination in Europe with the Marvels of the East, an ancient Greek tradition beginning in the early fourth century b.c.e. of hybrid monsters and ethnographical oddities believed to dwell in India. These texts underwent several metamorphoses and continued to be transmitted in Europe through the Middle Ages, surviving in pseudoscientific form into the Enlightenment. Its concept of “India” was highly mythical, not only denoting that land but places beyond it as well. Despite the increase in travel and the more factual accounts that appeared over the centuries, many European scholars continued to a‹rm the existence of these creatures somewhere in the direction of the distant east. There are intriguing parallels between some of these figures and foreign tribes in the Guideways such as people with large, heavy ears that they must carry (fig. 4), who may be compared to the People Who Hold Up Their Ears [no. 246]

and the Pendant-Ears People [no. 328]. Similarly, there are also people with a single leg, men with dog’s heads, a headless people with faces on their torsos, and people whose heels are reversed. Whether these indigenously emerged from the European and Near Eastern imaginations or represent the dissemination of ancient myths from elsewhere remains to be explored, but just as in China, the representations of these strange creatures in texts confirmed their existence for readers well into a period when a spirit of empiricism and greater exploration of the world began to take hold.81 The Guideways continued to be reprinted during the succeeding Yuan and Ming dynasties.82 During the early part of the Ming, editions were sponsored by the o‹cial Directorate of Education and circulated in handwritten copies as well as in a new printing of the Daoist Canon (c. 1444–45). These largely continued the interests of Song scholasticism and simply reprinted Guo Pu’s commentary. It was not until the middle of the sixteenth century, however, that another revival of interest in the book began that continued through the Qing dynasty and into the modern period. The burgeoning commercial economy and urban culture of this period supported a rapid expansion of popular printing and of a wide variety of relatively inexpensive books to serve a broader readership beyond the elite level of scholars. Some of these developments provided additional contexts for appreciating the Guideways. Among the newer genres disseminating knowledge of strange creatures was vernacular fiction, notably Wu Cheng’en’s (c. 1500–c. 1582) allegory, The Journey to the West (Xiyouji, printed 1592), which contained numerous demons challenging the spiritual progress of the heroes as

they journeyed to India. Other late-Ming novels such as Epic Tales Since Creation (Kaipi yanyi, c. early 17th cent.) and The Investiture of the Gods (Fengshen yanyi, mid–late 16th cent.) retold myths of thearchs and other gods mixed with elements of later mythology and historiography.83 The immense popularity of fiction among all classes began to alter the reception of the Guideways from that of a geographical work to a collection of ancient narratives. This change is suggested by the perceptive literary critic and textual scholar Hu Yinglin (1551–1602), who was one of the first to write about the generic characteristics of “minor narratives” (xiaoshuo). This category originally denoted marginal or ideologically unorthodox stories that were gradually excised from o‹cial historiography. In the hands of later critics such as Hu Yinglin, “minor narratives” evolved into the closest concept traditional China had to fiction before the modern era. Like You Mao, he considered the Guideways an anonymous work of the Warring States period, but in calling it “the origin of stories about the strange,” he redefined its position as the fountainhead of a tradition of imaginatively developed narratives that stretched from oral tales and anomaly accounts through Tang and Song classical stories and Yuan and Ming dramas to the vernacular novel and short story.84 Travel writing, especially in the form of the travel account, had become a legitimate genre among scholars by the Song and was now being composed in abundance as journeying within China became an important leisure activity as well as a mode of scholarly self-cultivation.85 This practice also led to a new appreciation of the Guideways and of other early cosmographies and geographical works. Xu Hongzu (1586–1641) was inspired to devote his life to exploring the Chinese world by reading such texts and produced monumental travel diaries that recorded his extensive journeys in minute detail. Although China under the Ming had largely turned inward and sought to restrict foreign contacts, events such as the seven naval explorations of the eunuch-admiral Zheng He (1371–1435) to South Asia and East Africa from 1405 to 1433, the continuing visits of tribute-bearing emissaries from neighboring peoples, and the arrival of European traders and missionaries fanned interest in gathering intelligence about foreigners. One result of this interest was the publication of a number of works that continued the tradition of court records of tributary peoples such as the compendium Records of Foreign Guests (Xianbinlu, 1590–1591), as well as illustrated collections such as the Illustrations and Records of Foreign Lands (Yiyu tuzhi, Ming dynasty, see fig. 26a, page 72) selections from which were also reproduced in popular encyclopedias.86 The range of religious beliefs of the Chinese during the Ming remained complex, with divergent attitudes toward strange creatures. On the one hand, popular religion continued, as it had for centuries, to be largely focused on using shamanistic and demonological practices for personal benefit. This fact was remarked upon by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–1610), who reported back to his European correspondents on aspects of Chinese life. He noted with evident disapproval the widespread practice of exorcists plastering the walls of houses with pictures of monstrous strange creatures drawn in ink on yellow paper.87 On a more organized level, the three teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism remained well-established, and proponents spread knowledge of the still-expanding pantheons of gods through such popular illustrated publications as the Complete Encyclopedia of Gods of the Three Teachings (Sanjiao soushen daquan, Yuan-Ming).88 Furthermore, the Chinese had become aware of even more gods
22 INTRODUCTION



and demons from the Tibetans and Central Asians as a result of the earlier Mongol conquest, while Christianity had begun its contacts with the imperial court and among the people in certain cities and trading areas. On the other hand, there was also a minor, though noticeable trend toward iconoclasm among some Confucian scholars who believed that representing gods in temples interfered with a direct comprehension of the moral Way (Dao). They managed to sponsor the destruction of some city gods for a short time and to proscribe the use of images of them in the state cult.89 But such attempts at visual purification were of limited e ect and in no way diminished the general interest on all social levels in continuing to obtain knowledge about strange creatures. Among the earliest Ming scholars to closely reexamine the text of the Guideways was Yang Shen (1488–1559). An unsuccessful o‹cial, he was sentenced to internal exile in Yunnan province in the distant south where aboriginal tribes, non-Chinese local cults, and shamanism were still pervasive. While there, he further questioned the cultural orthodoxy of his time through a penchant for ancient epigraphy and investigations of strange phenomena. Yang’s Additional Comments on the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing bu), edited by Zhou Shi in 1554, is but a short series of speculations on the meaning of ancient characters in certain passages, but it foreshadowed methods similar to those of later commentators influenced by the School of Evidential Research. Yang also imitated Guo Pu’s encomiums by writing a set to another work, now lost, entitled Encomiums to the Illustrations of Strange Fish (Yiyu tuzan, n.d.).90
The first new, full-length commentary since Guo Pu appeared in Wang Chongqing’s (1484–1565) edition titled the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Explanatory Comments (Shanhaijing shiyi) with a preface by him dated 1537. Wang had earned the metropolitan graduate degree in 1508 and rose to the prestigious positions of minister of both the ministries of rites and personnel in Nanjing. The author of commentaries on the five Confucian classics, he sought to improve on Guo Pu, whose version he regarded as too enamored of the strange and insu‹ciently concerned with elucidating the rational cosmic patterns of Neo-Confucianism. Despite occasional insights, Wang’s views have been regarded by later scholars as largely pedestrian.91 Nevertheless, the book remained popular among middlebrow readers, who were undoubtedly impressed by the status and orthodox reputation of the commentator. It was to one of the later reprints of Wang’s edition in 1597 that the earliest surviving illustrations reproduced here were appended [plates I–LXXVI]. Wang Chongqing’s edition was followed in the early Qing dynasty by another popular edition with a commentary by Wu Renchen (c. 1628–c. 1689), the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Extensive Commentaries (Shanhaijing guangzhu, 1667).92 This included Guo Pu’s commentary with additional information from other texts gathered by Wu, whom the preface described as “a famous scholar for over thirty years.” Wu was from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and primarily known at this time for his historical scholarship. Later, he served in the Hanlin Academy, where he helped compile the o‹cial History of the Ming Dynasty (Mingshi, printed 1739), especially the treatise on the calendar. The abundant data reflecting Wu’s broad reading is often useful in tracing later references to myths, places, and strange creatures in the original text, though it is randomly assembled without su‹cient discrimination of his sources. Of similar interest are two

introductory chapters. One collects prefaces and numerous evaluative remarks by scholars through the ages tracing the reception of the text from Liu Xin onward. The other, titled “Remarks on How to Read the Guideways” (Du shanhaijing yu), employs a genre in the form of random notes favored by late Ming and Qing literary critics to guide readers in appreciating the superior qualities of texts, especially fictional and dramatic works. In addition to dealing with traditional questions of authorship, composition, and etymology, Wu Renchen wisely urged the reader not to assume a correspondence between the geography in the Guideways and present-day locations. He also recognized an aesthetic dimension of the language by noting its recurring rhythmic formulas. Wu’s version included a di erent set of illustrations in the portrait format, which later became the ones most commonly reproduced (see figs. 26c, 26d, page 72). The grand bibliographical project known as the Complete Works of the Four Libraries (Siku quanshu, 1773–1782) sponsored by the Qing court gathered more than ten thousand books known in China at that time, reprinting 3,461 of the most important ones while suppressing others deemed to be seditious. The catalogue of descriptive notes produced by one of the chief editors, Ji Yun (1724–1805), evaluated the acceptable works and expressed an orthodox judgment of them reflecting the highest contemporary standards of scholarship and taste. The Guideways is represented by three editions: a palace edition with Guo Pu’s commentary, the Wu Renchen edition, and the Wang Chongqing edition. Wang’s edition fares the worst: both his commentary and the illustrations are dismissed in two lines, the latter denigrated as inauthentic creations by later commercial artists. Wu’s is given a qualified approval. It was one of the works reprinted, although without Wu’s illustrations, which Ji Yun also considered spurious. The entry on the palace edition provided the opportunity to discuss traditional historiographical issues. In contrast to the commentators and bibliographers over the centuries who valued its usefulness, Ji Yun reflected the skepticism of those who criticized the Guideways’ lack of factuality, and he opposed the tendency to regard it as a geographical work. A compiler of anomaly accounts himself, he considered it as the “ancestor of ‘minor narratives.’” All three versions were now classified under the “minor narratives” section in the philosophy category of the Four Libraries system to emphasize the bibliographers’ recognition of their essential fabrication as opposed to earlier beliefs in their historicity.93 Ji Yun’s opinion, which carried the imprimatur of the Qing court, appeared to denigrate the text from a historiographical point of view, while his classification of it among “minor narratives” further supported the alternative reading earlier suggested by Hu Yinglin. This occurred during the century when the short story writer Pu Songling (1640–1715), the poet Yuan Mei (1716–1798), and Ji Yun himself produced collections of short classical tales about strange phenomena that combined the narrative conventions of earlier anomaly accounts and classical short stories with a new degree of aesthetic imagination and ideological self-consciousness.94 The Complete Works of the Four Libraries project was finished before the two great Qing dynasty editions of the Guideways appeared, which summed up the traditional scholarship of the text. Both were compiled by scholars who were opposed to the judgment of Ji Yun and the other editors of the Complete Works and were designed to reassert Guo Pu’s belief in the essential factuality of the text. The first was that of Bi Yuan (1730–1797), a high o‹cial and noted patron of other scholars who reached the

rank of minister in the ministry of war and vice censor-in-chief. His version, A Newly Corrected Edition of the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing xinjiaozheng), was completed in 1781 after a five-year study of the text while he was serving in Xi’an as provincial governor of Shaanxi. Bi’s interest in geography was stimulated by his travels, which took him beyond the Jade Gate (modern Yumen, Gansu), China’s traditional border in the west. His commentary was appended to Guo Pu’s and designed to supplement and correct it by primarily o ering new or alternative opinions on the geographical locations of the mountains and rivers. These were largely based on careful collation of textual sources using the more intensive scholarly methods of the School of Evidential Research, but some reflect his personal experience as a traveler. A few of these identifications are plausible and have gained acceptance, but many remain questionable. More significant is his defense of the fundamental credibility of the Guideways. In contrast to Ji Yun, Bi argued that the book was not at all concerned with discussing the strange, for if the language were understood figuratively, even the most fantastic descriptions could be seen to refer to actual creatures or foreign peoples. This argument is not entirely convincing in practice, but it reveals a rare sensitivity to the nature of mythological discourse as di erent from the semiotics of historical writing.95 This was also the essential stance of Hao Yixing’s more comprehensive Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Supplementary Commentaries (Shanhaijing jianshu, preface 1804), for Hao also criticized the classification of the text as a “minor narrative” and furthermore supported the authorship of Yu the Great. Hao’s synthetic work also included Guo Pu’s commentary and encomiums, along with selections from Wu Renchen’s and Bi Yuan’s editions along with Hao’s additional notes. It was originally printed in Yangzhou in 1809 in a fine edition sponsored by the scholar-patron Ruan Juan (1764–1849), a latter-day promoter of ancient texts. Many of Hao’s comments address the traditional issues of Guo Pu but are presented with greater detail and superior logic and are based on broader research into other sources. Perhaps his greatest contribution is to internal textual problems such as attempting to resolve contradictions among the di erent recorded versions of myths. In an appendix, he identified and sought to correct more than three hundred misprinted graphs and produced with the help of his wife an updated count of the graphs for each chapter and for the book as a whole.96 He also appended a collection of Guo Pu’s Encomiums. Like those of other traditional commentators, Hao’s geographical identifications remain problematical, while many of his opinions have been superceded by modern research. His edition nevertheless summed up the traditional hermeneutical reading of the text and still stands as the single most authoritative one before the modern period.97 Yet alternative readings continued to appear in various other guises. Perhaps the most creative use of the Guideways appeared not long after Hao’s edition in Li Ruzhen’s (c. 1763–c. 1830) novel The Fate of Flowers in the Mirror (Jinghuayuan, printed 1828). Li exploited the satiric potential of some of the more fantastic foreign peoples from chapters 7 and 16, placing them among thirty or so island kingdoms visited by a group of fictional Chinese travelers during the Tang dynasty. Like Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), the novel can be read as an ironic cosmography that parodies the more serious works of the genre. The heroes encounter these peoples and other anomalies in comi

cal situations designed to critique the society, politics, and culture of the author’s own time.98 The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a plethora of cheaper editions of Guo Pu’s and Hao Yixing’s versions with and without illustrations. In the late Qing period, the reading public expanded further to include a new kind of middle-class reader in the treaty ports with a more modern, international outlook. One indication of the degree to which the Guideways still permeated Chinese consciousness is an amusing illustration in an issue of the Dianshizhai Pictorial (Dianshizhai huabao) of 1884 (fig. 5). This regular supplement to the influential Shanghai newspaper Shenbao presented scenes reflecting the influence of modern Japanese and Western illustration styles. They depicted current events, social life and customs, scientific advancements, and occasionally sensationalistic news designed to titillate and entertain. This particular illustration used a strange creature from the Guideways to explain a bizarre birth said to have recently taken place in Italy. Titled A Kind of Xingtian, the plate, designed by the leading illustrator Wu Rujun (fl. late 19th cent.), depicts a scene in which a female prisoner in Italy is shown after having given birth to a headless child who is represented in the manner of the illustrations of the decapitated rebel Xingtian [no. 233]. The caption explains that when she was bound with rope in prison, she became obsessed with the idea that she would lose her head and then suddenly gave birth to this anomaly. It goes on to quote the passage in the Guideways describing Xingtian, slyly suggesting that perhaps the child belongs to this species. Clearly, among the more sophisticated members of this readership, the Guideways was now regarded as an amusing source of the absurd, though, ironically, it continued to be used to identify foreigners as strange creatures. Around this time, however, the book made a deeper impression on the young Lu Xun. Lu later wrote a short reminiscence about an irritating maid he knew as a child, Achang, who finally won his undying a ection after giving him a copy of one of the inexpensive popular editions of the Guideways. He had previously seen a version in the library of a relative and became obsessed with its illustrations of strange creatures. Among those that particularly impressed him were the human-headed beasts, the nineheaded snake Minister Liu [no. 244], the Three-Legged Bird [no. 277], the winged Feathered People [no. 216], the single-footed beast Kui [no. 304], the sacklike Dijiang [no. 73], and the ever-popular image of Xingtian.99 This whetted his lifelong appetite for popular woodblock prints and illustrated books, of which he was to amass a considerable collection and whose artistry he tirelessly promoted. The New Culture Movement, which arose along with the anti-imperialist protests of May 4, 1919, ushered in a period of fundamental questioning of traditional Chinese culture and an unprecedented openness to Japanese and Western intellectual concepts. As a professor of Chinese literature at Beijing University, Lu Xun was at the forefront of a group of progressive scholars and writers during the 1920s who embraced a new role for the tradition of “minor narratives” as the precursor of a modern Chinese fiction. Influenced by comparative mythological studies from abroad, other figures such as the novelist and short story writer Shen Yanbing (1896–1981) and later the scholars Wu Han (1909–1969), Zheng Dekun (1908–1992), and the poet Wen Yiduo (1899–1946) all sought to redefine the meaning of early stories about gods, demons, and other strange

creatures. These were now called shenhua, literally “divine stories,” the modern Chinese term for “myth.”100 Just as myths were seen to have played an archetypal role in the formulation of Western literature, so it was hoped that the recovery and analysis of Chinese myths would aid in the creation of a modern Chinese culture. Lu Xun expounded his ideas about the Guideways while he was teaching a new course at Beijing University on traditional Chinese fiction from 1920 to 1924, and these first appeared when his lectures were published in 1923. Although not all of his ideas have stood the test of time, as mentioned earlier, Lu Xun was notably prescient in asserting the origins of the book as a reflection of the wu-shaman culture.101 Around the same time, modern Chinese historians such as Gu Jiegang (1893–1980) began to radically reassess the classical culture in a similar e ort to both criticize and salvage the past.102 Originally, Gu was concerned with demystifying the Confucian in

The caption reads, “In an Italian prison, a female prisoner suddenly gave birth one day to a child with a headless body. Everyone who witnessed this was amazed. Someone explained that when the prisoner had been bound with rope she feared that she would lose her head and this obsessive thought engendered the pregnancy which resulted in the birth of this strange creature. However, the Guideways through Mountains and Seas records that in the Land of the Single-Arm People [no. 231] is someone named ‘Xingtian’ [no. 233] who has a headless body where his nipples became his eyes and his navel became his mouth and who dances holding a spear and shield. Could the child of this female prisoner be one of his kind?” (In the Guideways, Xingtian is listed following the entry on the Single-Arm People but is not actually a denizen of this land.)

tellectual tradition through objective, historical inquiry in what was called the National Studies Movement. Later, he and his associates moved on to interests in folklore and popular culture in a continuing e ort to refashion a viable version of traditional Chinese civilization for the modern age. The Guideways was not subject to the intense ideological deconstruction of canonical works such as the “Tributes of Yu,” which Gu came to regard as a forgery of the Ru-Confucian school of the Warring States. He published his opinions on the first five chapters of the Guideways in 1934 and also used data from the text for his study of travel in early China. Because of his influence, new studies of its authorship, printed editions, and illustrations appeared in a magazine of historical geography that he founded and named, apparently without irony, The “Tributes of Yu” Bimonthly (Yugong banyuekan), which ran from 1934 to 1937.103 His associates in the Folkstudies Movement, which he actively spread during the 1920s and 1930s, conducted further research into relevant aspects of the Guideways. Notable examples are Zhong Jingwen’s (1902–) 1931 study of the folk medicine obtained from some of the strange creatures and Rong Zhaozu’s (1897–1994) study of some of the gods. In the mid-1930s, a volume dedicated entirely to studies of the Guideways appeared in the influential Folk Literature Series of Beijing University.104 These intellectual trends of the Republican period formed the basis for the continuing interest in mythology since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949.105 In recent decades, there has been a steadily growing interest in the book in China on the part of mythologists, literary and cultural historians, geographers, pharmacologists, ethnologists, archaeologists, art historians, and others from a variety of disciplines who have exploited its diverse material. Yuan Ke (1916–), the leading contemporary scholar of early Chinese mythology, has been a major force in focusing attention on the Guideways in recent decades. Having published a colloquial version of the text and a number of critical studies, his work culminated in 1980 in the most complete modern edition so far, the Guideways through Mountains and Seas, Corrected with Commentary (Shanhaijing jiaozhu). This is the first comprehensive commentary since Hao Yixing’s, and although some of the interpretations remain hypothetical, it not only o ers many plausible resolutions to long-standing problems in the text, but it also reinterprets many of its meanings in the light of the mythological, historical, and archaeological knowledge gained since the era of Lu Xun and Gu Jiegang.106 Outside of China, the Guideways is known to have circulated in Korea and Japan in past centuries and has also been of great interest to Japanese sinologists, especially those studying early Chinese religion. It was also among the first Chinese texts to interest European sinologists in the nineteenth century, some of whom produced partial translations as early as 1839. In recent years, there have been further translations of it into English, Japanese, Russian, German, and French, but the most accurate sinological rendition in a Western language so far is the one in Italian recently published by Ricardo Fracasso in 1996.107 The Guideways as we now have it comprises eighteen chapters organized into at least three distinct sections: chapters 1 to 5, which have been called the Guideways through the Five Mountain-Treasuries (Wuzangshanjing) or, more simply, the Guideways through Mountains (Shanjing, plates I–XL);108 chapters 6 to 13, which define areas “beyond the seas” and “within the seas,” later called by some the Guideways through Seas (Haijing, plates XLI–LXIII);109 and the remaining chapters, 14 to 18, which present the “Great
28 INTRODUCTION



Wilds” together with the final chapter, “Guideway through Lands within the Seas” (Haineijing, plates LXIV–LXXVI), which have also been grouped with the second section as part of the Guideways through Seas.110 Based on the most recent count, the text now contains a total of 31,395 graphs in 837 passages.111 The first five chapters, which constitute about half of the book, have a conceptual unity and a coherent linguistic style that suggest that it originally circulated independently. The remaining two sections represent somewhat di erent geographies. They contain some duplication of material and variant versions of information within their chapters, indicating that these sections were less subject to close editorial processing and may have been compiled more haphazardly. Given the preponderance of mythological material throughout the chapters of the Guideways through Seas, including beliefs that can be traced back to the Shang dynasty or that may be even earlier, it would seem that some of the content of these chapters is actually older than the Guideways through Mountains, which most would date to the Warring States period. Strictly speaking, though, the form of the present version can only reliably be dated to the time of Guo Pu.112 The coherence of each chapter of the Guideways derives from the geographical organization of its material, which is arranged to facilitate easy access for reference. The text records a sequence of environmental spheres extending in a given direction each of which usually consists of mountains, bodies of water, or foreign lands. Each sphere is a kind of ecosystem whose strange creatures denote its level of spiritual power. Distinctive topographical features, resident gods and strange creatures, and valuable objects are cataloged in repetitive, formulaic language that may have facilitated memorization and that also conveys a sense of cultural order common to cosmographies. Because traditional Chinese editorial practice primarily valued the preservation and transmission of information from the past, compilers over the centuries often avoided intervening in the text itself to resolve contradictions, repetitions, or variant versions.113 There continue to be intricate scholarly debates over the dating, authorship, and even the demarcation of the three major sections. Moreover, ascribing a single date of compilation to any group of chapters is not necessarily an indication of the origin or age of the information in a particular passage. The known editors and commentators such as Liu Xin, Guo Pu, and Hao Yixing were all later scholars who were removed from the mentality of the Warring States period. They did not travel themselves to personally confirm the geography of the Guideways but sought to recover its meaning through the standard historiographical and philological methods of their times, maintaining the traditional attitude of preservers, transmitters, and correctors of ancient texts. Even modern scholars have basically followed a textual approach, for, in fact, no individual could possibly retrace all the itineraries that are recorded. In the absence of a pre-Qin or original version, readers can therefore only hope to understand the Guideways by reconstructing it as a “virtual text.” This process requires sifting through its many strata with the aid of these commentaries, brushing away the encrustrations of later misreadings, judiciously weighing an abundance of hypothetical interpretations, and trying to recontextualize the early meanings in the light of later knowledge as one would assemble and patch the remaining and sometimes ill-fitting shards of an urn unearthed from an ancient tomb for which there is no other surviving model. Nevertheless, the reader
INTRODUCTION 29



will notice that the e ort to reconstruct an authentic version of the Guideways is constantly undermined by destabilizing linguistic, textual, historical, and cultural factors. With each new reading, some more parts may emerge more distinctly. Others remain embedded in the obscurities of ancient discourses and the accidents of transmission. Still, the world according to the Guideways is predominantly a coherent one, and this fact becomes increasingly revealed as one journeys along its itineraries.
THE WORLD ACCORDING TO THE GUIDEWAYS
The Guideways contains a number of worldviews, from simple creation myths of prehistory to the more systematic paradigms of the Warring States, Qin, and Han philosophers. Fundamentally, it signifies its cosmographical intentions by inscribing a largely natural geography of mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas within the contiguous space of heaven and earth. Among its conceptions regarding heaven is one later known as the “Umbrella-Heaven” theory.114 This was a commonly held belief that heaven is like a rounded cover or canopy supported at key points by sacred mountains above a flat, squared-shaped earth. Chapter 2 records Cleft Mountain in the west, alluding to a myth in which the god Gonggong [no. 314] butted into this pillar of heaven during his power struggle with the thearch Zhuanxu. The mountain was damaged, and the cord tethering heaven to earth snapped. As a result, heaven tilted toward the northwest, which explained why the sun, moon, and stars appear to move there, while a gap was created in the southeast causing that portion of the earth to subside so that many rivers flow in that direction.115 The names of other mountains in the text, such as the Capital City That Supports Heaven, the Celestial Co er at the Northern Extremity, and Lofty Celestial Terrace Mountain, all located in the remote Great Wilds, also suggest the concept of celestial pillars holding up the sky.116 Heaven is referred to here as an amorphous sky zone presided over by the Supreme God Di. One passage notes that it is bureaucratically organized into nine areas and administered by the god Luwu [no. 60], a hybrid deity who is an assistant to Di on Mount Kunlun.117 Several other mountains are similarly presided over by gods who oversee Di’s earthly residences and possessions. In addition to Kunlun, a few special mountains and a particular tree known as the Firm-Tree are identified as places where thearchs and those with special spiritual powers “ascend and descend,” indicating that they are ladders to heaven.118 Heaven can also be reached by a chariot powered by dragons, as in the case of the Xia Sovereign Qi (also called Kai [no. 325]), a shamanic personality and culture hero. Aside from these kinds of figures, though, mobility between heaven and earth is restricted: some sacred places on earth are guarded by fierce creatures, while communication with gods by humans is normally limited to o ering sacrifices or uttering spells. This reflects a myth recorded in the Guideways and elsewhere that the primordial connection between heaven and earth, which once allowed people and gods to intermingle, was deliberately severed in antiquity on command from the thearch Zhuanxu to maintain political order between humans and spiritual creatures.119 These suggestive glimpses into the celestial realm aside, the Guideways is primarily concerned with cataloging strange phenomena on earth. A prefatory statement at the beginning of the Guideways through Seas in chapter 6 states:
30 INTRODUCTION



All that Earth supports within the six directions, encompassed by the four seas, is illuminated by the sun and moon, crossed by the stars and constellations, and marked by the four seasons which are regulated by the Year-Star [i.e., Jupiter]. Things possessing anomalous forms are those born with divine natures. Whether they are long-lived or short, only the sage can understand their ways.120
Earth itself is generally presented in all three sections as an arrangement of flat land masses extending in each of the four directions from a central or inner region. Four seas containing islands entirely surround them with other land masses lying even further beyond. An addendum at the end of the Guideways through Mountains in chapter 5 reveals that the squared shape of earth was actually rectangular when measured. Yu the Great is quoted here as stating that the world measures 28,000 li east to west but only 26,000 li north to south [see no. 214].121 The conception of earth as composed of concentric zones seems to reflect early Chinese cosmic archetypes such as the “magic squares” believed to have been widely known by the fourth century b.c.e. These can be envisioned from such later versions as the Luo River diagram (fig. 6) promoted by early Daoist and other occult philosophers and is said to have been revealed to ancient thearchs such as Fuxi, Yu the Great, or the Yellow Thearch. Its abstract arrangement and numerology based on nine expressed the ideology of political centrality, which later became one of the cosmological underpinnings of the imperial state.122 Such a pattern

is similar to the plan of the Five Dependencies in the “Tributes of Yu” (fig. 7), which was later canonized by the Ru-Confucian tradition as an ideal world order. This presents five outer zones surrounding the capital. The first two outer zones are controlled by the ruler and by royal princes respectively. These are followed by a “pacification zone” ruled by those engaged in spreading the central Chinese culture along with the military, then a zone populated by those barbarian tribes bound to the court by treaty and who are generically called the “Yi” and by the people of the steppes. Finally, surrounding all this is a zone simply termed “the wilds,” which includes the less tractable ManBarbarians and nomads. Each of these areas is measured as extending five hundred li from the borders of the zone within it, making the wilds at their periphery more than five thousand li long on each side.123 Two other geographical coordinates comprise this classic Sinocentric worldview

the Four Seas and the Four Extremities. The former are clearly apparent in the organization of chapters 6 to 13, each presenting a guideway “within the seas,” which is complemented by one “beyond the seas” in each of the four directions. In the distant past, the concept of “seas” may have been more metaphorical, referring to any body of water or even a land mass that lay beyond the limits of the home territory.124 As the local Chinese ethnic cultures expanded and had more direct contact with the oceans to the northeast, east, and south, the term “seas” took on more concrete meaning, while the magical concept of “four” remained more symbolic than real, especially with regard to the “Western Sea.” Here, the vast expanses of sandy deserts were imagined as the liquid “Flowing Sands” or the “Sea of Feathers” left by dessicated birds. The perennial difficulty of extending and maintaining Chinese control over Central Asia made exploration di‹cult and kept geographical knowledge of this direction obscure for centuries. Whether reinforced by faith in the magical number four or supported by travelers’ tales of bodies of water such as the Qinghai Lake, the Aral Sea, or the Indian Ocean, the idea of a Western Sea primarily remained a conceptual reference until much later, when it came to refer to the location of the seas surrounding Europe and America. The “Northern Sea,” on the other hand, was somewhat easier to explain. It could have referred to the bodies of water in the northeast such as the modern bays of Liaodong and Korea or, perhaps, to distant lakes in Mongolia and Siberia. Throughout the Guideways, however, the metaphorical usages of the word “sea” are not distinguished from designations reflecting empirical geographical knowledge. As with the mountains, despite considerable e orts over the centuries, scholars have still not solved many problems surrounding their precise locations. The Four Extremities, which can also be understood sometimes as four poles, mark the ends of the earth and appear in various and sometimes contradictory passages. The most organized sense can be found in the four chapters titled “Guideways to Lands Beyond the Seas,” where powerful gods dwelling at the end of each guideway can be thought of as the rulers of each of these directions: Zhurong in the south, Rushou [no. 74] in the west, Ape-Strength (Yujiang [nos. 253, 329]) in the north, and Goumang [no. 260] in the east. Some of these appear in other Warring States texts, where they are correlated with the Five Agents.125 There are, in addition, myths of other places identified with the idea of a directional extremity such as Mount Celestial Co er at the Northern Extremity mentioned above, described as a place to which the sea flows and enters. Despite the sense of a flat earth with finite ends, there is no real equivalence in the Guideways to the Western concept of terra incognita or any anxiety that one might fall o if one approached the edges of the world. While it was recognized that there were distant places about which not enough was yet known, in the sacred geography of the Guideways, the strange creatures located at greater distances are not any more fantastic or threatening than those nearby. This may reflect the limited degree of early maritime as well as land-based travel in China as well as the improbability that anyone might ever reach such faraway places. Even Yu the Great’s epic itinerary was confined to the area of the Chinese world conventionally known as Under Heaven. The various regions, local cultures, and peoples of early China had not yet evolved a universal conception of themselves as a single Chinese nation except by comparison with surrounding barbarians. Sometimes referring to themselves as the Huaxia peoples,

they looked to more immediate social and political networks such as the ruling houses, their own family genealogies, or their native areas for a primary sense of identity. The Guideways is an early example of a text that propounded the concept of a centrally located Chinese cultural area surrounded by the Four Seas. After the imperial state was established during the Qin-Han period, this was further elaborated and remained the most pervasive worldview throughout the history of traditional China. Until the late nineteenth century, when the pressure of Japanese imperialism necessitated a more realistic understanding of world geography, the Four Seas were widely depicted in maps, especially in a genre known as China and the Barbarians. The earliest extant version of

this is a well-known stone engraving from 1136 that may represent earlier traditions.126 A notable characteristic of Chinese cartography is the integration of traditional cultural information derived from texts and empirical data. This integration was not only reflected in the design of the map but also in extensive colophons written around and within it. The Guideways continued to be a major source of such cultural information about distant foreign lands up until the late nineteenth century. An example can be seen in a map published in 1613 titled “General Map of the Four Seas, China, and the Barbarians” (Sihai huayi zongtu, fig. 8).127 This is a sacred geography of the Buddhist continent of Jambùdvìpa from Korea in the east to Persia in the west though with China given greater centrality and India in the south correspondingly reduced. This map had a primarily conceptual function, and some places from the Guideways are represented among the islands in the seas and on the land masses beyond the seas. Even an o‹cial map as late as “The Great Qing Dynasty’s Complete Map of All Under Heaven” (Daqing yitong tianxia quantu, 1819) records similar information in both its design and in colophons.128 Each of the three sections of the Guideways presents a slightly di erent geography within the Umbrella-Heaven, Four Seas, and Four Extremities frameworks. The first five chapters comprising the Guideways through Mountains present what appears to be a known, finite world of five zones of mountains arranged in the order of south, west, north, east, and center.129 If represented pictorially, these appear similar to a “magic square” pattern (fig. 9). Each chapter in the Guideways through Mountains charts from three to as many as twelve separate strings of mountains or “guideways,” making twenty-six in all, with the most extensive treatment given to the Central Mountains. In 1982, the mainland Chinese scholar Wang Chengzu attempted to map these guideways based on indications

in the text such as proximity to major rivers (fig. 10). They do not reflect a geological concept of mountain ranges, and the text does not indicate the relationship between each one, only the direction they individually follow such as from west to east. Although the distances between each mountain are measured, little further indication is given as to the exact route a traveler might take from one to the other, for, as in other sacred cosmographies, much depends on the spiritual vision of the traveler. The primary unity underlying each guideway appears to be religious rather than topographical, for there is no material basis for a particular string of mountains except that each is ruled over by a distinct group of resident gods. Described at the end of each guideway, these usually share a similar appearance requiring the same set of sacrifices. For example, the gods along the ten mountains of the first guideway through the Southern Mountains all have bird bodies with dragon heads. The proper sacrifice to them is a hairy animal with o erings of glutinous rice, unhulled rice, and burial of a jade blade and disc. The ceremony uses mats of white rushes. A few of the places described are recognizable landmarks, but most of the mountains recorded still have not been convincingly identified by scholars, and the distances indicated are usually inaccurate by modern measurement, often considerably so. Though the compilers endeavored to include a certain amount of factual information, the large number of unconfirmed places has always posed a problem for later readers. It is improbable that any individual or group could have traveled to chart all the sites recorded in even one chapter of the Guideways, and it is doubtful that any early Chinese map that may have been consulted provided such detailed information about all these places. Thus, compilers may well have indulged their imaginations to fill in the vast spaces between recognizable points, a practice by no means unknown in the travel writing and geographies of other premodern cultures.130 Similar problems occur with the names and courses of the many rivers, not to mention the relationship of the land masses to the Four Seas. Chapter 4 describes mountains in the east that can be recognized as largely located in the Shandong peninsula; yet it contains the least detailed descriptions and some of the most exaggerated distances. The twelve guideways in chapter 5 recording the Central Mountains are the most abundant and extend from the Yellow River all the way to the Long River. As might be expected, the information becomes even more distorted as one moves to the peripheries, especially the distant south and west. It is noteworthy that the Guideways does not mention the Five Marchmounts, although such groupings were already promoted in some early texts as the most important sacred mountains.131 Only four of these mountains are briefly listed, and of these, only Lotus Mountain (Huashan) [see no. 34] in the west is considered a particularly important mountain whose gods require the highest level of sacrifice.132 Even more curiously, the Supreme Mountain (Taishan) [see no. 143] in the east, which some of the fangshi-wizards and others promoted as the preeminent sacred mountain, is described inaccurately without suggesting any extraordinary distinction.133 Yet despite this high degree of fabrication, the inclusion of measured distances between the mountains suggests that the Guideways was seriously intended to be consulted for practical purposes. This basic geographical concept of a string of mountains is consistent with some of the earliest surviving Chinese maps, particularly one excavated from a tomb at Mawangdui (modern Changsha, Hunan) dating before 168 b.c.e.

that records topographic features, settlements, and military garrisons in the southern part of the Western Han state of Changsha (fig. 11) in the former state of Chu.134 All the mountains are consistently presented as lofty zones devoid of human habitation. The geography of the Guideways is a natural, sacred, and esoteric one with virtually no mention of feudal states, towns, cities, districts, provinces, or other political divisions.135 In the Guideways through Mountains, only the rivers emanating from each mountain indicate a connection with the world below. These are primarily presented as outflows of the divine essence of the peaks that eventually disappear into larger rivers, lakes, or the surrounding seas. Occasionally, the unique physical appearance of a mountain is described and a sense of hierarchy indicated, reflecting the divine power of the place and its concentration of strange things. Such special status usually determines the magnitude of the sacrifices required. Most are simply referred to as “mountain” (shan). However, a few, such as Greater Lotus Mountain [see no. 34], are also accorded a higher status as a “sacred summit” (zhong), where many gods dwell, or as a “divine peak” (shen),

where a lesser number or just a single god dwells. Several others, including Mount Kunlun, are denoted as “great peaks” (qiu) while Bear Mountain is called a di and presumably associated with the Supreme God Di or a thearch.136 A further set of distinctions can be made between those mountains that are directly connected with the Supreme God Di or a thearch, those with resident mountain gods requiring sacrifices, and others where lesser gods and strange creatures dwell more anonymously. An example of the style of the Guideways through Mountains from the third guideway through the Western Mountains in chapter 2 records Mount Kunlun, one of the major sites in ancient Chinese mythology. It is given the most detailed description of any mountain in the book, suggesting that the Guideways primarily reflects religious traditions that considered this place as the axis mundi:137
Four hundred li southwest [of Sophora River Mountain] is Mount Kunlun. It is actually the earthly capital of the Supreme God Di. The god Luwu [no. 60] administers it. His divine form resembles a tiger’s body with nine tails, a human face, and tiger’s claws. This god administers the nine regions of heaven as well as the cycle of four seasons in the Supreme God’s garden. There is an animal here with the form of a goat but with four horns called the Tulou [no. 61] that devours men. There is a bird here with the form of a bee, as large as a mandarin duck called the Qinyuan [no. 62]. If it stings a bird or animal, it dies; if it stings a tree, it withers. There is a bird here called the Quail-Bird, which is in charge of Di’s stored treasures. There is a tree here similar to the pear with yellow blossoms and red fruits with the taste of a plum but without pits called the Sand-Pear. It can protect against floods, and eating it can prevent drowning. There is a plant here called the Pin-Plant whose form resembles a sunflower but with the taste of a scallion. Eating it will alleviate fatigue. The Yellow River emanates from here and flows south, then east to Never-Reach River. The Red River emanates from here and flows southeast into the River That Floods Heaven. The Oceanic River emanates from here and flows southwest into the Ugly Mire River. The Black River emanates from here and flows west into the Dayu River. Here, there are many strange birds and animals.138
The worldviews of the two remaining sections, composed of chapters 6 to 13 and 14 to 18, are closer to one another and di er from that of the Guideways through Mountains in some important respects. In contrast to a finite world of four zones surrounding a central one, the other groups of chapters are based on a more dualistic geography, though one that still reflects the “magic square” pattern. In every direction, an inner zone regarded as closer to or within the known world is separated by a sea from another regarded as located outside or beyond it. Thus, each of the chapters designated as “beyond the seas” (chaps. 6–9) is complemented by a chapter “within the seas” (chaps. 10–13). Similarly, the four chapters of the “Great Wilds” (chaps. 14–17) are complemented by the final chapter 18, “Guideway through Lands within the Seas.”139 The location of a zone of civilized Chinese culture at the very center remains implicit in these two other worldviews, which may be represented as shown in figures 12 and 13.
INTRODUCTION 39



Despite the later, collective title of Guideways through Seas, which some have used to designate these two sections, the sections deal relatively little with the Four Seas themselves. Instead, they focus on the strange creatures dwelling on land, including islands with the outer limits of the world marked by the Four Extremities. Each chapter presents only one guideway whose route is tenuously drawn through vast spaces lacking a consistent topography. In these strings, one environmental sphere simply appears after another with no measurement of the distances between them. There are few verifiable places, nor does the text catalogue similar groups of valuable objects as if they might be available to the traveler. Bizarre foreign tribes abound, and everything noted employs a high level of mythological description. A typical example is from chapter 17, “Guideway through the Great Wilds to the North”:

There is a Land of the Pendant-Ears People [no. 328]. They are surnamed Ren, are the descendants of Ape-Howl (Yuhao), and eat grains. On an island in the Northern Sea is a god with a human face and a bird’s body who wears two green snakes through his ears and treads on two red snakes. He is named Yujiang (Ape-Strength) [no. 329]. In the Great Wilds to the North is a mountain called Celestial-Co er-at-theNorthern-Extremity. The sea flows northward into it. There is a god with nine heads, human faces, and a bird’s body named Nine-Headed Feng-Bird [no. 330]. There is also a god here who bites hold of snakes and grasps snakes. His form resembles a tiger’s head on a human body with four hooves and long arms. His name is Jiangliang (Strong-and-Good) [no. 331]. In the Great Wilds is a mountain called The Capital City That Supports

Heaven. There is a person with two yellow snakes through his ears who holds two yellow snakes in his hands named Kuafu the Boaster [no. 247]. Lord Earth begat Trust (Xin) and Trust begat Kuafu. Kuafu overestimated his power and wanted to chase the sun’s shadow and catch it in Ape Valley. He went to drink in the Yellow River, but the water was not enough so he wanted to go to the Grand Lake but died before reaching it. Winged-Dragon [no. 305] had already killed Chiyou and then killed Kuafu. Afterward, he went to dwell in the south and for that reason, there is much rain in the south.140
In addition to all these geographical frameworks, several other patterns suggest further levels of world organization. One is color. Early Chinese texts identified a group of five principal colors—blue/green, red, white, black, and yellow—as having broad ritual significance, and these were gradually correlated with other systematized phenomena such as the Five Directions in Five Agents cosmology. In the Guideways, mountains, bodies of water, strange creatures, and unusual flora are often described in terms of the Five Colors. These may be present individually, in combinations, or in total. Places or things that are white, the color correlated with the west, are the most numerous, followed by red (south), blue/green (east), yellow (center), and black (north). This pattern seems to confirm the primary mythological focus of the Guideways on the west and south. Sometimes a creature may be described as exhibiting two or more of these colors simultaneously to emphasize its strangeness. A special category of potent creatures are described as “five-colored” to indicate an extraordinarily high degree of spiritual power. In a few cases, there may be a correspondence between a color and a concept based on homophony.141 Still, the precise iconographical significance of each color is rarely clear and may reflect empirical logic, arbitrary application, or esoteric beliefs that have been lost. Another set of cosmic patterns is numerological, with special numbers having magical significance. Three appears most frequently, followed by five, four, and nine, and there are scattered usages of other numbers as well. Nine, as the highest signifier of multiplicity, is reserved for things or beings of particular potency. The nine gates of Mount Kunlun, the nine heads of Minister Liu/You [no. 244], the Nine-Tail Fox [no. 257], and the Nine-Headed Feng-Bird [no. 330] are particularly awesome, fierce, or dominant forms. In a few cases, a number seems to suggest a mystical connection between strange creatures and a place, as in the case of Three-Dangers Mountain [see no. 71] that is home to the triple-bodied Chi-Bird [no. 72], the Three Green-Birds [no. 276], and also associated with the Three-Sprouts People as the site of their exile. In most cases, though, the precise intention behind specific numerological designations, as with colors, remains unclear. Last, a sense of hierarchical order is suggested by relationships between certain strange creatures. These may be genealogical, bureaucratic, or symbolic or involve domination through military conflict. Some of these relationships are based on older shamanistic practices or ancestral cults or reflect the evolution of a bureaucratized pantheon based on human political ideals. A noteworthy pattern involves a relationship between a dominant creature and snakes, dragons, and birds. In many ancient religions, a primordial level of belief centered around certain terrestrial creatures whose domain
42 INTRODUCTION



included the underground and the afterlife. Snakes, in particular, inspired dread, not only for their potentially poisonous e ects on the living but also because they were believed to consume the bodies of the dead. Subsequent phases of belief envisioned more powerful deities who were shown to control snakes and who o ered believers some reassurance in higher cosmic powers. In the Guideways, a number of potent figures who may be gods or divine shamans are described as grasping snakes, wearing snakes through their ears, or treading on snakes, and these snakes are usually described in terms of symbolic colors as well. An example is the god Strong-and-Good [no. 331], who bites down on one snake and grasps two others. Other powers that can control snakes are divine birds such as the Yellow-Birds [no. 308] who dwell at Shaman Mountain and who control the Black-Snakes [no. 307] nearby. The latter are described as gluttonous eaters of deer, but more important, they are located close to this mountain where the divine herbs of the Supreme God Di are found. Here, “yellow” (huang) may be homophonous with “imperial” or “high god” (huang), so these are probably sacred birds who are o‹cials of Di himself.142 All these patterns of world organization in the Guideways constitute an e ort by the compilers to define an intelligible sacred order as existing within a vast, largely unknown natural world. This e ort is further reinforced by defining a typology of the strange creatures to indicate that their manifestly diverse natures embody certain generic characteristics.
THE TYPOLOGY OF THE STRANGE
The more than five hundred strange creatures of the Guideways represent the beliefs of di erent historical periods as well as of various local cultures. In cosmographical fashion, they are displayed along the spatial axes of the three main worldviews without any attempt to clearly distinguish their individual origins. With the exception of a relatively few figures who are physically identified as humans, the overwhelming majority are hybrids composed of a basic form, to which additional features have been added. Although hybrid deities can be traced back to far earlier periods, they appear to have particularly flourished in China during the Warring States, only to later decline in popular veneration. Some modern scholars have interpreted their features as indicating a shamanistic ability to travel across the gulf between heaven and earth to communicate with higher gods. Others have regarded the hybrid form as reflecting the identification of ancient humankind with the animal world or as simply a transitional form during the gradual transformation of early animal gods into more anthropomorphic figures.143 There are very few instances in Chinese mythology of a biological basis for these combinations, however. Unlike some figures in other cultures, such as the Minotaur, these are rarely the result of genetic inheritance or crossbreeding. With few exceptions, neither humans nor animals are indicated as having had sexual relations with gods or one another. Some foreign tribes claim descent from ancient Chinese thearchs, especially the Yellow Thearch, but this fact does not account for the origin of their odd physical characteristics. Even the genealogies of various Dog Peoples [see no. 278], who often claim a dog and a human ancestor, are not mentioned here. Rather, the strange creatures of the Guideways predominantly exist as modular constructions whose components may or may not have been assembled according to an underlying logic.
INTRODUCTION 43



The more rational philosophical schools of this period articulated the natures of things based on their membership in a category often defined by similar physical or behavorial characteristics. Cognition was seen as a process of correct classification based on recognizing the essential features in each thing that associated it with the appropriate group of similar objects. This understanding was prerequisite to maintaining the proper interaction among things and to the exercising of e ective human control over the cosmos. Some of the major thinkers during this period such as Confucius regarded the breakdown of the political order as a failure to maintain these patterns in cognition and in language, resulting in widespread unethical social behavior. From this normalizing viewpoint, strange creatures, by definition, were seen as violating these commonly established categories, and the hybrid particularly exemplified this by the excess as well as by the apparent incommensurability of its multiple features. In the Guideways, a hybrid creature is usually described formulaically. First, it may be classified as a member of a broader species such as god, human, beast, bird, fish, and so on. Then it is said to have a bodily form that resembles a known animal to which are then added additional, unexpected characteristics. For example, Luwu [no. 60] is described as a god whose body resembles that of a tiger but with nine tails, a human face, and tiger’s claws and the Huantou People [no. 217] as a people with human faces, wings, and birds’ beaks. Six principal patterns in the morphogenesis of these hybrids have been identified: first, generic transformation in which a familiar creature is altered by the addition of unusual characteristics, as in the case of the Lei [no. 10], a wildcat that has a mane and is hermaphroditic; second, multiplication of normal features, as in the Boshi [no. 11], a goat with nine tails and four ears; third, reduction of normal features, as in the Huan [no. 23], a goat without a mouth; fourth, a combination of two or more animals, such as the Zhi-Pig [no. 21], who has the form of a tiger with the tail of an ox and who makes a sound like a dog; fifth, alternate placement of features, as in the Paoxiao [no. 118], whose eyes are under its armpits; and last, those creatures who undergo divine transformation, such as Drum [no. 55], who originally had a dragon’s body with a human face but was executed. He then metamorphosed into a Jun-Bird, resembling an owl with red feet, a straight beak, yellow markings, a white head and makes a sound like a swan. In this taxonomy of hybridization, no matter how fantastic the combination or transformation, the essential components are all known forms existing in the natural or human worlds rather than imaginative fabrications.144 Despite their bizarre appearances, most of the hybrid creatures of the Guideways are not monsters in the ancient Greek or medieval European sense. That is, they are not primordial powers that must be overcome by virtuous gods or heroes for human civilization to progress. Admittedly, a few such as Winged-Dragon [no. 305] serve the Supreme God Di and help him to maintain cosmic stability by crushing rebels such as Chiyou. However, most legitimately dwell in the environment alongside humankind and simply represent another, overlapping order with its own principles. Composite forms of modular construction have a long history in China, for example, in the manufacturing process of early bronze vessels or in such figures as the Taotie animal mask.145 Yet the proliferation of the hybrid during the latter part of the Zhou dynasty can also be seen to embody a certain kind of cultural logic particular to the age. The definition of a strange creature as a core identity plus additional features mirrors
44 INTRODUCTION



the pluralistic nature of the feudal state and appears to correspond to an important historical development in the Chinese script. On the one hand, it reflects a concept of superior power through an aggregation of elements rather than through synthesis or evolution. In the centuries-long process of military consolidation, the strongest states usually expanded through the piecemeal conquest of adjacent territories, and this process was often facilitated by polygamous marriages by the rulers as well as by religious syncretism. Totalization was thus achieved through sheer multiplicity. Each state was, therefore, composed of a core local culture in a home territory to which additional, somewhat alien territories were added in accretions, like a hybrid creature with a basic bodily form and additional physical characteristics. These newly acquired territories, which sometimes passed back and forth between contenders many times, were not rapidly assimilated into the home culture, and unless the population was wiped out or exiled, many local cultures continued to maintain their particularity. One may say that each major state was faced with reconciling the increasing quality of “strangeness” to itself as it expanded and annexed culturally di erent appendages. The state of Chu, for example, was among the most successful in practicing this kind of cultural aggregation in which Shang and Zhou elements from the Central Plains coexisted with the more “barbarian” influences of the Ba-Shu, Man, Yi, and Wu-Yue peoples, among others, resulting in a more complex sense of identity. Simultaneously, in the written language, there was a rapid expansion of the category of graphs later called xiesheng (phonetic compounds) that represent a composite method of signification. These were designed to accommodate new distinctions in language and thought to reflect more complex cultural realities and to avoid semantic ambiguity due to the large number of homonyms. The new forms were created by adding either a semantic or phonetic determinative to an existing, primary graph. The determinatives, especially the phonetic ones, were themselves often composed of several other graphs. The resultant “multibodied” graphs enabled the language to gain greater versatility and achieve a wider range of written expression within its fundamentally logographic nature. For example, adding to the phonetic element ˆ (pronounced mo) the semantic determinative ‚ (hand; shou) created the graph ± (mo) meaning “to rub,” adding • (words; yan) created ” (to announce; mo), while adding ® (horse; ma) created Z (mo; to prance). The phonetic compound ˆ, which literally means “dark,” “obscure” and by extension “no,” “none” or “nothing,” is itself composed of three graphs stacked vertically: Û (grass; cao, in its later, combined form as h) on top, È (sun; ri) in the middle, and again Û below (later simplified into the graph j da or “big”) and defined in the dictionary Explanations and Analyses of Graphs as “the sun amidst [i.e., obscured by] the grass.” However, these meanings are not operative when ˆ functions as a phonetic. As the final stage in the development of the Chinese script, phonetic compounds presented virtually unlimited possibilities for the invention of new graphs and facilitated a system of indexing widely used in dictionaries. Like the expansion of the feudal states, this method of composite construction with determinatives closely resembles the aggregation of additional physical features to the basic form of a strange creature.146 Several reasons may account for why the representation of hybrid creatures later declined. First, the creation of a centralized state during the Qin and Han dynasties grad
INTRODUCTION 45



ually consolidated many diverse, local cultural forms into a more unified national culture that was eventually able to assert greater priority over those of the earlier feudal states. With the successful establishment of Confucianism throughout the bureaucracy in the course of the Han dynasty, the hybrid creatures of the Guideways were less compelling a reality to many elite readers. Second, the intense ideological focus of the imperial state on the person of the emperor supported the historicization of mythology, which transformed hybrid gods and thearchs into more humanized “sage-kings” for use as political and ethical models, a process that had begun at least as early as the Zhou dynasty and is already observable in the Guideways. Third, the rise of new religions such as Daoism and Buddhism, with their individualistic, soteriological goals also promoted humanoid deities as supreme powers in comparison to which the ancient hybrid gods appeared less universal and iconographically more idiosyncratic. The humanoid gods, however, by no means achieved a complete victory. In response to continuing popular belief, some hybrids were subordinated as lower gods or recast as fierce guardians of higher powers in the pantheons of the new religions, while others continued their existence in various popular cults. Some new ones even continued to emerge in later periods. The hybrid figure as the archetypal representation of the strange was thus appropriate to the general cognitive level of the Warring States. It clearly contrasts with the more rational patterns of organization envisioned in encyclopedic and cosmographical texts that sought to map out a centralized Chinese state based on concepts of human moral authority. To a certain extent, the Guideways itself embodies the contradiction exemplified by the disparity between the manifest order of its geographical form and the random spatial distribution and strangeness of its inhabitants. One of its primary methods of containment from within the society of strange creatures is the superimposition of a divine imperial government of thearchs and their o‹cials presided over by a supreme god.
The Supreme God Di
Chief among the strange creatures in the Guideways are the gods, who may be divided into two types: the Supreme God Di, who rules the entire cosmos from heaven, and a host of lesser, earthly gods generically denoted as shen, who reside at specific mountains, rivers, and in foreign lands.147 Di is mentioned as early as the Shang dynasty oracle-bone inscriptions as the chief god and ancestor of the royal house, though recently it has been questioned whether the name refers to an individual progenitor or to any one of a class of high gods, all of whom may have been regarded as forebears.148 Throughout the three sections of the Guideways, di erent presentations of Di create further ambiguity about his identity. On the one hand, in the Guideways through Mountains, Di is not physically described and appears as a rather distant figure who rules imperially from heaven with the aid of some of the shen-gods functioning as his o‹cials on earth. Although he has connections with special mountains, which he directly possesses like royal fiefs, Di himself never appears and is only recorded as intervening in the world to maintain order by punishing lesser gods and other figures who murder or rebel. In these descriptions, he is similar to the Supreme God Di in other Zhou texts
46 INTRODUCTION



who was transformed to some extent from the Shang royal ancestor into a more abstract ruling deity.149 On the other hand, other chapters of the Guideways also denote as Di a group of thearchs who may be identified by name such as the Yellow Thearch, Flame Thearch (Yandi), Lesser-Brilliance (Shaohao), Greater-Brilliance (Taihao), Zhuanxu, Thearch Jun (Dijun), Yao, Shun, and Yu the Great [no. 345]. Elsewhere in Chinese mythology, some of these are described as hybrids but here they are not described physically and seem to have already become historicized as humanoid figures who preside over divine bureaucracies and have finite lives in time. Many of them, as noted in the text, lie buried in tombs on earth. Like terrestrial rulers, they may struggle militarily for their position as Supreme God, sometimes against one another and sometimes against rebellious challengers. According to some theories, most of these thearchs were regarded as ancestors of various local ethnic groups, and they continued to be worshiped by ruling houses of the Warring States. Lesser-Brilliance and probably Thearch Jun, for example, were progenitive figures among eastern tribes dwelling in and around modern Shandong province who were sometimes referred to by the more centrally located Chinese as the “YiBarbarians.”150 Both the ruling houses of the states of Qin and Chu claimed descent from Zhuanxu. Some of these, such as Thearch Jun, were evidently once important but later disappeared from o‹cial pantheons probably because of the military decline and cultural assimilation of their worshipers. Gradually, the Yellow Thearch, a comparatively later figure in mythology, who may originally have been a thunder god or a dragonsnake figure, emerged as the dominant thearch representing the center in Five Agents cosmology. By the Western Han, the Yellow Thearch, along with several other thearchs, were incorporated into the orthodox genealogy of Chinese civilization promoted by the imperial state and, by the Eastern Han, he was further elevated as the supreme god of the Daoist pantheon.151 In the works of the philosophers and early historians, the thearchs as sage-kings exemplified various paradigms of moral and political behavior, but in the Guideways, they are more ambiguously defined as powerful, divine beings. Essentially, they are still strange creatures of a higher order who maintain their authority through warfare and punishment in varying and sometimes contradictory myths. An important level of organization among the thearchs is created by delineating genealogies of these and other divine figures, some of whom are culture bearers. One example of this is from chapter 16:
Thearch Jun begat Lord Millet (Houji), who bestowed the hundred kinds of grain on mankind. Lord Millet’s younger brother was called Taixi, who begat Shujun. Shujun carried on from his father and Lord Millet by disseminating the hundred grains and invented agriculture.152
It is generally thought that such genealogies represent a later phase of ancient Chinese mythology, though it is not clear how they originated or what exactly they signify. These lineages may represent organizations of various cults to reflect social and political changes. Or they may have evolved as a mnemonic device in an orally transmitted mythology. It is characteristic of the Guideways that these genealogies usually di er from those in other Warring States texts, while many of the myths recorded about the thearchs
INTRODUCTION 47



here are also unique among the surviving examples of early Chinese literature.153 Despite attempts by both traditional commentators and modern scholars to correlate the impersonal Supreme God Di with the individualized thearchs and relate them to other early texts, the persistent ambiguity not only reflects the multiple sources of the Guideways but also the fluidity of the concept of Di in antiquity.154 In the translated captions to these illustrations, therefore, the presentation of Di follows the style of the particular passage in the original text.
Gods (Shen)
The shen-gods are a far more diverse group, most of whom function as nature deities rooted in specific places. They exist on several levels of organization, though many are simply individual anomalies. A few are cosmic embodiments who physically personify natural phenomena. Torch-Dragon [no. 336], also called Torch-Darkness, brings nighttime when he closes his eyes and daylight when he opens them, while the winter and summer seasons are caused by his breathing. Dijiang [no. 73] is a yellow sack who glows like fiery cinnabar, and some commentators have interpreted his body as the undi erentiated cosmos in a primordial state of chaos. The God of Thunder [no. 295] is a dragon who causes thunder by using his stomach as a drum. Other shen-gods are represented as the resident spirits of specific places. Among the more prominent of these are Bingyi [no. 290], god of the Yellow River; the Two Daughters of the Supreme God Di [no. 214], who are goddesses of the Xiao and Xiang rivers in the Grotto Lake area; and the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275], who is located on her own mountain. Another group functions as divine bureaucrats, and its members are early examples of a practice common to later Chinese religion in which diverse gods are arranged in pantheons that ideally mirror the structure of the human government on earth. Each set of mountain gods at the end of the individual guideways in the Guideways through Mountains requires specific sacrifices appropriate to their status, like local o‹cials demanding taxes and other payments. In addition to the gods associated with various directions at the end of each of the “Guideways beyond the Seas,” there are gods of the winds mentioned in the chapters on the “Great Wilds”: Zhedan in the east, Yinyinhu in the south, Shiyi in the northwest, and Wan/Yan in the northeast.155 Furthermore, there are Yujiang (Ape-Strength) [nos. 253, 329] and Yuhao (Ape-Howl) [see no. 328], gods of the North and East Seas, respectively. Besides Luwu [no. 60], several other gods are specifically identified as o‹cials directly serving the Supreme God Di who oversee his earthly possessions on particular mountains. There are also military subordinates of thearchs or rebels who are called into action in the course of epic power struggles, such as Winged-Dragon [no. 305], Xingtian [no. 233], Minister Liu/You [no. 244], the Master of Rain, and the Lord of Wind [for both, see no. 332].156 A notable feature of some gods is their ability to metamorphose. In later Chinese religion, this power is often represented as a definitive attribute of divinity and one of the highest achievements of spiritual cultivation. Here, however, it is not yet conceived of as a process of transcendence but rather occurs as a result of traumatic events. Drum [no. 55] and Qinpi [no. 56] change into birds after being executed by the Supreme God, as does the divine princess Spirit-Guardian [no. 133] after she drowns. Xingtian [no.

233] grows new eyes and a mouth after being decapitated. None of the gods appears to be immortal. Several su er death through conflict, while the gravesites of others are specifically noted. The remaining strange creatures constitute an unorganized panoply of unique figures whose appearances, powers, and domiciles vary greatly. They are by far the most numerous and are found in all the chapters of the Guideways. Most are like the Bo [nos. 82, 251]—independent, hybrid creatures dwelling in the natural environment who may have beneficial or harmful consequences for humans. In general, the distinction between the shen-gods and these lower creatures is not always clear, for both kinds may be classified in the text as humans, beasts, birds, snakes, fish, animals with shells, or turtles.
Challengers and Criminals. The Supreme God Di and the thearchs, along with their subordinates, represent a divine political order that is sometimes threatened by challengers. The Guideways records a number of myths in which these figures are forced to protect their status though military means. Primordial, epic-scale battles for control, such as those between the Yellow Thearch and his younger brother, the Flame Thearch, and, subsequently, between the Yellow Thearch and the god Chiyou, are played out on earthly battlefields and involve a cast of lesser figures. It is possible that some of these power struggles may have originated in prehistoric wars between tribes whose totems were personified mythologically as prototypes of the thearchs. The Three-Sprouts People [see nos. 71, 218, 313, 335] and the Youyi People [see no. 300] are noted as having been exiled by the Supreme God at some point to the periphery as a result of such conflicts. Among the other major struggles are those between Yu the Great and Gonggong [no. 314], personifier of the Deluge, which also involved execution of the latter’s o‹cial, Minister Liu/You. While some of these figures su er death or exile, not all are utterly suppressed. Xingtian not only regenerated himself after being decapitated but continues to dance defiantly with shield and battle-ax. Others are pardoned by sympathetic thearchs and relocated to distant areas. A lesser category of challengers are those who resist the powers of nature and who su er for their hubris. Kuafu the Boaster [no. 247], in the most well-known myth about him, is a Chinese Icarus who chases after the sun and dies of thirst before he can overcome it, though in another account, he appears to be associated with Chiyou and is killed by Winged-Dragon. Spirit-Guardian, like Kuafu, has also been revived in recent decades in mainland China as a heroic resister. A daughter of the Flame Thearch, she drowned in the Eastern Sea and metamorphosed into a bird seeking eternal revenge by carrying twigs and stones from the Western Mountains to fill up the Eastern Sea. Then there are criminals who murder others, apparently for political reasons, and who are suitably punished by the justice of the Supreme God. Drum, the god of Bell Mountain, killed Baojiang with the help of Qinpi [see no. 55]. Erfu [no. 281], with the help of his minister, Wei [no. 268], killed Yayu [nos. 265, 270], for which the minister was punished by having his right leg fettered and his hands and hair tied behind him to a tree on a mountain. There are several heroic figures who carry out this divine justice. Yi the Archer, for example, killed a demonic creature called Chiseled-Teeth [see no. 224]
INTRODUCTION 49



who was oppressing the common people east of Mount Kunlun and in another myth pacified the warring feudal states with a vermilion bow and white arrows given him by Thearch Jun. Zhurong [nos. 227, 345], a god of fire, has a dual identity. In one passage, he is a descendant of the Flame Thearch and the father of Gonggong, who is banished to the Long River area. Elsewhere, he is also the executioner of Gun, the father of Yu the Great, who was killed on orders of the Supreme God for having stolen the Expanding Soil in a failed e ort to curb the Deluge. All these events reflect the recurrent political turbulence of the Chinese cosmos. Such conflicts are represented as impersonal power struggles, and the killing is usually noted without detailed descriptions of bloodshed.
Culture Heroes. In China, as elsewhere, a number of gods were credited as culture heroes who bestowed civilization on humankind. In later ages, these attributions tended to become consolidated around several of the orthodox thearchs, but in the Guideways, they are more widely distributed among various divine creatures, some of whom subsequently vanished from mythology. Creativity seems to run in the family, for one finds sons carrying on the work of fathers, as Yu the Great did for Gun, or lineages of gods who each invented something. Among the thearchs, Thearch Jun is credited with siring the most inventors, including Lord Millet, the spreader of agriculture; Fanyu, inventor of boats; Auspicious-Light (Jiguang), inventor of carriages; Feast-Dragon (Yanlong), inventor of zithers; and Artisan Chui (Qiaochui), who invented handicrafts. Eight other sons of his are said to have invented song and dance. Lord Millet himself is part of an illustrious nuclear family, for his younger brother Taixi and nephew Shujun both were active in further disseminating the cultivation of grains among humankind. Some of these figures may have acted as shamanic intermediaries. The Xia Sovereign Kai (Qi) [nos. 228, 325] journeyed between heaven and earth to receive sacred dances and music directly from the Supreme God Di, as narrated in the following passage:
Beyond the Southwest Sea, south of the Red River and west of the Desert of Shifting Sands, is a man who wears two green snakes through his ears and rides on two dragons, named the Xia Sovereign Kai. Kai ascended to heaven three times as a guest and obtained “The Nine Arguments” (Jiubian) and “The Nine Songs,” which he brought down when he descended. At this place called the Plain of Celestial Majesty, two thousand ren high, he first sang “The Nine Summons” (Jiuzhao).157
The Xia Sovereign Kai (trad. r. c. 1978–1965 b.c.e.), whose name was changed in the Han from Qi to avoid the personal name of Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 b.c.e.), was the son of the thearch Yu the Great and was historicized as the second ruler of the Xia dynasty. In mythology, he was born when his mother metamorphosed into a stone out of fright and then broke open upon his father’s command—hence his names, both of which mean “to open.” Here he appears as a shaman ascending to heaven with the aid of potent creatures. These performance pieces were among the sacred music of heaven, and the first two have been related etymologically to songs and dances of supplication for rain. Versions of this myth in other sources state that Kai actually stole them before descending. Thus, he may be regarded as a trickster figure as well as a culture hero who brought an important religious practice to humankind.158

Cures and Omens. In addition to such culture heroes, the Guideways describes a number of far stranger creatures who can bring benefit or harm to humans. Some are simply described as man-eaters, but generally they can also be used for two purposes: as medicinal cures or as omens. Those creatures who have beneficial powers can be eaten, or a part of them can be worn in contact with the body. Parts of others can be made into talismans to be worn from the belt, and a few provide protection if domesticated. Sometimes these practices reflect magical beliefs, as in the case of the Lei [no. 10] who is hermaphroditic and whose flesh, if eaten, can cure jealousy. Such medicinal properties are also possessed by some plants, trees, and minerals. These types of treatments are more preventative than curative and are considered e ective in three areas: physical ailments, psychological conditions, and environmental hazards, including war. Knowledge of natural medicine was partially absorbed into the practices of the yi-physicians, while still remaining an area of expertise associated with wu-shamans.159 As an authoritative omen catalogue, the Guideways enabled any literate person to o er an informed opinion on the identity and meaning of such appearances, for the sighting of an omen was interpreted as a sign of heaven’s will reflecting either approval of the conduct of government or displeasure over the ruler’s lack of virtue.160 The Guideways records more than fifty creatures whose presence could be beneficial or harmful. Most of these are found in the first five chapters and are classified as beasts, followed by birds, fish, snakes, and shen-gods. The extent of their e ects may be worldwide or limited to the feudal state, to commanderies and prefectures, or to a city. The vast majority of these events are evil, the most common ones being drought, floods, war, epidemics, panic, forced labor, and violent winds. Less common are the exile of scholars, general calamity, the arrival of cunning visitors, locusts, fire, and general destruction. A minority of creatures, though, are beneficial, harbingers of such things as an abundant harvest, land reclamation, and peace.161 The Mottled Flying-Fish [no. 57] is a typical example found in the Observation River along the third guideway through the Western Mountains:
Its form resembles a carp with a fish’s body, bird’s wings, blue-black markings, a white head, and a red mouth. It often courses in the Western Sea and swims to the Eastern Sea. The Mottled Flying-Fish flies by night and makes a sound like a LuanChicken. It has a sweet-and-sour taste. Eating it will cure insanity. If seen by people, it is an omen of a bountiful harvest throughout the world.162
Wu-Shamans. The Guideways contains a number of passages that make it the greatest single source of information about wu-shamans among surviving texts from ancient China. Most of these passages appear in chapters about the west and south, where one finds several mountains with names like Shaman Mountain (Wushan; also Lingshan). One such place serves as a refuge for the Corpse of Geng of the Xia [no. 323], a headless challenger still brandishing a spear and shield who was decapitated by Tang the Founder (r.c. 1557–1546 b.c.e.) in one of the battles to establish the Shang dynasty.163 Another passage in chapter 15, “Guideway through the Great Wilds in the South,” states:
INTRODUCTION 51



There is Shaman Mountain. On its western side are found the Yellow-Birds [no. 308], the herbs of the Supreme God Di, and his eight chambers for purification. The Yellow-Birds control the Black-Snakes [no. 307] on Shaman Mountain.164
The Yellow-Birds appear to be functionaries of Di assigned to guard his herbs and plants, which probably confer longevity. Knowing the location of such herbs was part of the esoteric wisdom of the wu-shamans as revealed in the following passage from chapter 16 about the Great Wilds to the West:
There is Shaman Mountain where the ten wu-shamans Xian, Ji, Ban, Peng, Gu, Zhen, Li, Di, Xie, and Luo ascend and descend and there are all kinds of medicinal herbs.165
The commentator Guo Pu considered that their primary purpose in ascending and descending was simply to collect these herbs, though it is possible, as Yuan Ke commented, that this mountain is also a ladder to heaven, enabling communication with the gods. Another group of wu-shamans found in the west whom Guo identified as “divine physicians” are mentioned in chapter 11, “Guideway through Western Lands within the Sea”:
East of the Beast-Facing-East [of Mount Kunlun, no. 269] are the wu-shamans Peng, Di, Yang, Lü, Fan, and Xiang, who bear the corpse of Yayu [nos. 108, 265, 270], each holding the Never-Dying Herb (Busiyao) to revive him. Yayu has a snake’s body and a human face. He was killed by the Minister of Erfu [no. 268].166
The concept of longevity in the Guideways is presented somewhat di erently from that in the cult of Transcendents promoted by the fangshi-wizards.167 Linguistically, it is denoted in the Guideways by the term “never-dying” (busi) or “longevity” (shou) rather than by “eternal life” (changsheng), and the sources of this power are correspondingly vegetable rather than alchemical. In addition to the Never-Dying Herb used to revive Yayu, there is a Never-Dying Tree nearby to the north that probably transfers its powers when its leaves, flowers, or fruit are eaten.168 There is a Mountain of NeverDying located east of the Desert of Shifting Sands in the middle of the Black River and the Never-Dying People [no. 222] who are “black, enjoy longevity, and never die.”169 Another reference elsewhere to a Land of the Never-Dying People notes that they eat from the Sweet-Tree.170 A tribe that dwells in the Land of Xuanyuan [see no. 237] said by commentators to be descendants of the Yellow Thearch is inherently long-lived and said to consider eight hundred years a short life.171 While not all these places are explicity linked with wu-shamans, the shamans are the only ones recorded who make longevity or resurrection available to others. In early Chinese religion, wu-shamans not only o‹ciated at the sacrifices to various gods but apparently maintained a cult of their own consisting of divine shamans.172 The above groups may thus represent pantheons of such figures with Xian as the primary ancestral god. In chapter 7, he has his own state beyond the seas in the west, the Land of Shaman Xian [see no. 235]. It is located at Mount Dengbao, another place where wu-shamans are said to ascend and descend. Yuan Ke believed that the population was a people composed entirely of wu-shamans. They may have been descended from Xian,
52 INTRODUCTION



who is described here as grasping a green snake in his left hand and a red snake in his right hand.173 Xian’s importance in the cult of wu-shamans is confirmed by a passage in the poem “Everlasting Sorrow” in the Songs of Chu anthology. Here the poet, traditionally the Chu aristocrat Qu Yuan, invokes Xian for advice about whether he should journey farther away from the court to protest political slander by his enemies. It is significant as one of the earliest visionary descriptions in Chinese literature of a divine descent:
Shaman Xian was to come down this evening So I entreated him with an o ering of fragrant rice. A hundred gods obscuring everything accompanied his descent As the gods of Nine-Similar-Peaks advanced to welcome him. He manifested his divine presence in a dazzling blaze of glory And announced to me auspicious remarks.174
Yet another figure who is probably a shaman but described simply as a person is Bogao. He appears in chapter 18 as ascending and descending Origination Mountain. The commentator Hao Yixing considered him identical to a Bogao mentioned in the Master Guan, who was historicized as an o‹cial of the Yellow Thearch and ascended to heaven along with him.175 Some figures are particularly associated with snakes and dragons. They may either have snake or dragon bodies themselves, such as the mountain gods along some of the guideways, or they may be described as dominating them by wearing snakes through their ears and by grasping hold of or treading on either of these creatures. For example, in addition to Shaman Xian, the god Rushou [no. 74] wears a snake in his left ear and rides on a pair of dragons. Among some modern scholars, this iconography is considered a clear sign of shamanistic powers. Among others, it is thought to be a vestige of ancient beliefs in which people feared and worshiped snakes and dragons.176 Many of the strange creatures in the Guideways with these attributes can thus be regarded as signifying a historical phase in Chinese religious belief in which this form of shamanism superceded even more ancient snake and dragon cults. Such information in the Guideways o ers but a hint of the rich and diverse culture of the wu-shamans and suggests that it played a role in the early compilation of the text.
Corpses. A unique group that hardly appears in other surviving texts from early China are “corpses.” Some of these may also have been considered wu-shamans. Although ancient beliefs about the afterlife were diverse and did not achieve a broader, systematic formulation until after the arrival of Buddhism in the second century c.e., many local cultures apparently distinguished between dying, death, burial, and disintegration. When someone lay dying, a ritual was performed by wu-shamans and other mediums to summon his wandering soul back to his body, as can be seen in two poems in the
INTRODUCTION 53



Songs of Chu anthology, “The Summons of the Soul” and “The Great Summons.”177 After death was confirmed, the corpse was not necessarily buried immediately but could be preserved for a period above ground. Following burial, it was referred to as an “interred body.” Revival was by then no longer believed possible in most cases, and a slow process of dissolution began which eventually ended with the final extinction of the individual as a spiritual presence. This belief did not prevent a number of techniques being applied, designed to preserve the interred body for as long as possible, such as dressing the body in jade amulets and suits as well as constructing homelike tombs equipped with food and other comforts. Still, it was recognized that in most cases the corpse would eventually disintegrate, and it was said that as a practical matter, ancestors need not be sacrificed to individually after three generations.178 The corpses in the Guideways were not interred, and many appear to have su ered violent deaths.179 They could well be called the “living dead,” since they possess an ongoing presence in the world that ranges from apparently inactive, though preserved bodies, to those simply described as “people,” to shen-gods. In the apparently inactive category is the Corpse of Minister Gu, whose hands are bound behind his back like a thief but who is still armed; the Corpse of Erfu [see nos. 268, 281], who, along with his minister Wei, was probably also punished by Di; as well as the Corpse of Wang Ziye, dismembered and buried in di erent places.180 Most of these are located in the north, the direction traditionally associated with death. The Corpse of Zuzhuang is described as “a person with squared-o teeth and a tiger’s tail” and the Corpse of Jubi as “a person with a broken neck, disheveled hair, and one arm missing.”181 Among the more active figures is a strange creature identified by Guo Pu as a god of the Quanrong tribe (the Dog People [nos. 278, 334]) known as the Corpse of King Xuan of the Rong, who is a red animal with the form of a horse without a head.182 Another god, the Corpse of Shebi [nos. 254, 302], has an animal’s body, a human face, and dog’s ears with two green snakes through them, while a similar creature, the Corpse of Liling [no. 299], has an animal’s body with a human face.183 The last two figures may be divine shamans. All these corpses, though technically dead, have not disintegrated, and it must be assumed that even the most inanimate continue to possess a magical, demonic power to endure that makes them a notable feature of the landscape. Another corpse recorded in chapter 7 is more clearly related to wu-shamans:
The Corpse of Woman Chou [no. 317] when alive was burned to death by the ten suns north of the Land of Men [see no. 234]. She shields her face with her right hand. When the ten suns are at their height, Woman Chou is on the summit of the mountain.
Chapter 16 states, “There is a person dressed in green who hides her face with her sleeve called the Corpse of Woman Chou.”184 These passages combine the Shang myth of the ten suns mentioned elsewhere in the Guideways with the ancient custom of ritually exposing and even burning female shamans to obtain rain.185 Here the Corpse of Woman Chou exists in the eternal present of mythology and repeats the ritual action of being burned by the ten suns every time there is a drought. According to one interpretation, she is impersonating Drought-Fury [no. 332], who is also described in chapter 17 as dressed in green. A daughter of the Yellow Thearch, Drought-Fury was sent by
54 INTRODUCTION



him to curb the winds and rain unleashed by the challenger Chiyou in their epic power struggle. She was unable to return to heaven, however, and was forced to remain on earth, where she causes droughts. Though the Yellow Thearch ordered his daughter to stay north of the Red River and appointed Shujun as Ancestral God of the Fields to police her, she wanders about and must be exorcised. This passage in the “Guideway through the Great Wilds in the North” is particularly noteworthy, because it concludes with a ritual curse to Drought-Fury, which is supposed to cause her to return back north.186
Foreign Tribes. Almost no foreign tribes are listed in the Guideways through Mountains, since it focuses on the strange inhabitants of the known Chinese world. However, the remaining chapters of the Guideways through Seas identifies some ninety-five foreign lands and tribes, two-thirds of whom are described in varying degrees of detail. These tribes inhabit the zones “within the seas” and “beyond the seas” as well as the Great Wilds. Their precise geographical distance from an implied Chinese world at the center is not measured, though their sequential location along each guideway indicates that some dwelled in closer proximity than others. Their precise location is sometimes further complicated by textual errors and the inclusion of multiple versions so that the same tribe may be found in di erent directions and given varying descriptions. Like the geographical places in the Guideways, the ethnographic data includes peoples confirmed in historical texts as well as highly fantastic groups located in mythological realms without distinguishing between them. The Guideways presents a discernable rhetoric of the ethnological “other” by using several criteria to distinguish between those tribes that are similar to Chinese in some respect and those that are completely di erent. These are primarily kinship relations, which may be further denoted by Chinese surnames; cultural habits such as clothing or diet; physical appearance; and methods of procreation. Some tribes are said to be descended from the most commonly mentioned thearchs such as Zhuanxu, Thearch Jun, and especially the Yellow Thearch. Or they may be the descendants of those who were defeated, killed, or exiled by a thearch who then extended mercy to the survivors. Among the examples with some basis in historical fact may be the Ba People, who are noted as descended from the thearch Greater-Brilliance and who are probably the ancient inhabitants of the part of modern eastern Sichuan once known as the Land of Ba. Regardless of their degree of similarity to Chinese people, though, most possess some bizarre feature that still renders them fundamentally strange. The Pendant-Ears People [no. 328] are descended from the Yellow Thearch and share a Chinese cultural feature as well, for they are said to also eat grains. But physically, these people have ears that are so long that they must support them with their hands when they walk. The Dog People [nos. 278, 334] were also originally descended from the Yellow Thearch but because they were more directly the o spring of a white, two-headed, hermaphroditic dog, they physically resemble dogs. At the other end of the spectrum are tribes with completely fantastic appearances. The One-Eyed People [nos. 242, 333], the One-Arm People [no. 230], those without calves or intestines, and the Fire-Gluttons [no. 218], who have animal bodies and black hair and emit fire when they open their mouths, are but a few. In most cases, it is di‹cult to identify the processes by which the more fantastic tribes were conceptualized and recorded. One possibility is that their names may have orig

inally been totemic and that their strange features were first represented highly pictorially, either in images or graphs.187 In the context of the widespread belief in hybrids, these names and signs may have been interpreted literally by later readers distanced from them in time and space, rather as if contemporary Americans regarded the Crow Indians as a people who had the heads and feet of crows. It is also possible that genuine anomalies such as the births of babies with congenital defects generated and periodically confirmed a rich folklore of hybrid peoples.188 Throughout traditional China

through the modern period, foreigners both near and far continued to be characterized as demons or animals, even to the point of conventionally including such graphic determinants as quan (dog) in their names in a manner similar to the description of the Rong tribes [nos. 278, 288, 334]. Historically, some of these people were recorded as living next to and even within the borders of northwestern Chinese states such as Qin and Jin and even interacted with the ruling class politically at court. Such groups were usually distinguished from their more distant kin who were specifically called the Quanrong or Dog-Rong in the Guideways. The ethnographic information in the Guideways was one of the aspects of the text that later readers regarded most seriously. In a few cases, representatives of peoples in the Guideways were also mentioned in other early texts as having traveled to Chinese courts in antiquity. During the Western Han, some thirty-six lands mentioned in the text appeared again in the Master of Huainan, and later, when Liu Xin submitted his version of the Guideways to the imperial court, he championed it by claiming that “one can use it to observe the customs of foreign lands and strange peoples.”189 Some modern scholars have argued that this strata of information links the Guideways with the later genre of “Illustrations of Tributary Peoples” (fig. 14).190 These scrolls combining images with descriptive texts were compiled by Chinese rulers who employed painters and scholar-o‹cials to record ethnographic information about foreign emissaries when they visited their courts. They may, in fact, represent a development of some of the original illustrations of the Guideways, which most commentators have felt were an integral part of the text in its earliest forms.
THE ILLUSTRATIONS
Liu Xin did not specifically mention any illustrations in the preface to his edition. However, some later scholars have seen in his remark above as well as in certain passages that appear to be captions indications that the text contained or referred to parallel visual information at that time. Further hypotheses about the generic nature of early cosmographies and geographical works support the view that from its inception the text of the Guideways may well have been accompanied by images or maps, even though no evidence of these has surfaced so far. According to some, the text, or parts of it, were originally a commentary to pre-existing images, while others have maintained that the images were drawn to illustrate the text.191 At the end of the third century c.e., it was suggested that the Guideways was originally a commentary to the figures of strange creatures on Yu’s Nine Bronze Vessels, a theory sometimes advanced by later scholars who accepted the authorship of Yu the Great and his o‹cials.192 Since almost none of the illustrated texts of the Warring States period have survived, it is di‹cult to know the precise style of these images or the format of the book. Furthermore, the lack of any explicit mention of illustrations prior to Guo Pu’s Encomiums has led one recent scholar to assert that all prior versions of the Guideways were only written texts and contained no visual material at all.193 One di‹culty in imagining the nature of the early illustrations, if they indeed existed, is due to the ambiguity of the Chinese graph tu. In early Chinese texts, tu denoted a range of meanings referring to pictures, maps, plans, diagrams, and tables. Often the
INTRODUCTION 57



literary context is insu‹cient to determine exactly which was meant.194 The figures supposedly engraved on Yu’s Nine Bronze Vessels were called tu and were presumably regarded as individual portraits. On the other hand, Hao Yixing believed that the original tu of the Guideways were basically topographical maps that included images of strange creatures at the appropriate places.195 Just as the understanding and use of the text underwent changes through the centuries, so the sets of accompanying illustrations must certainly have reflected di erent period and local styles.196 One can therefore only suggest from scattered pieces of surviving evidence the kind of images of strange creatures that existed during a given period and that would most likely resemble to some degree those that might have been included in earlier versions of the Guideways. Designs on pottery, bronze vessels, and decorative objects unearthed from Neolithic, Shang, and Zhou tombs constitute the most abundant evidence today of the pervasiveness of images of strange creatures in early China. However, before the Warring States period, these used relatively few generic types whose precise identification sometimes depends on later scholarly convention. Their meanings continue to be debated, and the styles dictated by the materials and formats probably di er from those of painted illustrations.197 Some examples of Warring States bronze sculpture o er more complex images of hybrids, and these often employ naturalistic forms. In the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (d. c. 433 b.c.e.), excavated in 1978 in modern Suizhou, Hubei, are a pair of fully sculpted hybrids serving as base supports for a set of chimes. These combine a dragon’s head with a long tongue, snakelike ears, a crane’s neck, a bird’s body and wings, and a turtle’s feet. Another genre of hybrids are tomb-guardian figurines designed to protect the deceased from damage by snakes and other malevolent forces. One type that has been recovered from the same Warring States period tomb in Chu that yielded the zither decorated with wu-shamans possesses antlers, a beast’s head with a long tongue, claws, and a scaly body with a tail and is shown eating a snake. Similar figures continued to be produced through the early Han and, according to one theory, may represent Earth Lord (Tubo), a god of the underworld.198 But perhaps the most closely related images would have been depicted in murals. Unfortunately, none of these have survived, having been destroyed by war, natural decay, and changing tastes. Later literary evidence suggests that depicting strange creatures on walls was a popular motif for religious, ideological, and decorative purposes and that texts may have helped to explain them.199 Fortunately, a decorated co‹n from the Warring States period and a silk scroll from the Western Han suggest what early illustrations looked like. The panels of the inner co‹n of Marquis Yi of Zeng contain over nine hundred figures executed in gold and black lacquer against a red background (figs. 15a, 15b).200 Practically all these are hybrids. Many have mutiple features, which make them di‹cult to classify, but more than 80 percent can be considered to belong to dragon-snake hybrids. Like the tomb figurine of Earth Lord mentioned above, they may be figures with the power to protect the body by controlling snakes or other intruders. In addition, birds, bird-headed animals, a few deer, Feng-Birds, fish, and rats are depicted. Although the iconography of some of the groupings may encode known myths of the time, there is still no agreement about their meanings. However, a number of features can be compared to descriptions of strange creatures in the Guideways, for example, humanlike figures grasping

snakes and those wearing snakes through their ears, winged dragons, winged snakes, multiheaded creatures, and four-footed snakes. Most striking are twenty divine guardians holding halberds along both lengths of the co‹n. They guard painted windows believed to be openings permitting the soul to exit from and return to the co‹n. Some have human faces with horns, scaly bodies, wings, and tails. Others have animal heads with human faces and appear to be standing on clouds, while a third group have animal faces with horns and whiskers and human bodies. These, too, have been variously interpreted.201 In contrast to the more naturalistic tendencies in Warring States sculpture, their frontal, iconic delineation is more appropriate to two-dimensional surface decoration. They bear a close stylistic resemblance to the set of divine figures in the Chu Silk

Manuscript (Chuzengbo, c. 3rd cent. b.c.e., figs. 16a, 16b), suggesting one fairly consistent style of illustration of strange creatures that could be broadly termed “logographic” in that they reflect a flat, linear sensibility similar to ancient Chinese graphs, especially pictographs. The Chu Silk Manuscript was obtained in 1942 from a tomb near modern Changsha, Hunan. It contains an occult text arranged in two rectangles that enjoins the reader to sacrifice to the appropriate gods and act in accordance with the proper calendrical periods. This text is surrounded by images of twelve figures depicted with fine black lines and colored in red, brown, and blue as well as four divine trees that support the sky, one in each corner. These figures have now been generally accepted by most scholars as gods personifying the twelve months of the lunar calendar. Similar to Chinese almanacs, the colophons indicate their names and which activities are favorable or not during the period over which each god holds sway. Another more suggestive theory notes the similarity between the names of some of these figures and a group of wushamans mentioned in the Guideways. While none of the images exactly corresponds in all details, several utilize motifs that also appear among the strange creatures. In image 7 (fig. 16b),202 for example, the three heads with human faces are also a characteristic of the gods of Bitter Mountain, Lesser Chamber, and Greater Chamber Mountains [no. 191].203 Image 2 has a forked tongue, as do the People with Forked Tongues [no. 223],204 while image 8 appears to be grasping two snakes, as do a number of figures in the Guideways. Image 6 is a snake with a single head and two bodies like the Feiyi [no. 113].205 Image 10 may be a dragon’s head on a bird’s body like the gods along the

first guideway through the Western Mountains [no. 16].206 Other common features include hybrid bodies, vertical eyes, claws, horns, disheveled hair, reversed forearms, a four-legged snake, and a bird with a single leg.207 It is unlikely that the original format of the Guideways would have resembled the single sheet of the Chu Silk Manuscript. Rather, the text was probably written in the common book format of bamboo slats tied together to form rolls, and the illustrations could have been depicted on accompanying scrolls of silk. It is also possible that in the finest versions intended for rulers both text and images were transcribed together on scrolls of silk.208 A rare example of this latter format was excavated in 1974 from a Western Han dynasty tomb dated 168 b.c.e. at Mawangdui in modern Changsha (fig. 17), known as the Divination Scroll of Astronomical and Weather Forms (Boshu yunqi zhantu). Like the Chu Silk Manuscript, it is composed of images together with captions where unusual cloud formations both abstract and more figural appear above several lines of text, each relating to the images’ divinatory significance. This work has been considered a product of the School of Techniques and Calculations and is believed to quite possibly predate the Han. If so, its represents an easily expandable format that could have accommodated a text as long as the Guideways.209 The continuing popularity of images of strange creatures during the Western Han

was noted in the Master of Huainan, which repeated an earlier anecdote from the Master Hanfei (c. before 233 b.c.e.) that many contemporary painters lazily yielded to the temptation of depicting strange creatures that few had seen instead of undertaking the more di‹cult task of painting readily observed animals.210 One such example can be seen in an ink sketch of a flying tiger preserved on a fragment of wood found in northwestern China along the Silk Road (fig. 18). This is believed to date from the Xin dynasty, just a few years after Liu Xin presented his version of the Guideways to the court. Its simple delineation of form is perhaps the closest indication from this time of what similar illustrations on bamboo, wood, or silk might have looked like. During the Han, the continuing importance of the Guideways and other such texts as omen catalogues is evident in some of the stone engravings at the Wu Liang Shrine (c. 151 c.e.) in modern Jiaxiang, Shandong. Among its abundant compositions are more than twenty now damaged illustrations of strange creatures placed next to columns of text indicating whether their appearance signifies good or evil as well as their e ect on the moral purity of the ruler (fig. 19). A few are strange creatures who have been identified with those mentioned in the Guideways, such as the Bifang-Bird [see no. 69], the Shared-Eyes Fish [see no. 230], and the Zhujian beast [no. 102].211 These juxtapositions of text and images are believed to derive directly from a catalogue format that by this time could also have been written on paper.212 None of the omen catalogues of the Han survive, but two Tang dynasty scrolls preserved among the Dunhuang manuscripts suggest what they probably looked like. One is an untitled silk scroll belonging to the genre known as “Illustrations of Auspicious Anomalies” (Ruiyingtu, fig. 20). Damaged in parts, this scroll probably dates from the eighth or ninth century. It preserves

twenty-two separate images, each one placed above a column of text explaining it. Some of the texts cite earlier sources, including the Guideways.213 Another scroll on paper from about the same period, titled The Beast of the White Marsh’s Illustrations of Strange Creatures (Baize jingguaitu, fig. 21), has also survived, though it is now separated into two fragments. It too contains various strange creatures, two to a column, interspersed with explanations.214 It is clear from Guo Pu’s commentary, his Encomiums, and Tao Qian’s poems that the text circulated with illustrations during the Eastern Jin dynasty.215 However, it is not known if there was a single tradition of illustrations with which all early readers were familiar or if they varied greatly with each version and further changed over time. Nor is it clear whether Guo Pu’s illustrations were directly related to those that might have circulated during the Warring States and Qin-Han periods. At some point, as the religious traditions surrounding these creatures declined, the illustrations undoubtedly became artistic interpretations primarily based on imaginative readings of the text rather than depictions of an existing pantheon reflecting a continuous tradition of iconography. The first illustrations that have been attributed to an individual was a set of 247 by the artist Zhang Sengyou (c. 470–550).216 Zhang was noted for depicting both Chinese and foreign figures with a heightened sense of physical presence through shading tech

niques and precise detail. Unfortunately, none of his works has survived. These illustrations were said to have been preserved up to the Northern Song dynasty when, in 999, 242 were redrawn by Shu Ya (c. 935–1005), who discovered a damaged set in the Imperial Library. How close Shu Ya’s were to the originals remains a question, for his set has also disappeared.217 Moreover, it is known that paintings were mistakenly attributed to Zhang Sengyou in the Song, so it is quite possible that whatever Shu Ya copied may not have been a genuine work by Zhang. For example, a hand scroll titled The True Appearances of the Five Planets and Twenty-eight Constellations (Wuxing ershibaxiu zhenxingtu, fig. 22) was mistakenly attributed by some connoisseurs to Zhang Seng

Two of these astronomical divinities are represented as hybrid deities clothed as Chinese o‹cials striking standard, dignified poses. The paint

ing indicates the development of a more humanized portraiture of hybrids that expresses the Chinese impulse to domesticate the threat of the strange by representing divinities as celestial bureaucrats.219 Such treatments can also be found in earlier centuries, for example, in popular figurines of the twelve calendrical animals as well as in a variety of Daoist and Buddhist religious images.220 During the Tang and Song dynasties, the text of the Guideways also circulated independently from the illustrations, sets of illustrations circulated separately from the text, and still other sets of illustrations contained only excerpts from the text as captions.221 One may gain an idea of the high quality of some Song illustrations from an early-nineteenth-century Qing dynasty woodblock version of the ancient glossary, Approaching Refinement. This woodblock was based on a hand-copied text from the Yuan, which was said to have been an exact copy of a Song manuscript.222 Approaching Refinement was another ancient work championed by Guo Pu, who produced a commentary to an illustrated edition emphasizing historical phonology. A number of strange creatures are included in its lists of objects, and Guo sometimes refers to these in his commentary on the Guideways. The Qing dynasty version was reengraved by an artisan, Peng Wancheng (n.d.) of Dangtu in modern Anhui. Assuming that Peng was relatively faithful to the originals, the compact solidity of the compositions, elegance of the lines, and graphic clarity of the images suggests a Song sensibility when compared to later Ming and Qing interpretations. A representative page presents five strange creatures, each situated in its own landscape and distributed according to the five directions (fig. 23): the Shared-Eyes Fish [see no. 230] in the east; the Shared-Shoulder Beasts [see no. 230] in the west; the Two-Headed Snake in the center; the Shared-Shoulder People [see no. 230] in the north; and the Shared-Wings Birds [see nos. 54, 215, 230] in the south.223

Beginning in the fourteenth century and accelerating during the latter half of the Ming dynasty, the expansion of literacy and the prosperity of the urban areas provided the commercial basis for the rapid growth of printed books ranging from expensive editions to cheap reprints. The reading public broadened beyond the scholar-gentry to include a greater number of educated merchants, scholars with merchant backgrounds, middlebrow readers as well as women and other hitherto more marginally literate groups. Illustrations for classical works as well as for the latest popular literature proliferated, designed by professional artisans of varying degrees of skill who initially were mostly anonymous. However, by the late Ming, many of these artisans began to sign their work and were joined by some notable scholar-artists who occasionally turned to such commercial endeavors for profit. An example of the latter is Xiao Yuncong’s (1596–1673) Illustrations to the “Questions of Heaven” (Tianwentu, fig. 24), which includes a plate illustrating the Ba-Snake [no. 267] swallowing an elephant, one of the subjects also treated in the Guideways. Interpretations of popular gods circulated not only through encyclopedias, illustrations of fiction, folk prints, and the decorative arts, but also through special compendia such as The Complete Collection of Gods of the Three

Teachings mentioned earlier that anthologized the gods of popular Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism with accompanying descriptions. This veritable explosion of images facilitated shifts in visuality that both reflected and further encouraged new ways of reading and looking at things.224 That illustrators and engravers began to sign their names to their work indicates a highly competitive market in which publishers sought every means to gain an advantage. This fact did not, however, prevent widespread pirating. Some of these images were quickly disseminated through reprints, reengravings, and other forms of appropriation so that their precise genealogy is often di‹cult to establish. It is from this period, which entered a heightened phase of activity beginning with the Wanli era (1573–1620), that the earliest surviving illustrations to the Guideways date.225 The most widely reproduced form of illustrations has been individual portraits of strange creatures by anonymous artisans. They were the most cost e‹cient, requiring the least amount of labor and technical ability to engrave. The earliest surviving ones slightly predate the scenic tradition of Jiang Yinghao’s designs that are reproduced here. They may well represent an older practice, for a preface to the earliest examples of these is dated 1593. This work, Illustrations to the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing tu), was edited by the anthologist and dramatist Hu Wenhuan (fl. c. 1593–1596) of Hangzhou in modern Zhejiang and presents sixty-seven plates with brief texts, which Hu claimed were assembled and expanded by him from anonymous sources.226 A few images are not actually from the text of the Guideways and appear to have been added by Hu on his own. Others, such as the illustration of the Heluo-Fish (fig. 25a, no. 92) reappear in later Qing editions of the Guideways (fig. 25b). An even earlier work that may be related is the Illustrations and Records of Foreign Regions (Yiyu tuzhi, c. 14th cent.), a Ming example of the tradition of o‹cially sponsored portraits of tributary peoples. The original version of this book has been dated to the early Ming dynasty, though it only survives in a single edition that is probably a reengraving from the late Ming.227 Nevertheless, it clearly refers to tributary peoples who visited the Ming capital of Nanjing and also includes other foreign tribes with captions taken from earlier texts. One hundred sixty-eight foreign peoples and strange creatures are represented along with captions, including some from the Guideways such as the Feathered People (fig. 26a, no. 216). What is most interesting in these illustrations is that the style of these portraits is almost identical to those selected for a late Ming encyclopedia, the Collected Illustrations of Heaven, Earth, and Man (Sancai tuhui, c. 1609, fig. 26b). This multivolume work reproduced numerous images from various unnamed sources. The more crudely engraved All-Purpose, Correct-Way Encyclopedia That Requires No Further Inquiry (Wanyong zhengzong buqiuren quanbian, c. 1607) is also thought to have borrowed some of its 130 or so images for the chapter on various foreign lands from the Illustrations and Records, as did yet another encyclopedia of this time, the Complete Handbook of a Myriad Treasures (Wanbao quanshu, late Ming).228 Thus, there was an “iconic circuit” of woodblock portraits of strange creatures in the Ming period whose designer(s) and ultimate origin(s) remain unknown. Images from this portrait tradition continued to be disseminated during the Qing dynasty and were reengraved along with others for Wu Renchen’s 1667 edition of the Guideways, which printed a total of 144 (fig. 26c). These were grouped together sepa

rately from the text and organized into the categories of “divinities,” “foreign regions,” “beasts,” “birds,” and “fish and reptiles.” In one of his prefaces, he claimed that they transmit the style of Shu Ya, though scholars have usually dismissed this.229 A finer version of Wu Renchen’s 1667 edition was recut in 1786 by the Shuyetang of Jinchang (modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) under the title An Expanded and Illustrated Edition of the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Extensive Commentaries (Zengbu huixiang shanhaijing guangzhu, fig. 26d). This has been widely reproduced in succeeding editions through the present and is probably the one best known today.230 Another example of portraits worth mentioning indicates the parallel practice of hand-painted illustrations that continued alongside printed versions. One set from the Qing period is now in the National Central Library in Taipei. Another set of some 420 images was painted by a poor, unknown scholar, Wang Fu (1692–1759) of Wuyuan, Jiangxi, who at one point had designed decorations for porcelains in the factories at Jingdezhen (modern Jingdezhen, Jiangxi). The originals were preserved locally for five

generations, though some were destroyed by war. Finally, the remaining ones were copied lithographically by Yu Jiading (n.d.) and Zha Meike (n.d.), who added others in a similar style for those missing from chapters 6 to 13. A book was finally published along with Wang’s own commentary as A Preserved Edition of the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing cun) in 1895 (fig. 27). While these images generally follow the forms of the portrait tradition, they are quite painterly in their use of texturing brushstrokes. The animated eyes, facial details, and active poses endow the strange creatures with an unsual degree of playfulness and intimacy. By comparison, the outline style and the sti er poses of the woodblock illustrations distance the strange creatures, rendering them even stranger to viewers whose attitude becomes correspondingly more clinical and voyeuristic. The more elaborate set of illustrations reproduced here was interspersed with the text of a 1597 reprint of the Wang Chongqing edition, which was originally published without them in 1537. The images may well have been added to enhance the book’s marketability sixty years later, for they represented an increased investment by the publisher and utilized a more prestigious visual style associated with scholar culture. They would have had a competitive edge over other editions, which merely reproduced the more utilitarian portrait series or contained no illustrations at all. These images are credited to an otherwise unknown artisan, Jiang Yinghao (n.d.), courtesy name Wulin, who was from Guangling (modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Jiang’s designs are the earliest surviving examples of what might be termed the “scenic tradition,” in which several strange creatures are set in a carefully delineated, panoramic landscape. The origin of some of the individual figures may also derive from the iconic circuit of late Ming portraits. For example, Jiang’s figure of the god Yuer [no. 1] is identical to an image in Hu Wenhuan’s Illustrations to the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (fig. 28). However, the artist also appropriated the elements of literati landscape painting to create compositions of trees, plants, rocks, and water in the mode of the Song dynasty version of Approaching Refinement. These forms had been codified in printed painting manuals popular during the late Ming that presented woodblock versions of model landscapes derived from the manners of the great masters of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Jiang followed a practice typical among illustrators of selecting elements from this standardized reper

toire of visual schemata to form individual backgrounds for each of the seventy-six plates. These provide elegant settings for the three hundred fifty or so figures that are represented out of the more than five hundred mentioned in the text. The precise criteria for depicting these particular strange creatures does not seem to be clear, yet it does seem that the more common animals and familiar mythological figures were passed over in favor of the obscure, the unusual, and the bizarre.231 The designer employed a certain degree of artistic liberty, for the majority of the plates group several creatures together in a single scene, even though the text states that they dwelled at considerable distances from one another. These panoramic views can be considered a visual realization of the cosmography as a collection and display of anomalies for privileged viewers. In Chinese tradition, only sages or unlucky travelers were said to perceive these spiritually potent or ominous creatures. But by framing them in bucolic scenes employing inviting perspectives, the artist invites us to safely scan a world in which these normally hidden powers stand exposed for our scrutiny in various innocuous attitudes. Rarely do they appear dangerous or threatening, as the text sometimes informs us they can be. On the contrary,

their relaxed poses of domesticated contentment elicit curiosity and pleasure as the reader gazes at the exotic from a comfortable distance. Especially with regard to the foreign peoples, the illustrations to the Guideways indulge in what might be called an oriental version of “Orientalism” by revealing the same kind of imperialistic attitudes that have characterized many Western depictions of the East. Interestingly, around this time, European illustrators were also depicting natural curiosities in the New World set against composite model landscapes derived from European artistic traditions. Jiang’s designs continued to be reproduced during the first half of the seventeenth century. Seventy-four of the plates were included in another finely engraved edition of the Guideways with Guo Pu’s commentary published during the Chongzhen era (1628–1644). The text was engraved by Li Wenxiao (n.d.), courtesy name Xiyu, from Jinling (modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), who is known to have been active during this period. The illustrations were engraved by two other artisans, Liu Suming (n.d.), originally named Guohao, and Wang Xingchun (n.d.). Liu was a member of one of the leading book-publishing families of Jianyang, Fujian, and active as an engraver during the Tianqi (1621–1627) and Chongzhen eras.

survived, mostly illustrated novels and plays, indicating that he worked for various publishers in Nanjing and elsewhere.232 An accomplished illustrator in his own right, he was said to have combined the primitive, folklike style of the Jianyang publishers with the mannerisms of the Anhui school of scholar-painters. However, for this edition, both he and Wang reengraved the original Jiang Yinghao designs with only minor alterations including dropping the first and last plates. Their accurate but not necessarily superior version nevertheless proved popular and eventually made its way to Japan, where another faithful reengraving was later produced in 1902 by the Bunkòdò of Nagoya. Both the scenic and portrait traditions were appropriately reunited in the grand encyclopedia The Imperially Sponsored Collection of Past and Present Illustrations and Texts (Qinding gujin tushu jicheng, 1725, see fig. 29), whose illustrations of strange creatures can be considered a continuation of the Song style. This immense compendium sponsored by the Qing court contains several chapters titled “Various Gods of the Mountains and Rivers” (Shanchuan zhushen). The primary focus of one of them is on the Guideways, with fifty-three illustrations of selected strange creatures. With the exceptions of one image acknowledged to have been taken from the Collected Images of Heaven, Earth, and Man and three that contain more than one figure, all the others combine a portrait of an individual creature with a landscape background. Most of the images of the creatures appear to generally follow the Jiang Yinghao or Wu Renchen

iconography, but all have been redrawn with greater naturalism and attention to detail such as the figure of Xingtian [no. 233] (fig. 29).233 Finally, two more recent series of illustrations, one from the nineteenth century and another from the early twentieth, can be compared to Jiang’s and provide some indication of the general decline of the traditional art of Chinese book illustration during this period. A late Qing dynasty set was published by the Haiqinglou in 1855 and signed by an artisan, Cheng Huoyin (n.d.) of Guocheng in modern Sichuan (fig. 30). The crowded spacing and crudely articulated lines are more characteristic of inexpensive, mass-produced folk prints that often represented local gods, New Year’s themes, and other auspicious symbols. Although these bold images possess a certain aesthetic appeal for the modern eye, which appreciates primitivism and ethnic authenticity, they rank far below the standards of elite Chinese taste to which the Jiang Yinghao designs aspired. A final series of lithographic images from a version of the Guideways printed during the prewar Republican period indicates the further erosion of artistic ambition

These portraits, from the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Illustrations and Explanations (Shanhaijing tushuo, n.d.) were redrawn from earlier editions including one dated 1918.234 The simply executed figures are bunched together in a small format printed on inexpensive paper; many seem crowded by the texts and encomiums inscribed as colophons. While this work testifies to the continuing interest in the Guideways among a wide public, it also makes one appreciate even more the beauty of Jiang Yinghao’s designs. Though all the surviving images reflect the imaginations of artists working in the styles of later Chinese book illustration, they still manage to convey a palpable sense of these strange creatures rooted in antiquity.

PLATE I
1. Y U E R \‡ The god Yuer does not actually appear in any extant edition of the Guideways. However, this image is identical to one found in the beginning of another work of the late sixteenth century, Illustrations to the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing tu, 1593) edited by Hu Wenhuan (fl. c. 1593–1596, see fig. 28). Hu acknowledged including several additional figures and in a colophon indicated the original source for Yuer in the “Minor Inquiries” chapter of the compendium Master Guan (Guanzi: Xiaowen, c. 5th–1st cent. b.c.e.). It states:
Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643 b.c.e.) was on a military campaign northwards against the state of Guzhu. A little more than three miles from the Beier River, he stopped short and stared transfixed. He aimed his bow but drew back and dared not shoot, saying to his attendants, “Do you see that person ahead?” The attendants answered, “We see no one.” The Duke said, “This campaign is destined to fail for I am much confused! I have just seen a person only a foot tall with completely human features. He wore a hat and his right arm was raised as he raced o on a horse. This campaign is destined to fail for I am much confused! How could there be a person like this?” Guan Zhong (c. 730–645 b.c.e.) replied, “I have heard that there is a god of climbing mountains, Yuer, who is only one foot tall with completely human features. When a hegemon arises, the god of climbing mountains appears. He races o on a horse to indicate the way. When he raises his arm, it means that there is a river ahead. The right arm means to turn right to cross the river.” When they arrived at the Beier River, there was someone there to aid them in crossing who said, “If you cross to the left, the water’s depth will reach your hats but if you cross to the right, it is only as deep as your thighs. You can cross successfully to the right.” Duke Huan stood and bowed before Guan Zhong on his horse and said, “I am at fault for not realizing your sageliness.” Guan Zhong replied, “I have heard that a sage can know things before they appear but just now, I was only able to know this after he appeared. Your humble servant is no sage, merely someone who is able to understand the teachings of others.”
Hu Wenhuan noted that Yuer wears a yellow hat and a vermilion gown. During the early Western Han dynasty, a cavalry troop named the Yuer Cavalry rode in the vanguard. It is, perhaps, appropriate that he is represented in the first of the illustrations to the Guideways as a spirit who will guide the reader through the mountains to follow.1

Many cinnamon trees and an abundance of metal and jade are found here. There is also a plant like a scallion with green flowers named Celebrating-Abundance, which relieves hunger if eaten, and a luminous tree like the mulberry with black veins known as the Confusion-Mulberry. Wearing a piece of this tree from the belt will cure mental confusion. There is an animal here whose form resembles a Yu-Ape with white ears. It walks crouched

over but runs like a man. It is called the Xingxing. Eating it enhances one’s ability to run. The Beautiful-Deer River flows forth from here westward into the sea. In it are found many Yupei, which will cure intestinal parasites if worn from the belt.2 The commentator Guo Pu (276–324) noted that the Yu-Ape is bigger than a macaque and, in addition to white ears, possesses red eyes and a long tail. The Xingxing is also mentioned in chapter 10 [no. 263] as resembling a pig with a human face as well as in chapter 18, where it is said to be capable of identifying people by name.3 Its ability to speak may be why The Compendium of Mr. Lü (Lüshi chunqiu, c. 239 b.c.e.) considered its lips a delicacy.4 The History of the Latter [Eastern] Han Dynasty (Houhanshu, mid-5th cent.) located it among the barbarian tribes of the Southwest, and the commentary by Li Xian (651–684) provided more details about the Xingxing’s behavior from a now-lost work, Records of the South (Nanzhongji, n.d.):
The Xingxing lives in the valleys here [i.e., in Ailao District, near modern Baoshan, Yunnan]. It travels about without any fixed pattern and dwells along with the many other creatures. People capture it by placing wine along its path. It is also fond of

sandals, and the locals weave several tens of pairs of straw sandals, which they attach to each other. The Xingxing in a valley, upon seeing the wine and sandals, knows it is a trap and also knows the name of the trapper. It calls it out and scolds him, saying, “You slave! You are trying to trap me!” and leaves. But then it returns, calling out as it samples the wine. At first, it drinks only a little and puts on a pair of sandals. But if it drinks a few pints, it becomes drunk and can be caught. Since the sandals are all joined together, it cannot leave and so it is grabbed and put in a cage. When someone wishes to fetch it, he goes to the cage and says, “Xingxing! You can come out by yourself,” whereupon the Xingxing turns to him and cries.5
3. W H I T E - G I B B O N S ( B A I Y U A N ) ’· Three hundred li farther east is Hall-Court Mountain, where there are many Yan-Trees, many White-Gibbons, and much rock crystal and yellow gold.6 According to Guo Pu, gibbons are also like macaques but with larger arms and longer feet, which enable them to move about speedily. They normally have black and yellow coloring and utter a plaintive cry. This last feature was often employed by later poets as a conventional image of human sorrow. The dictionary Explanations and Analyses of Graphs (Shuowen jiezi, 100 c.e.) noted the gibbon’s ability to throw things.7 In one of his encomiums to the illustrations to the Guideways of his time, Guo Pu celebrated the White-Gibbon’s command of archery by comparing it to Yang Youji (fl. c. 575 b.c.e.), a nobleman and legendary archer of Chu:
The White-Gibbon’s skill is without doubt. Like Yang Youji it can draw a bow. Casting but a glance, it lets out a shout Instinctively hitting the mark just so. Time after time, it never gives out. Its marvelous talent presents an endless show.8
This skill at archery is not mentioned in the extant text of the Guideways. Perhaps an early artist thought of it because of the White-Gibbon’s long arms. The present illustration is more faithful to the text and simply depicts these gibbons as monkeys. Guo Pu also noted that the fruit of the Yan-Tree is red, resembles apples, and is edible.9
4. S T R A N G E B E A S T ( G U A I S H O U ) «~ Three hundred eighty li farther east is Gibbon-Wings Mountain, where there are many strange beasts, strange fish, an abundance of white jade, and many Fu-Vipers [no. 5], strange snakes, and strange trees. This mountain should not be climbed.10 Neither the text of the Guideways nor later commentators provided any description of these strange beasts, so the illustration is probably the result of the artist’s imagination. The beasts are complemented by the many strange fish found in the surrounding rivers. Here Guo Pu o ered his definition of the strange as “anything with a unique or abnormal appearance.” The commentator Hao Yixing (1757–1829) noted that white jade was used in antiquity to decorate the royal crown.11

nose, reaching a weight of more than one hundred jin (133 lbs.). It is also known as the Snout-Viper.12
6. S T R A N G E S N A K E ( G U A I S H E ) «D Another denizen of GibbonWings Mountain though not otherwise described in the text, the strange snakes like the strange beasts and Fu-Vipers here, are undoubtedly best avoided by humans.13
PLATE III
7. L U S H U ¿æ Three hundred seventy li farther east stands South of the Niu-Trees Mountain, where there is much red-metal on its southern slope and white-metal on its northern slope. There is a beast here whose form resembles a horse with a white head, stripes like a tiger, and a red tail. It makes a sound like a man singing and is called the Lushu. Wearing it from the belt will help people sire many descendants.14 The red tail may signify the Lushu’s exceptional potency. Guo Pu in his Encomiums to the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing tuzan, c. 320) specified that one should use its skin and hair for a talisman.15
8. T W I S T I N G - T U R T L E ( X U A N G U I ) ¤t The Strange River flows east from South of the Niu-Trees Mountain into the Xianyi River. In it are found many black turtles that have the form of a turtle but with a bird’s head and a viper’s tail. They are called Twisting-Turtles and make a sound like wood splitting. Wearing a piece of one from the belt as a talisman will prevent deafness, and it can also remove calluses.16
9. L I U - F I S H ( L I U ) ‘ Three hundred li farther east is Root Mountain, where there are many rivers yet no plants or trees. There is a fish here whose form resembles an ox. It dwells in the hills and possesses a snake’s tail, wings, and feathers on its ribs. It is said to make a sound like the Lingering-Ox and is called the Liu. It lives during the summer and dies in the winter. Eating it will prevent swellings.17 The Liu-Fish can apparently survive out of water. Guo Pu thought that the description of it living in the summer and dying in the winter referred to hibernation.18
10. L E I  ̨ F our hundred li farther east is Mount Chanyuan, which contains many rivers yet no plants or trees. It should not be climbed. There is a beast here whose form resembles a wildcat with a mane. It is called the Lei and is both male and female. Eating it will cure jealousy.19 The name Lei can mean “category,” “species,” or, perhaps in this case, “gender.” Jealousy was considered a particular problem among women in traditional China’s polygamous society. The ability of the Lei to prevent jealousy appears to be connected to its hermaphroditism. The Chinese were particularly fascinated by such animals, for the presence of both yin and yang natures suggested not only nondependence and personal autonomy but also exceptional fertility. Other early texts also mention the Lei such as the philosophical work Master Zhuang (Zhuangzi, late 3rd–1st cent. b.c.e.), which praised it as living in accordance with the Daoist Way because it was capable of e ortless self-fertilization. The commentator Yang Shen (1488–1559) noted the existence of a similar animal in Menghua, Yunnan, which the locals called
86 PLATES II–III



the Fragrant-Mane. Hao Yixing believed that the Lei was similar to another strange beast known as the Divine-Wildcat. He further noted that in 1803, a Mongolian o‹cial who had come to Beijing described a hairy, hermaphroditic animal like a dog that inhabited a tribal area along the Manchurian-Mongolian border. Hao cited this fact as proof of the essential factuality of the Guideways.20
PLATE IV
11. B O S H I TMY Three hundred li farther east is Foundation Mountain, where much jade can be found on its south slope and many strange trees on its north. There is a beast here whose form resembles a goat with nine tails and four ears, with its eyes on its back. It is called the Boshi. Wearing part of it from the belt will prevent fear.21 Guo Pu’s encomium on the Boshi stated that it was specifically its skin that was worn as a talisman, perhaps because the dictionary Explanations and Analyses of Graphs refers to displaying the skin of a sheep to frighten oxen and horses. Hao Yixing cited another view

of the power of goats and sheep from the early medical text The Divine Farmer’s Classic of Remedies (Shennong bencaojing, late 3rd cent. b.c.e.) where the horn of the Gu, a black ram, is recommended for frightening o demons, tigers, and wolves as well as to eliminate fright.22
12. C H A N G F U - B I R D ( C H A N G F U ) ij There is a bird dwelling here on Foundation Mountain whose form resembles a chicken with three heads, six eyes, six feet, and three wings. It is called the Changfu. Eating it will prevent sleep.23

ufactured from insects known as gu. The graph appears as early as the Shang oraclebone inscriptions and is a picture of three virulent insects in a container stinging one another, a process that yields an extremely toxic substance. Its many uses and knowledge of its antidotes were associated with wu-shamans and others who were considered masters of black magic.25 Nine-Tail Foxes were generally regarded as auspicious creatures. In one ancient myth, Yu the Great was seeking an omen that he marry and encountered a white fox with nine tails, which he interpreted as a sign that he would be successful. This fox sometimes appears in Han art along with the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275] in her later role as a goddess of immortality at Mount Kunlun. According to the Debates in the White Tiger Hall (Baihutong, late 1st cent. c.e.), the fox’s nine tails symbolize abundant progeny.26
14. G U A N G U A N - B I R D ( G U A N G U A N ) ÈÈ There is a bird here on Green-Hills Mountain whose form resembles a dove and that makes a sound like a man shouting. It is called the Guanguan. Wearing a part of it from the belt will prevent mental confusion.27 The Compendium of Mr. Lü considered this bird’s flesh a delicacy when roasted. The poet Tao Qian (365–427) also celebrated this bird in the twelfth of his “Thirteen Poems upon Reading the Guideways through Mountains and Seas” (Du shanhaijing shisan shou, 422):
On Green-Hills Mountain is a unique bird That speaks and appears of its own accord. It was born to help those in confusion, Not to caution the Noble Man.28
15. R E D R U - F I S H ( C H I R U ) TMa The Eminent River flows forth from Green-Hills Mountain southward into Carp-Wings Lake. Many Red Ru-Fish are found in the lake. It has the basic form of a fish with a human face and makes a sound like a mandarin duck. Eating it will prevent scabies.29 According to another version noted by Guo Pu, eating it will protect against epidemics.30
PLATE V
16. M O U N T A I N G O D ( S H E N )  ́ The ten mountains from the first peak, Shaking Mountain in the Magpie Mountains to Winnower-Tail Mountain, extend 2,950 li in length. The gods of these mountains all have the form of a bird’s body with a dragon’s head. The proper sacrifice to them is an animal of a single color and the burial of a jade blade. The grain o ering is glutinous rice along with a jade disc and unhulled rice. White reeds should be used for the ceremonial mats.31 The gods of each of the guideways in the Guideways through Mountains form distinct groups and often share similar physical features. They must be sacrificed to by representatives of the government, by the local people, and especially by travelers. In earliest times, such a airs were probably carried out by wu-shamans and other ritual specialists. In the background of the illustration is the tip of a roof, which is the artist’s anachronistic vision of a sacrificial temple reflecting the later, more elaborate architectural style of temples. In ancient China, such local altars and shrines were more likely outdoor stages or simple structures.

17. P O W E R C A T ( L I L I ) WO The second guideway through the Southern Mountains begins at Willow Mountain, which faces the Land of Flowing Yellow Sands to the west, Mount Zhubi to the north, and Mount Changyou to the east. The Eminent River flows forth from Willow Mountain southwest into the Red River. In it can be found much white jade and fine grains of cinnabar. There is a beast here whose form resembles a pig with spurs on its feet. It makes a sound like a dog barking. It is called the Lili. If seen by people, it is an omen that there will be much public earthwork construction in the district.32 Riverbeds were considered the primary source of fine jade, and Hao Yixing quoted the philosophical work Master Shi (Shizi, 4th cent. b.c.e.), which states that jade can be found in rivers whose courses are squared, while pearls can be found in those that are rounded. Cinnabar had a variety of ritual uses in ancient China such as helping to preserve the body after burial and marking divinations on oracle bones. Flowing Yellow Sands, according to Hao Yixing, refers to a land in the west inhabited by a people known as the Xin Tribe recorded in chapter 18 or as the Feng Tribe in chapter 11. They are said to dwell in an area of three

hundred li. This is one of several places in the Guideways with rivers named Eminent and Red.33
18. Z H U - B I R D ( Z H U ) } There is a bird dwelling here on Willow Mountain whose form resembles an owl but with human hands instead of feet. It makes a sound similar to a female quail. It is called the Zhu and makes a sound like its name. If seen by people, it is an omen that many o‹cials in the district will be exiled by the ruler.34 Guo Pu associated the Zhu-Bird’s significance with two other evil omens: a comet crossing the sky and the death of a whale amid the waves. In the twelfth of his cycle of thirteen poems on the Guideways, Tao Qian slyly suggested that this bird must have appeared often during the time of King Huai of Chu (r. 328–299 b.c.e.), who, according to tradition, banished the aristocratic o‹cial and tragic poet Qu Yuan (c. 339–c. 278 b.c.e.).35
19. C H A N G Y O U  ̄k Four hundred fifty li to the southeast stands Mount Changyou, which lacks plants and trees, though it contains many rivers. There is a beast here whose form resembles a Yu-Ape with four ears. It is called the Changyou. It makes a sound like a person singing. If seen by people, it is an omen of a great flood in the districts of the commandery.36
20. H U A H U A I ‚w Another three hundred forty li east stands Lofty-Brilliance Mountain, which contains much jade on it southern slope and much metal on its northern slope. There is a beast here whose form resembles a human with pig’s bristles. It dwells in a cave and hibernates in winter. It is called the Huahuai, and it makes a sound like chopping wood. If seen by people, it is an omen that there will be conscription in the district.37 Guo Pu commented that another version states that if the Huahuai is seen, there will be chaos in the district.38
PLATE VI
21. Z H I - P I G ( Z H I ) Ù One thousand six hundred twenty li east is Floating-Jade Mountain. To the north it overlooks Lake Juqu and to the east, the Zhubi River. There is a beast dwelling here whose form resembles a tiger with an ox’s tail. It makes a sound like a barking dog and it is called the Zhi. It is a man-eater.39 Juqu refers to the area later known as the Great Lake in modern Jiangsu. Here, according to Guo Pu, Zhubi is the name of a river rather than the mountain mentioned in no. 17.40
2 2 . Z I - F I S H ( Z I ) r The Broomstraw River emanates from the north side of Floating-Jade Mountain and flows into Lake Juqu. In it are found many Zi-Fish.41 Guo Pu noted that the Zi-Fish is narrow and flat with a long head and reaches a length of more than a foot. He further stated that in his time these fish flourished in the Great Lake and were known as Knife-Fish. Hao Yixing also noted that these fish could be found in the sea. They may be a kind of mullet.42
23. H U A N b Two thousand nine hundred li further east is Mount Xun, which contains much metal on its southern slope and much jade on its northern slope. There is a beast
PLATES V–VI 91



here whose form resembles a goat but without a mouth and which cannot be killed. It is called the Huan.43 According to Hao Yixing, these words mean that it does not die because it does not need to eat and is thus self-su‹cient. The Huan’s complete autonomy and nondependency on nature are an essential part of its strangeness. According to Guo Pu in his encomium, another benefit of not having a mouth is that harmful vapors cannot enter the body.44
24. P O I S O N - E A G L E ( G U D I A O ) ¤J One thousand four hundred li farther east is Mount Luwu, which lacks plants or trees on its heights but contains much metal and minerals. The Zegeng River emanates from it and flows south into the Surging River. There is a beast here named the Gudiao. It has the basic form of an eagle with a horn, and though it makes a sound like a baby, it is a man-eater.45 Curiously, the Guideways classifies the Poison-Eagle as a beast instead of as a bird, perhaps because of its power and malevolence. The portrait in the Wu Renchen edition (1667) consequently depicted this creature with the head of an eagle but with a body resembling a wildcat’s.

It would seem that Mount Luwu is connected with the god Luwu [no. 60], although the text does not specifically indicate this.46
25. M O U N T A I N G O D ( S H E N )  ́ The second guideway through the Southern Mountains from Willow Mountain to Mount Qiwu comprises seventeen mountains along a length of 7,200 li. The gods of these mountains all have a dragon’s body with a bird’s head. The proper sacrifice to them is an animal of a uniform color and a jade disc buried in the earth. The grain o ering is glutinous rice.47
PLATE VII
26. X I - R H I N O C E R O S ( X I ) R The third guideway through the Southern Mountains begins with Mount Tianyu, below which flow many rivers. It should not be climbed. Five hundred li east stands Pray-and-Pass Mountain. Much metal and jade are found on its heights, while below are found many Xi-Rhinoceros along with Si-Rhinoceros [no. 262] and elephants [see no. 267].48 Guo Pu described the Xi-Rhinoceros as resembling a water bu alo with a pig’s head and with elephant’s feet, each foot cleft in three. It has a large belly with three horns on its nose, forehead, and on top, respectively. The smallest horn, which is on its nose, does not fall o and is used to facilitate eating. Because the Xi likes to chew on brambles, it often drools blood. The SiRhinoceros, which is illustrated in chapter 10, is described here by Guo Pu as also like a water bu alo but blue/green with one horn weighing altogether one thousand jin (approx. 1,333 lbs). In early texts, the graphs for both the Xi and Si were used to refer to several animals such as wild oxen, yaks, bu aloes, and rhinoceros, creating some confusion. However, in later periods to the present, both have referred primarily to the rhinoceros, and Guo Pu’s description of the Xi would seem to indicate this animal. Xi-Rhinoceros are illustrated again in chapter 10 [no. 264] and are mentioned in ten places altogether in the Guideways, while the Si-Rhinoceros appears in nine. Guo Pu’s encomiums poke fun at the Xi and Si. The former is derided because of its big nose and the latter because it ironically brings about its own destruction, for its protective hide was found by man to be useful in war.49
27. J U R U - B I R D ( J U R U ) £p There is a bird here on Pray-and-Pass Mountain whose form resembles a Jiao-Duck but with a white head, three feet, and a human face. It makes a sound like its name.50 The Jiao-Duck is said by Guo Pu to be like a wild duck, only smaller with feet close to its tail. It is di erent from the Jiao-Bird [no. 101], though written with the same graph.51
28. T I G E R - D R A G O N ( H U J I A O ) ÍÎ The Yin River emanates from Pray-and-Pass Mountain, flowing southward into the sea. It contains many Tiger-Dragons. The Tiger-Dragon has a fish’s body and a snake’s tail. It makes a sound like a mandarin duck. Eating it prevents swellings and hemorrhoids.52 Guo Pu noted that this particular dragon was a kind of Jiao-Dragon (no. 274), which has four feet and is snakelike. He also considered it one of the strange creatures found in the Long River (Jiangshui, modern Changjiang, also Yangtze). Some later Chinese scholars identified
PLATES VI–VII 93



this creature with various kinds of sharks such as the Cuo-Fish, whose young are said to jump back into their mothers’ wombs at birth out of fear and must be made to come out. A lost source, Records of Strange Things on Land and in Water at Linhai (Linhai shuitu yiwuzhi, n.d.), quoted in the encyclopedia Sources for Beginning Studies (Chuxueji, 713–42), expressed the opinion that the Tiger-Cuo, which may be the same as this fish, was so named because it has yellow and black patterns and its eyes, ears, and teeth resemble a tiger’s; or, according to the same source, because it can metamorphose into a tiger.53
29. T U A N - F I S H ( T U A N Y U ) ≠Ω Three thousand three hundred li farther east is Chicken Mountain, which contains much metal on its heights and much fine cinnabar at its feet. The Black River emanates from it and flows southward into the sea. In it dwell many Tuan-Fish. It has the basic form of a carp, but with hog’s bristles, and makes a sound like a pig. If seen by people, it is an omen of a great drought throughout the world.54

30. Y U - B I R D ( Y U ) 8 Four hundred li east stands Excellent-Hills Mountain, which lacks plants and trees but issues forth a fiery illumination. On its south is a valley called Central Valley from where the Northeast Wind originates. There is a bird here whose form resembles an owl but with a human face, four eyes, and ears. It is called the Yu and makes a sound like its name. If seen by people, it is an omen of a great drought throughout the world.55 Hao Yixing noted several sources mentioning that divine mountains may generate their own fire, which illuminates them.56
31. M O U N T A I N G O D ( S H E N )  ́ The third guideway through the Southern Mountains extends for 6,530 li along fourteen mountains from Mount Tianyu to South Yu-Ape Mountain. The gods of these mountains all have a dragon’s body with a human face. The proper sacrifice to them is a white dog o ered up with a prayer, and the grain o ering is glutinous rice.57 While Guo Pu interpreted this passage to mean that the dog should be o ered up with a prayer, the commentator Bi Yuan (1729–1797) believed that the text here meant that the dog should first be smeared with its own blood. This concludes chapter 1 of the Guideways, which presents the three guideways through the Southern Mountains.58
PLATE VIII
32. X I A N - A N T E L O P E ( X I A N Y A N G ) Úœ The first guideway through the Western Mountains begins with Lotus Mountain, whose first peak is Money-Arrives Mountain. There are many pine trees on its heights and much washing-stone at its feet. There is a beast here whose form resembles an antelope with a horse’s tail that is called the Xianyang. Its fat can cure chapped skin.59 The Xian-Antelope is also found on seven other mountains in the Guideways. According to the ancient glossary Approaching Refinement (Erya, c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.), it is about six feet in size, while the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs states that it has short horns. Guo Pu indicated in his encomium that its tail was red. He considered the Xian-Antelope identical to similar ones known in his time in the Land of the Great Moon Tribe (Dayuezhi, also Indoscythe) in the northwest said to be as large as mules.60
33. T O N G Q U - B I R D ( T O N G Q U ) dÎ Forty-five li west stands Pinecone Mountain, from which the Huo River flows northward into the Wei River. The Huo River contains an abundance of copper. There is a bird here named the Tongqu that has the basic form of a pheasant with a black body and red feet. It can restore wrinkled skin.61 Guo Pu wrote in his encomium that this bird can also quell disasters. Pinecone Mountain is one of the relatively few places in the Guideways whose location may be identified with some certainty. Hao Yixing stated that this mountain, also known as Pine-Bridge Mountain, stands twenty-seven li southeast of the administrative center of Huayin, Shaanxi. He also identified the Huo River as the Libation River. The Guide to Waterways with Commentary (Shuijingzhu, c. 515–24) recorded it as flowing forth from Pinecone Mountain into the Yellow River, which also shares tributaries with the Wei in this area. The Wei River Valley is itself well known for prehistoric towns, and ancient cities were built along its banks, including Xianyang, capital of the Qin, and Chang’an

34. F E I Y I - S N A K E ( F E I Y I ) Œ9 Sixty li farther west stands Greater Lotus Mountain, which is sheer on all four sides. It rises to a height of five thousand ren [approx. forty thousand feet] and covers ten li in area. Neither birds nor beasts can dwell here. There is a snake here called the Feiyi. It has six feet and four wings. If seen by people, it is an omen of a great drought throughout the world.63 Greater Lotus Mountain is located in the southwest of modern Huayin, Shaanxi. It is actually 7,150 feet high and according to a legend was named after its shape. The glossary Approaching Refinement indicates that it was accorded a special status along with three other mountains as early as the Warring States period. By the Han, it was regarded as the Sacred Marchmount of the West and was sacrificed to by imperial courts. It was subsequently associated with various Daoist religious cults and has continued to be a place of hermitage through the present. In his encomium, Guo celebrated the location of the later legend of the Jade

Maiden of the Brilliant Star on the mountain, one of whose peaks bears her name. She is associated with a cult of longevity because she o ers a drink that enables humans to become Transcendents. According to another legend cited by Guo, a Feiyi-Snake was once sighted at the foot of a place called Bright Mountain during the time of the future King Tang of the Shang (trad. r. c. 1574/1557–1547 b.c.e.) and interpreted as an omen of the impending overthrow of the Xia dynasty. The Feiyi-Snake is also found on two other mountains in the Guideways. Although the graphs of its name are similar to those of the Feiyi-Bird [no. 37], they are di erent creatures.64
35. C O N G L O N G μ§ One hundred sixty li farther west is Mount Fuyu, which contains much copper on its southern slope and much iron on its northern slope. There is a tree on its summit called the Striped-Trunk Tree. Its fruit is like dates and can cure deafness. Among its plants are many known as the Veined-Plant, whose form resembles a sunflower but with red blossoms and yellow fruit. Its fruit is shaped like a baby’s tongue. Eating it will cure mental confusion. The Fuyu River emanates from this mountain and flows northward into the Wei. There are many beasts here known as Conglong. Its form resembles a goat with a red mane.65 Hao Yixing noted several later medicinal texts that recommended dates as a cure for deafness.66
36. M I N - B I R D ( M I N ) e Among the birds on Mount Fuyu are many Min-Birds, which resemble the kingfisher but have red beaks. The Min-Bird can protect against fire.67 Guo Pu commented that this bird can protect against fire if raised domestically.68
PLATE IX
37. F E I Y I - B I R D ( F E I Y I ) ŒÚ One hundred thirty li farther west is Eminent Mountain, which contains many Niu-Trees and Jiang-Oak. On its northern slope is much iron, and on its southern slope is much copper. The Yu-Ape River emanates from here and flows northward into the Summoning River. The river contains many Bang-Fish, which have the basic form of turtle and make a sound like a goat. Along its northern banks are arrow-bamboo and edible bamboo. Among the beasts here are many Zuo-Oxen and XianAntelopes. There is also a bird here whose form resembles a quail with a yellow body and a red beak. It is called the Feiyi. Eating it will cure contagious disease, and it can also kill insects.69 Hao Yixing hypothesized that the “insects” killed by eating the FeiyiBird were intestinal worms. Both Eminent Mountain and Yu-Ape River were later recorded in the Guide to Waterways with Commentary, which states that the Yu-Ape River flows into the Summoning River, which eventually flows into the Wei. Guo Pu noted that the Niu-Tree resembles the cherry but with smaller leaves, while the JiangOak was used in manufacturing carriages. In his time the edible bamboo continued to be a popular food whose shoots were eaten in winter. He also noted previously that many wild oxen and goats weighing one thousand jin could be found dwelling on nearby Lesser Lotus Mountain sixty li to the east. He assumed the oxen were descendants of the Zuo-Oxen mentioned in these passages.70

ern slope and a plant here named the Yellow Guan-Plant. Its form resembles that of an ailanthus, while its leaves resemble those of the hemp plant with white flowers and blood-red fruit. Adding it to a bath will cure itching, and it can also cure tumors. The Bamboo River emanates from here and flows northward into the Wei. Along its northern banks grows an abundance of arrow-bamboo and dark-green jade. The Cinnabar River emanates from here and flows southeast into the Luo River. Much rock crystal and many Human-Fish are found in it. There is a beast here whose form resembles a pig but with white bristles with black tips as large as hairpins. It is called the Haozhi.71 The Brave-Pig was regarded by some commentators as a porcupine. Guo Pu noted that it was several feet in length and that it shot its quills at things. However, despite this belief, which is still common today, a porcupine does not shoot its quills from a distance but embeds them in the flesh of those who make direct contact with it. Guo also believed that the Brave-Pig was hermaphroditic. Both the Bamboo River and the Cinnabar River were recorded in the Guide to Waterways with Commentary and lie within the western part of modern Shaanxi province. The Luo River is

an important waterway that flows into modern Henan province and was later the site of the city of Luoyang, a capital of the Han as well as several later dynasties. There are seven places in the Guideways where Human-Fish are said to dwell. This creature is not a merman but a fairly common fish. Guo Pu noted here that it resembles the Ti-Fish and has four “legs,” that is, fins. The text describes it later as making a sound like a baby [see no. 125]. Eating it is recommended to cure delusions. According to Sima Qian’s (c. 145–c. 86 b.c.e.) Historical Records (Shiji, c. 90 b.c.e.), candles were made from the fat of the Human-Fish for the tomb of the First Emperor of Qin (r. 246–210 b.c.e).72
39. N O I S Y - A P E ( X I A O ) : One hundred ninety li farther west stands BlackEwe Station Mountain, from which the Lacquer River emanates and flows northward into the Wei. On the mountain’s heights are many white-cherry trees and Jiang-Oak, while below is an abundance of common bamboo and arrow-bamboo. On its northern slope is much copper, while on its southern slope is much Yingyuan-Jade. There is a beast here whose form resembles a Yu-Ape but with longer arms. It is adept at throwing things and is called the Xiao.73 Guo Pu noted that the Noisy-Ape was also depicted in the Illustrations of Frightening Animals (Weishoutu, n.d.), a work known to him but now lost. The images in this book seem to have circulated independently from those of the Guideways yet apparently overlapped the latter in content to some extent.74
40. T U O F E I - B I R D ( T U O F E I ) —; There is a bird here on Black-Ewe Station Mountain whose form resembles an owl with a human face and one leg called the Tuofei. It appears in wintertime and hibernates in summer. Wearing it against the skin will prevent fear of thunder and lightning.75 Guo Pu noted that it was the feathers of the Tuofei-Bird that were to be worn against the skin.

The Cinnabar River emanates from it and flows north into the Wei. Among the beasts here are many Fierce-Leopards.77 Hao Yixing suggested that South Mountain might be Mount Zhongnan, a well-known site of early ritual importance located to the southwest of modern Xian, Shaanxi. Guo Pu noted that the Fierce-Leopard resembled a bear but was smaller in size with a short, glossy coat of hair. It originates in Shu (modern Sichuan) and eats snakes as well as metal. In another version they are called Fierce-Tigers. Hao thought they were identical to the Mo-Leopard, a white leopard mentioned in other early texts with similar characteristics.78

The Muddy River emanates from it and flows southward into the Accumulation River. Its southern slope contains many grains of cinnabar, and its northern slope contains much silver and yellow gold. On its heights grow many cinnamon trees, and there is also a white rock there known as Yu-Stone, which can be used to poison rats. There is a plant here whose form resembles the Gaobo-Plant. Its leaves are like those of the sunflower but with red undersides. Its name is the No-Veins Plant, and it can be used to poison rats. There is a beast here whose form resembles a deer with a white tail, horse’s hooves, human hands, and four horns. It is called the Yingru.83 According to Guo Pu, Yu-Stone can also be fed to silkworms to fatten them. Hao Yixing noted other sources that describe it as having a bitter taste, giving o heat, preventing water from freezing, and being poisonous to humans and animals. Mathieu considered it a kind of rock salt. Guo also noted that the Gaobo-Plant was fragrant, and Hao identified it with the Gaoben-Plant, a kind of parsley. Regarding the Yingru, Guo stated that its hands were found in front and wrote in an encomium:
The beast, Yingru, stands Resembling a four-antlered deer With horse hooves and human hands And a white tail to the rear. His appears to combine three species As he climbs among rocks and trees.84

On its southern slope is much copper, while on its northern slope is much Shinie-Stone. Among the beasts here are many tigers and leopards as well as Xi- and Si-Rhinoceros. There is a bird here whose form resembles a pheasant with five-colored markings. It is called the Luanniao, and if seen by people, it is an omen that the world will enjoy peace and tranquility.92 The Luan-Bird was regarded since early times as second only to the Feng-Bird and Fenghuang-Bird [nos. 271, 330] among divine birds and has sometimes been confused with them. Scholars have suggested various real birds as possible origins, and its appearance and its significance has varied throughout later Chinese mythology. Like the Feng-Bird, the Luan-Bird is an omen of peace in the world if seen. An early legend perhaps dating from the Warring States period states that the auspicious Luan-Bird was once presented as a tribute by northwestern tribes to King Cheng of the Zhou (r. c. 1042–1006 b.c.e.) to symbolize their submission to his virtuous rule. In chapters 7 and 16 of the Guideways, the Luan-Bird appears in paradisical locations where it is said to sing spontaneously, paralleling the Feng-Bird, which breaks out into a dance. In chapter 11, however, it is described exactly like the Feng-Bird: both wear a red snake on their breast while grasping and treading on snakes; or, in a later passage, they are both said to carry shields [see no. 271]. Explanations and Analyses of Graphs defined it further as born of the sperm of Red-God, a divinity who is not otherwise identified. It notes that the Luan-Bird is basically red with five-colored markings. It has the basic form of a chicken, sings the five standard pitches, and appears when laudatory hymns to rulers are sung. By the Six Dynasties period, however, the Luan-Bird was associated with the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275], who, along with Transcendents, was sometimes represented as flying on it to various paradises.93

53. L I F T E R ( J U F U ) | ̃ The first mountain along the third guideway through the Western Mountains is called Mount Chongwu. It is located south of the Yellow River. To the north, it looks toward Mount Zhongsui, to the south, it looks toward Yao Lake, to the west it looks toward the Great Mountain of the Supreme God’s Fighting Beasts, and to the east it looks toward Yan Gorge. There is a tree growing here with round leaves, white sepals, red blossoms, and black veins. Its fruit is like a Zhi-Citrus, and eating it will help one to produce descendants. There is a beast here whose form resembles a Yu-Ape with leopard and tiger markings on its arms. It is adept at throwing things and is called the Jufu.98
54. M A N M A N - B I R D ( M A N M A N ) ZZ There is a bird here on Mount Chongwu whose form resembles a wild duck with one wing and one eye. It must find a companion in order to fly and is called the Manman. If seen by people, it is an omen of a great flood throughout the world.99 The Manman-Bird is similar to the Shared-Wings Birds mentioned later in chapters 6 and 16 and described there as one green and one red. The latter birds were represented in Han tomb decorations, and this image was eventually domesticated into a popular symbol of conjugal love. However, the ManmanBird here is an evil omen.100
55. D R U M ( G U ) TM Fifteen hundred ten li farther northwest stands Bell Mountain. The son of the god of this mountain is named Drum. He possesses the body of a dragon with a human face. Together with Qinpi, he killed Baojiang on the southern slope of Mount Kunlun. The Supreme God Di then executed them on the eastern part of Bell Mountain known as Yao-Stone Cli . Qinpi then metamorphosed into a Giant E-Hawk [no. 56]. He has the form of an eagle with black markings, a white head, a red beak, and tiger’s claws. The sound he makes is like that of a Morning-Swan. If seen by people, he is an omen of a great war. Drum also metamorphosed into a Jun-Bird. He has the form of an owl with red feet, a straight beak, yellow markings, and a white head. He makes a sound like that of a swan, and if he is seen by people, it is an omen of a great drought in the town.101
The god of Bell Mountain, Drum’s father, is Torch-Darkness, also known as TorchDragon [no. 336]. He is described in chapter 8 as red with a human face and a snake’s body. In the Guideways, as well as in other early myths, he is a god who controls light and dark and wind and rain and who may have been an early sun god. He is also mentioned in the poem “Questions of Heaven” in the Songs of Chu (Chuci: Tianwen, c. 300 b.c.e.) anthology in which a riddle asks, “What land does the sun not reach to? How does Torch-Dragon light it?” There is a linguistic linkage of bell and drum, as in the common expression “bells and drums” (zhonggu), which provides a symbolic logic to Drum’s relationship to this place. He is an example of an evil son of a powerful god who is brought to justice. His ally, Qinpi, is mentioned in other early sources under similar names as another mountain god with a human face and a beast’s body. By contrast, in the Master Zhuang, where he is called Kanpi, he is praised for obtaining the Way and using it to gain control of Mount Kunlun. Their victim, Baojiang, remains unknown. In this passage, the Supreme God, who is probably the Yellow Thearch (Huangdi), plays a characteristic role as the ultimate guarantor of moral and political

ÂØΩ One hundred eighty li farther west is Great Vessel Mountain. The Observation River emanates from it and flows west into the Desert of Shifting Sands. In it dwell many Mottled Flying-Fish. Its form resembles a carp with a fish’s body, bird’s wings, blue-black markings, a white head, and a red mouth. It often courses in the Western Sea and swims to the Eastern Sea. The Mottled Flying-Fish flies by night and makes a sound like a Luan-Chicken. It has a sweet-and-sour taste. Eating it can cure insanity. If seen by people, it is an omen of a bountiful harvest throughout the world.103 The Mottled Flying-Fish was considered another delicacy in The Compendium of Mr. Lü. Its ability to swim or fly from the Western Sea to the Eastern Sea suggests that the Four Seas were regarded as contiguous. The Desert of Shifting Sands refers to the Gobi and other

deserts extending westward into Central Asia, while the Western Sea may indicate one of the rivers or lakes in the area such as the Blue Sea, for large bodies of water beyond the borders of early Chinese civilization could be regarded as “seas.” As for the Eastern Sea, it may indicate the sea to the east of China or, as Hao Yixing suggested, another large body of water in the west. Guo Pu was unable to identify the Luan-Chicken, but Hao believed it to be the same as the Luan-Bird [no. 49], for some sources such as Explanations and Analyses of Graphs describe the latter as a kind of chicken.104
PLATE XIII
58. Y I N G S H A O ^¤ Three hundred twenty li farther west is Sophora River Mountain. The Qiushi River emanates from it and flows north into the You River and contains many snails. On the mountain’s heights is much green realgar, the finest quality of Langgan-Stone, yellow gold, and jade. On its southern slope are many grains of cinnabar, while on its northern slope are much glittering yellow gold and silver. This place is actually the location of the Supreme God’s Garden of Peace. Yingshao is in charge of it. His form resembles the body of a horse with a human face, tiger’s stripes, and bird’s wings. Yingshao travels a circuit through the Four Seas and makes a sound like reading books aloud. This mountain provides a view south toward Mount Kunlun, whose aura is fiery brilliant and whose energy is powerfully abundant. To the west is a view of the Grand Lake where Lord Millet (Houji) is buried. In the middle of it is much jade, while along its southern banks are many giant Yao-Trees from whose tops grow many Ruo-Trees. To the north is a view of Mount Zhubi, where the Sophora Tree Demon, Lilun, resides. It is also the dwelling place of hawks and falcons. To the east is a view of the four levels of Constancy Mountain. The Exhausted Demons reside here, each group occupying a corner of the mountain.105
As the guideway approaches Mount Kunlun, the mountains in the vicinity partake of the spiritual power of this axis mundi. This is reflected in the increased number of rare objects and strange creatures at Sophora River Mountain, just four hundred li to the northeast, as well as on those mountains that can be seen from it. Langgan-Stone is a rare, highly valued mineral that Guo Pu stated resembled pearl. The glossary Approaching Refinement considered the Langgan-Stone on nearby Mount Kunlun to be the finest. The Ruo-Tree is a divine tree also said to grow at the Western Extremity, where the sun sets, and is described in chapter 17 as red with green leaves and red blossoms. Like Kunlun, this mountain is also directly connected with the Supreme God, who possesses a garden here administered by Yingshao. Commentators from Guo Pu on have identified it with the mythical Dark Garden, also known as the Suspended Garden, both of which are mentioned in several early texts, though they are usually located on Mount Kunlun. Guo Pu noted that Lord Millet underwent a metamorphosis in the Grand Lake after his death and became its god, while Hao Yixing assumed that this place was Lord Millet Lake mentioned earlier along this guideway at Secret Mountain. However, the Guideways also records two other burial sites for Lord Millet. Nothing further is known about Lilun and the Exhausted Demons. Guo Pu considered the latter a generic name for various types.106
59. A C E L E S T I A L G O D ( T I A N S H E N ) — ́ At Sophora River Mountain there is also the Overflowing River, whose water is clear and flows freely. There is a

60. L U W U ∞^ Four hundred li farther southwest is Mount Kunlun. It is actually the earthly capital of the Supreme God Di. The god Luwu administers it. His divine form resembles a tiger’s body with nine tails, a human face, and tiger’s claws. This god administers the nine regions of heaven as well as the cycle of four seasons in the Supreme God’s garden.108 Mount Kunlun, the most important mountain in early Chinese mythology, is mentioned in several other entries in the Guideways but is described most fully here. Guo Pu, in his encomium, called it a Pillar of Heaven. Four rivers, the Yellow, Red, Black, and Oceanic Rivers, are said to emanate from it, and it abounds in strange beasts and birds. Among the strange flora is a tree called the Sand-Pear with yellow blossoms and red, pitless fruits that taste like plums. This fruit was considered one of the finest delicacies in The Compendium of Mr.

Lü. It can protect against floods. Whoever eats it will not drown, because the wood of the tree was believed to be unsinkable. The Pin-Plant also found here has the form of a sunflower and tastes like scallions. It may be a kind of duckweed or mallow and was considered one of the finest vegetables in The Compendium. Eating it will cure fatigue. In addition to the Tulou [no. 61] and the Qinyuan-Bird [no. 62] mentioned below, there is also a bird named the Quail-Bird, which is in charge of the hundred storehouses of Di. It is thought by some commentators to be a kind of Feng-Bird [nos. 271, 330]. Another strange creature often located on the mountain but not mentioned here is the BeastFacing-East [no. 269]. As described in chapter 11, it has a large tiger’s body and nine human heads and also serves as a guardian. Guo Pu considered it a specific beast who guards the gates to the mountain, but Yuan Ke suggested that it may have been regarded as identical to Luwu. The “nine regions” of heaven probably refer to the astronomical sectors of the sky believed to be controlled by divine stars and constellations. While some Handynasty depictions of Mount Kunlun represent a Nine-Tail Fox, Luwu seems to have disappeared from the pantheon in later Chinese mythology, which established the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275] as the dominant goddess of Kunlun.109

On the heights of this mountain is found much jade, while at its feet is much Green-Stone. There are no rivers.114 The Nine Powers of Heaven have not been identified, but Guo Pu stated in his encomium that Long-Ride was born from their energies and embodies their mystery. The Zhuo-Leopard appears in two other places in the Guideways, and later sources have described it as a kind of leopard with or without spots. Green-Stone has not yet been further identified. An earlier reader who wrote in the names of some of the strange creatures next to the images mistakenly confused the image of Long-Ride

65. Q U E E N M O T H E R O F T H E W E S T ( X I W A N G M U ) Ë ̋¿ Three hundred fifty li farther west is Jade Mountain. This is where the Queen Mother of the West dwells. The Queen Mother of the West resembles a human with a leopard’s tail and tiger’s teeth. She is adept at whistling and wears a Sheng-Crown on top of her unkempt hair. She administers calamities from heaven as well as five punishments.116 This is probably the earliest surviving description of this goddess. She appears here as dwelling not on Mount Kunlun, where she was later located, but on nearby Jade Mountain. According to Guo Pu, the mountain takes its name from its abundance of jade. Her skillful whistling may be a shamanistic technique used for summoning gods and demons, and this image is underscored by her unkempt hair. Her distinctive Sheng-Crown, which Guo believed was made of jade, has been represented as two discs connected by a rod. While Guo Pu commented that the phrase “calamities of heaven as well as five pun
PLATE XIV 109
66

ishments” meant that the Queen Mother commanded disasterous and murderous energies, Hao Yixing argued that this referred to two stars named “Calamities” and “Five Punishments.” The Queen Mother thus initially appears as a fearsome, avenging goddess. She makes another notable appearance in The Chronicle of King Mu (Mutianzi zhuan, Warring States–c. 4th cent. c.e.), where she receives the touring Zhou dynasty king in her domain in the west and responds to his ritual song with two of her own. Guo Pu’s encomium on her refers to the events of this text, and he interprets a line from it to mean that she is a daughter of the Supreme God. By the Han dynasty, she was recorded as dispensing immortality, usually on Mount Kunlun, and was also paired with the King Father of the East as symbols of yin-and-yang cosmology. Widely represented in Han tomb art, she usually appears as a human rather than as a hybrid, sometimes with some of the creatures mentioned in the Guideways. In a further phase of development, her image underwent even more refinement in religious Daoism, becoming by the Tang dynasty a beautiful goddess dispensing peaches of immortality to various humanized gods and Transcendents at the Yao-Stone Pool on Mount Kunlun [see no. 275].117
66. J I A O - B E A S T ( J I A O ) æ There is a beast dwelling here on Jade Mountain whose form resembles a dog with leopard’s markings and horns like an ox’s. It is called the Jiao, and it makes a sound like a barking dog. If it is seen by people, it is an omen of a bountiful harvest throughout the state.118 Guo Pu noted that closer to his own time in 286 c.e., a similar beast was trapped in Fuyi, Shaoling (modern Yancheng, Henan). It had leopard spots and two horns but lacked front feet. Although people regarded it at the time as a Jiao-Beast, Guo doubted that it was the same animal.119

If seen by people, it is an omen of an inexplicable fire in the town.122 The Bifang-Bird appears in two di erent traditions in early mythology. In the Master Hanfei (Hanfeizi, before 233 b.c.e.), it is an auspicious, divine creature that accompanied the Yellow Thearch’s carriage when he traveled through the sky to an assembly of gods and demons on the Supreme Mountain. Here though, it appears as an evil omen associated with fire. Later,
110 PLATES XIV–XV



in the Master of Huainan (Huainanzi, c. 139 b.c.e.), it is said to be born from wood, one of the Five Agents, and is wood’s divine essence. It was also represented among the engravings on the walls of the Wu Liang Shrine (c. 151 c.e.). Guo Pu’s encomium reiterates the image of the Bifang-Bird as a dangerous bearer of fire and suggests that this characteristic is related to its red color. It appears again in chapter 6 [see no. 216].123

It can repel evil forces.124 Guo Pu’s encomium states that the Celestial-Dog is small in size and can aid the ruler in repelling evil if eaten or worn from the belt as a talisman. He also wrote about the cowrie shells, observing that they were considered valuable and often used as money in ancient China based on their markings and size.125

On its heights dwells a beast whose form resembles an ox but with a white body, four horns, and hair like the straw used in rain capes. Its is called the Aoyin and is a man-eater.126 Various commentators believed that this Three-Dangers Mountain is the one located near the later Caves of the Thousand Buddhas in modern Dunhuang, Gansu. It is said to have three peaks, which accounts for its name. Elsewhere in Chinese mythology, a mountain with this name is also mentioned as the place where the Three-Sprouts People [see nos. 218, 313, 335] were exiled after their revolt against the thearch Shun (trad. r. 2042–1993 b.c.e.) was quelled. They were a confederation of southern tribes that advanced northward during the Neolithic period and were said to have been defeated by various thearchs during the third millennium b.c.e. The Three Green-Birds [no. 276] are later recorded in chapters 12 and 16 as bringing food to the Queen Mother of the West. Perhaps they, along with the Three-Sprouts People, were associated with this mountain because of the symbolic significance of the number three.127
72. C H I - B I R D ( C H I ) Æ There is a bird here on Three-Dangers Mountain with one head and three bodies whose form resembles a Lo-Bird. It is called the Chi.128 Guo Pu noted that the Lo-Bird was like an eagle but with black markings and a red throat. The Chi-Bird’s three bodies seem a further example of the motif of three at this mountain.129
73. D I J I A N G “ø Five hundred forty li farther west stands Celestial Mountain. It contains an abundance of metal and jade, and there is green realgar. The Eminent River emanates from it and flows southwest into Hot Valley. There is a god here whose form resembles a yellow sack with a red aura like cinnabar. He has six legs and four wings and exists in a state of confusion with no face or eyes. He knows how to sing and dance for he is, in fact, Dijiang.130 Several other versions of this passage classify Dijiang as a divine bird, which may be explained by his ability to sing and dance like the Luan- and Feng-Birds. Through various lines of associative reasoning and linguistic connections, Dijiang has been seen by commentators as related or identical to a personification of cosmogonic chaos known as Hundun. This conclusion is largely based on reading the line “[he] exists in a state of confusion (hundun)” as the proper name Hundun. Hundun most notably appears in a fable in the Master Zhuang, though there his name is written with a variant graph:
The thearch of the Southern Sea was named “Sudden,” the thearch of the Northern Sea was named “Hasty,” and the thearch of the Center was named “Hundun.” Once Sudden and Hasty together paid a visit to Hundun’s domain and were treated most courteously by him. They discussed among themselves how to repay his generosity saying, “All men have seven orifices to see, hear, eat, and breathe. Only he does not. Why not drill them for him?” Every day, they drilled one hole, but after seven days, Hundun died.
Here Hundun can be read as a figure of primordial chaos who is a victim of purposeful activity, destroyed by the well-intentioned though dangerously misguided e orts of

The fable thus reflects the philosopher’s nostalgia for a golden age of primitive society when all life was believed to be in accord with the simple patterns of the natural Way (Dao). It is tempting to see the image of Dijiang as that of the undi erentiated cosmos. His four wings, six legs, and lack of face and eyes indicate directionless movement. His sacklike physique encompassing emptiness suggests creation myths in which the universe comes into existence from the body of a god. There is another historiographical tradition in Zuo’s Narratives to the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu zuozhuan, c. late 4th cent. b.c.e.) in which Hundun is the evil son of Thearch Hong (Dihong). He is called Hundun, that is, Confusion, because of his lack of moral consciousness. As one of four evil o spring of thearchs, Hundun is finally banished along with the rest by Shun, who sends them all to the periphery to quell demons. Following another line of linguistic reasoning, Yuan Ke (1916–) conflated both traditions by identifying Dijiang with Thearch Hong and also with the Yellow Thearch, the latter considered the Thearch of the Center in Five Agents cosmology. Hundun continued as a personified form into the Han and early Six Dynasties period, when he was canonized as part of various sets of gods; thereafter his image seems to have disappeared from religious pantheons. However, Hundun survived in later Chinese thought as an abstract term denoting an impersonal state of universal chaos before the birth of the bipolar forces yin and yang. It is in this sense that Guo Pu understands him in his encomium by stating that the figure Dijiang is, in substance, cosmic confusion. Despite all these ingenious and suggestive readings, the textual basis in this passage of the Guideways for identifying Dijiang (literally, Thearch Long River) with the mythical figure Hundun is slim, and he can simply be regarded as a strange creature in his own right.131

74. R U S H O U Ω ̈ Two hundred ninety li farther west is Mount You. The god Rushou dwells here. On its heights is much Yingduan-Jade. On its southern slope is much Jinyu-Jade, while on its northern slope is much green realgar. This mountain has a view to the west of the place where the sun sets. The sun’s appearance is round, and the god RedGlow (Hongguang) administers it.132 Yingduan-Jade has been identified with Yingyuan-Jade [see no. 39], a kind of jade suitable for wearing as a necklace. Jinyu-Jade remains unidentified, although it appears in other early texts as a precious stone. Rushou is an ancient god with roots in Shang-dynasty beliefs. Guo Pu described him as the god of metal in Five Agents cosmology with a human face, tiger’s claws, and a white tail and who holds a yue-ax, symbolizing his authority to execute others. In chapter 7, Rushou is described again, this time as wearing a snake through his left ear and riding on two dragons, the latter motif typical of divine figures who can travel between heaven and earth [see no. 241]. Guo commented here that he had white hair instead of a white tail indicating, perhaps, a misprint in the text. During the Eastern Zhou, Rushou was paired with another god, Goumang, as brothers representing the west and east, respectively. He was also identified as the god of punishments, hence the yue-ax of execution. Early historians connected him to the thearch Lesser-Brilliance (Shaohao) either genealogically or bureaucratically. His cult continued to be o‹cially supported in the Han, though it began to decline by the end of the dynasty. There was a brief revival as late as the

There is a beast dwelling here whose form resembles a wildcat with one eye and three tails. It is called the Huan, and it is capable of uttering all kinds of sounds. This creature can repel evil forces. If a piece is worn against the skin, it will cure jaundice.134

Wearing a piece of it against the skin will prevent nightmares. It can also repel evil.135 Guo Pu’s encomium noted that both the Yiyu-Bird and the Huan [no. 75] possess features in multiples of three, which may be why this bird is also said to repel evil.136

There are no plants or trees on its heights but many huge rocks. At its feet grow many hazelnut trees and arrow-thorn bushes. Among the beasts here are many white deer, and among the birds are many Danghu-Birds. The Danghu-Bird’s form resembles a pheasant, and it flies by means of its throat feathers. Eating it will prevent the deterioration of eyesight. The Hot River emanates from this mountain and flows east into the Yellow River.138 In his encomium, Guo Pu regarded the way this bird flies as exemplifying the minimalist spirit of the Daoist philosophical text The Old Master (Laozi, late 3rd cent. b.c.e.) by alluding to it in the last two lines:
Most birds fly with their wings. Whiskers su‹ce for the Danghu. It employs the sparse and eschews the many Yet has more than enough to make do. As the hub allows a wheel to turn on cue, From emptiness does the greatest use ensue.139
79. C H U I - S P I R I T ( S H E N C H U I )  ́4 One thousand three hundred five li farther northwest stands Hard Mountain, which contains many lacquer trees and much Tufou-Jade. The Hard River emanates from it and flows northward into the Wei. Here are found many Chui-Spirits. The Chui-Spirit’s form resembles a human face on a beasts’s body with a single foot and a single hand. It makes a sound like chanting.140 TufouJade remains unidentified. Guo Pu considered the Chui-Spirits a kind of Chimei-Hobgoblin [see no. 287], a class of malevolent demons that were popularly believed to dwell in dark, hidden places in the landscape such as marshes, forests, or mountains, causing danger for unwary travelers.141
80. M A N M A N ZZ Two hundred li farther west stands the tail of Hard Mountain. The Luo River emanates from it and flows northward into the Yellow River. Many Manman dwell in it. The Manman’s form resembles a rat’s body with a turtle’s head, and it makes a sound like a dog barking.142 Hao Yixing believed that this Manman was a kind of beaver or otter. Though written with the same graphs, it is di erent from the Manman-Bird [no. 54].143

The Ranyi-Fish has the body of a fish with a snake’s head, six feet, and eyes like a horse’s ears. Eating it will prevent blindness. It can also repel evil forces.144
82. B O a Three hundred li farther west stands Mount WindingCenter. There is much jade on its southern slope and much realgar, white jade, and metal on its northern slope. There is a beast dwelling here whose form resembles a horse but with a white body, black tail, a single horn, and tiger’s teeth and claws. It makes a sound like a drum and is called the Bo. The Bo devours tigers and leopards. It can also protect against weapons. There is a tree growing here that resembles a wild plum but with round leaves and red fruit that is as large as a papaya. It is called the Huai-Tree, and eating of it will increase one’s strength.145 Guo Pu noted that the Bo specifically protects against weapons if domesticated.

83. T H O R O U G H L Y - O D D ( Q I O N G Q I ) a_ Two hundred sixty li farther west stands Mount Gui. There is a beast dwelling on its heights whose form resembles an ox with the needles of a Wei-Porcupine. It is called Qiongqi and makes a sound like a dog howling. It is a man-eater.147 Thoroughly-Odd is said to devour people who wear their long hair untied, a style characteristic of demons and shamans. The victims are consumed beginning with the head. According to another version, they are consumed beginning with the feet, which may have been reflected in di erent early illustrations. Thoroughly-Odd was historicized as another untalented son of a thearch, Lesser-Brilliance, in the same passage of Zuo’s Narratives that mentioned Hundun [see no. 73]. Like Hundun, he later became a fierce god in the Han. The Master of Huainan states that he was born from the Northern Desert Wind. He was one of twelve divinities who were invoked in the o‹cial Grand Exorcism held at the end of the lunar year in the imperial palace. Specifically, he ate insect-poison, thus indicating a beneficial aspect. Thoroughly-Odd also appears again in chapter 12 [no. 283], where he is described as resembling a tiger with wings. A later expanded description in the Guideway to Gods and Anomalies (Shenyijing, Western Han–Six Dynasties), however, presents ThoroughlyOdd as a perverse creature who devours those who are loyal and trustworthy but o ers freshly killed meat to the evil and rebellious. Perhaps because an alternate version of this text describes him as having a human body with a dog’s head and as making a sound like a dog, Guo Pu in an encomium pronounced him a “divine dog.”148

The Wei River emanates from here and flows east into the Yellow River. In it dwell many Sao-Fish. The Sao-Fish resembles a sturgeon, and when it swims about, it is an omen of a great army arriving in the town.149 According to Guo Pu, the mountain is home to the Tu-Rat, which resembles the common household rat though with a short tail, and the Tu-Bird, which resembles a yellow swallow. They share a burrow three or four feet deep, indicated in the upper right. The rat is said to dwell within and the bird outside in front. Other early sources state that they are either hermaphroditic or without gender. Guo marveled in his encomium that they achieved domestic harmony although they were seemingly unsuited to each other by nature.150
85. R U P I - F I S H ( R U P I Z H I Y U ) CDßΩ The Flooding River emanates from the west of the Mountain Where Bird and Rat Share a Hole and flows westward into the Han River.

It makes a sound like stone chimes and gives birth to pearls and jade.151 The illustration seems

to have been mislabeled by an earlier reader who wrote in the name Luo to indicate the Luo-Fish. The Luo-Fish appears earlier as dwelling in the Misty River, which emanates from Mount Gui [see no. 83]. It has the body of a fish with bird’s wings and makes a sound like a mandarin duck. It is an evil omen, for if seen by people there will be a great flood in the town. Though both fishes have wings, the illustration clearly indicates a bird’s head, which only the Rupi-Fish possesses.152

It is not quite clear just why the Shuhu likes to lift people up, though Guo Pu’s comment and encomium suggest that it does so as a sign of a ection.154

Eating it will cure melancholy.159 An alternate version of this passage preserved in the encyclopedia Ocean of Jade (Yuhai, 1266) states that these fish have four eyes instead of four heads, and they are depicted thus in the Wu Renchen edition portrait. Hao Yixing noted that in his own time, the Cantonese prized a similar fish also known as the Shu, which he believed to be the same. This fish resembled a chicken with soft scales and with multiple feet and tails, the latter resembling eight belts. They considered it a delicacy when salted and often preserved it for long periods.160

Eating it will cure tumors.161 Yang Shen wrote in his Encomiums on Strange Fish (Yiyu tuzan, 1544) that the Heluo-Fish transformed itself into a bird known as the Never-Old, which stole rice kernels from the pestle during threshing, only to fall into the mortar and die. It also would let out a cry when it flew by at night and was said to be scared o by thunder. Other commentators have suggested that perhaps this is the same as a tenheaded bird known as the Guhuo and also as the Demon’s Carriage.162

Among the beasts here are many Camels.167 The Camel normally dwells in the deserts of the northwest and west and was often seen on caravans traveling through northern China. Its inclusion in these illustrations indicates that in the Ming, it was still regarded as an exotic species, especially in the central and southern parts of the country. Guo Pu noted that it has a humped back and is adept at traveling in the desert. It is capable of covering three hundred li in a day and carries heavy loads of one thousand jin. He also praised its mysterious ability to locate subterranean water. Among caravan travelers through the desert, it was also valued for its ability to warn of oncoming sandstorms by burying its face in the sand. The Ju-Tree is said by Guo to be the Kui-Tree, whose wood grows in joints and is useful for making staves.168

It is called the Ershu, and eating it can reduce swelling of the abdomen. It can also protect against all kinds of poison.171 According to other versions of this passage in later texts, the Ear-Rat has the ears rather than the body of a Mi-Deer and flies by means of its whiskers rather than by its tail. However, Hao Yixing considered it similar to the Wu-Rat mentioned in the glossary Approaching Refinement. He described it as a kind of flying squirrel also known as the Tail-Flyer and stated that the flesh of its wings was connected to its feet and tail; hence, it only appeared to fly with its tail. In later medicinal texts, the Wu-Rat is said to be e‹cacious in childbirth if the pregnant woman grasps hold of its fur during delivery, which may be related to the Ear-Rat’s e ect on swollen abdomens.172

The people who live in the Northern Mountains all eat raw food and do not engage in cooking.198 Hao Yixing supported this last statement by citing The Elder Dai’s Book of Ritual (Dadai liji, c. 2nd cent. b.c.e.–early 2nd cent. c.e.), which recorded the belief that peoples dwelling in the distant regions along the four directions do not cook their food, as well as the Master of Huainan, which stated that the Di-Barbarians in the north do not eat grains.199

In the Han dynasty, the Qilin emerged as a primary figure of this type. Its appearance was regarded as an auspicious political omen, and it became one of the four benevolent creatures in folklore. Curiously, though already recorded in other Zhou-dynasty texts, the Qilin is hardly mentioned in the Guideways.201

It makes a sound like a baby and is called the Paoxiao. It is a man-eater.202 Guo Pu associated the Paoxiao with the Taotie, an ancient mythical animal, which The Compendium of Mr. Lü stated was depicted on bronze vessels as a head without a body. It noted that the Taotie was supposed to be inclined toward greediness and harmed its own body before it could fully consume its human prey, which thereby gained a measure of revenge against this predator. However, the Paoxiao’s features di er from decorations on bronzes, which scholars have conventionally called the “Taotie mask,” and Guo’s theory seems historically questionable. Nevertheless, he also believed that the Paoxiao had been depicted even earlier on the vessels of Yu the Great, and he expanded on these themes in his encomium:
How gluttonous is the Paoxiao! Behind his forelegs are his eyes. He cannot finish his human chow Before biting himself to gourmandize. Though also depicted on marvelous vessels, Those images are said to be contrariwise.203

She is the younger daughter of the Flame Thearch named Nüwa. Nüwa was swimming in the Eastern Sea when she was unable to return to shore and drowned. She then transformed into the bird Spirit-Guardian and regularly carries twigs and stones from the Western Mountains to fill up the Eastern Sea. The Zhang River emanates from here and flows eastward into the Yellow River.222 One of the relatively few goddesses recorded in ancient Chinese mythology, Spirit-Guardian’s story has been seen as exemplifying the motifs of pathos, revenge, and, perhaps, punishment for trespassing in the territory of a sea god. The poet Tao Qian expressed sympathy with her plight in the tenth of his cycle of poems on reading the Guideways but saw her desire for revenge as ultimately futile. Later she was considered by Daoists to have become a Transcendent. In modern China, she has been popularized as a symbol of someone refusing to accept defeat.223

It was sacrificed to in the state religion from the Zhou dynasty on. Over the centuries, it became the most venerated of sacred Chinese mountains and was regarded as the Marchmount of the East. It was also the center of a cult of Transcendents promoted by fangshi-wizards that attracted rulers to make pilgrimages and o er sacrifices, beginning with the First Emperor of Qin in 219 b.c.e. In later popular religion, near its location was the entrance to the underworld, where dead souls were admitted and judged. Curiously, it is not accorded any special status in the Guideways, supporting the view of some scholars that the text presents a religious view more characteristic of Western rather than of Eastern China or of late Chu.

Although illustrated here with two eyes, in later illustrations such as the Wu Renchen portrait, it appears with four eyes. Later textual sources mention a similar creature that has four eyes and spits out pearls, so Hao Yixing suggested that perhaps the text here originally indicated four eyes.242

Although generally willing to serve loyally any ruler who would employ them, they also included spies, assassins, tricksters, and those who engaged in the numerous intrigues recorded in the literature of the Warring States. The art of correctly judging character was thus a valued, though often elusive, skill that no one in power could a ord to neglect.

It makes a sound like its name and if seen is an auspicious omen of a bountiful harvest throughout the world.269 Hao Yixing cited the Guideway to Gods and Anomalies, which describes a similar beast in the south known as the No-Loss, which resembles a deer but has a pig’s head with tusks. Enjoy-Abundance likes to follow people around as it searches for leftover grains to feed on. He also hypothesized that there was a phonological connection between the name Dangkang and its signfying a bountiful harvest, pronounced “darang.”270

There is a beast here whose form resembles a pig but with a human face, a yellow body, and a red tail. It is called the Heyu, and it makes a sound like a baby. However, this beast is a man-eater, and it also devours reptiles and snakes. If seen, it is an omen of a great flood throughout the world.272 Hao Yixing noted that this creature as an evil omen of floods is particularly strange from the viewpoint of later Five Agents cosmology in which the symbolic animal “pig” is auspiciously correlated with the water element. However, pigs were generally known to eat snakes.273

Water evaporates when it travels through it, and grass dies when it walks through it. If seen, it is an omen of a great plague throughout the world. The Hook River emanates from here and flows northward into the Toiling River. In it dwell many Qiu-Fish.274 The graph zhen identified as the ligustrum tree signifies endurance and was defined in Explanations and Analyses of Graphs as indicating the hardness of its wood. Guo Pu, however, associated the name with female chastity, a more extended meaning, and stated that its leaves remain intact throughout the winter. Great Mountain is the last of the eight mountains along the fourth and final guideway through the Eastern Mountains, stretching for 1,720 li.

According to one of them, the Record of Knives and Swords (Daojianlu, n.d.), a sword was cast and thrown into the river to quell him in 83 c.e. during the reign of Emperor Zhang of the Eastern Han (r. 75–88 c.e.).285

On its southern slope is much Tufou-Jade, and on its northern slope are much red earth and yellow gold. The god Smoky-Lake (Xunchi) dwells here. This place often produces fine jade. To the north it provides a view of the forests along the Yellow River, whose trees resemble the form of madder bushes and willows. There is a beast here whose form resembles a white deer but with four horns. It is called the Fuzhu. If seen, it is an omen of a great flood in the town.286 The god Smoky-Lake is not described in this passage but was represented by the artist in the next plate as no. 180. However, the text notes at the end of this guideway that, along with the gods Warrior-Net [no. 176] and Peaceful-Encounter [no. 179], he is important enough to require special sacrifices, as mentioned below.

Northward, it provides a view of the winding course of the Yellow River. Here are many Jia-Birds. Southward, it provides a view of Shan Island. This is where the father of Yu the Great underwent a metamorphosis. Here there are many snails. The god Warrior-Net administers this place. He resembles a human face but with leopard markings, a small waist, white teeth, and he wears earrings. Warrior-Net makes a sound like tinkling jade. This mountain is beneficial for producing daughters.287 Guo was unable to identify the Jia-Bird exactly but hypothesized that it might be a kind of goose. He also noted that in another version, Warrior-Net is described as having a white face instead of white teeth. The commentator Yuan Ke suggested that such characteristics as a narrow waist and white teeth usually denote the feminine and that Warrior-Net was actually a mountain goddess despite the name. The theme of fertility and the e ects of the flora and fauna mentioned below [see no. 177] may further support this. For the proper sacrifice to Warrior-Net, see no. 180.

is said here to have metamorphosed on Shan Island, a fuller version of his myth is recorded as the final passage in the Guideways in chapter 18 [see no. 345]. Various other myths record Gun as both a failed hero and a criminal. He is said to have metamorphosed into a yellow bear, a yellow dragon, or a black fish after being executed, then was restored to life by wu-shamans. Guo Pu attempted to reconcile these discrepancies by stating that after Gun metamorphosed the first time as a yellow bear, he was capable of undergoing similar changes anywhere else. Hao Yixing believed that this entire passage must have been interpolated later, since he accepted the traditional attribution of the Guideways to Yu the Great, who would not have referred to himself and his father in this way.288

It is actually the place where nine tributaries of the Yellow River converge and where the mountain winds about to form five folds. Nine rivers emanate from here. They converge and flow northward into the Yellow River. In them is found much darkgreen jade. The auspicious god Peaceful-Encounter is in charge of this place. His form resembles a human but with a tiger’s tail. He likes to dwell on the southern slopes of the Bei Mountains, and a blazing light issues forth whenever he comes and goes. The god Peaceful-Encounter can activate the vapors of heaven and earth.292 The sacrifice to Peaceful-Encounter is the same as that for Warrior-Net [no. 176] described above, as well as for Smoky-Lake [no. 180]. The Compendium of Mr. Lü recorded an incident about the Xia dynasty ruler Kongjia (trad. r. c. 1611–1603 b.c.e.) who was farming at the foot of the Bei Mountains and was forced to seek refuge in a peasant’s cottage when the weather there suddenly changed and strong winds turned the sky dark. Both Guo Pu and Hao Yixing attributed this change to the local god Peaceful-Encounter’s power over the weather.293

The remaining two gods require a rooster, which is buried, and, for the grain sacrifice, glutinuous rice is used.294

Eating it will cure Dian-Sickness.301 Head Mountain is located in modern Yanshi, Henan, and was considered one of the five illustrious mountains of antiquity visited by the Yellow Thearch. According to Hao Yixing, its name indicates that it formed the head of a system of illustrious mountains, which included Greater Lotus Mountain [see no. 34]. The brothers Boyi and Shuqi, righteous Shang aristocrats, are said to have starved themselves to death here rather than serve the founders of the succeeding Zhou dynasty. Zhu(Atractylodis macrocephalae) and Yuan-Herbs (Daphne genkwa) are still used in Chinese medicine. The Ji-Tree was identified earlier by Guo Pu as a kind of elm. Dian-Sickness remains unidentified; however, Wang Fu and Hao Yixing suggested that it meant weakness from humidity.302

There is a god here whose form resembles a human but with two heads named Jiaochong. He is the chief of stinging insects, and this mountain is actually the dwelling place of bees. The proper sacrifice to him is a rooster, which is o ered up with a prayer but is not killed.303 This Grain-Citadel Mountain is believed to be the same one north of the Relief River where the Western Han dynasty strategist Zhang Liang (d. 189 b.c.e.) found a yellow rock. Zhang kept the rock with him and worshiped it throughout his life. One of the key advisors to Liu Bang (c. 247–195 b.c.e.), founder of the Han dynasty, Zhang was later buried with this rock, which was subsequently sacrificed to during the spring and summer solstices. Yuan Ke located Grain-Citadel Mountain in modern Donge District, Shandong. Guo Pu suggested that the ritual for Proud-Bug involved prayers to exorcise calamities, and Wang

Lü-Goats are mentioned in at least six other places in the Guideways and are particularly abundant in the mountains of this area. Guo Pu earlier noted that the Lü is a kind of Black-Ewe but resembles a donkey with split hooves, while its horns resemble those of the Ling-Antelope [see no. 48].

Compendium of Mr. Lü that credits the Tuo-Alligator with being the first musician. Following the command of the thearch Zhuanxu, he curled up and used his tail to beat out sounds on his stomach that were described as harmonious and rich. The Mount Min Range lies in modern Songpan, Sichuan, with its summit in nearby Mao District. Though considered here to be the origin of the Long River, modern geographers locate a northern origin in the Qumalai River in Qinghai province and a southern origin in the Muluwusu and the Wulanmulun Rivers in Tibet. Guo noted that the Kui-Ox existed in Shu (modern eastern Sichuan) in his time and weighed several thousand jin. In 318 c.e., one was said to have been killed in Shangyong Commandery in modern Hubei, yielding thirty-eight dan (approx. 507 lbs.) of meat.

It was several tens of feet long and used its forked tail to grab hold of people, oxen, and horses along river banks, and it then devoured them. The Chuo-Hare was recorded slightly earlier in the Guideways and described by Guo Pu as being like a rabbit but with deer’s feet and green in color. The ZhiFish remains unidentified. The You-Tree was described by Guo as a hardwood tree used for chariots; however, Hao Yixing noted that in the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs its wood is considered flexible and used for the edges of wheels.325

If seen, there will be war in the state.326 According to another version of the text, the Si-Wolf is an omen of chaos in the state. The wood of the XunTree is said to be good for making staves. The Yuzhang has been variously identified. Guo Pu thought it was large like the Qiu-Tree, a kind of catalpa, while others have stated that it is the camphor. The Excellent-Glory reaches a height of more than ten feet and flowers as soon as it grows. With red leaves and red flowers but no fruit, it can prevent fear of thunder if worn against the skin.327

Their gods all have horses’ bodies but with dragon heads. The proper animal sacrifice to them is a rooster that is buried, while the grain o ering employs glutinous rice. Mounts Min, Goumi, Wind-and-Rain, and Black-Horse are all Sacred Summits. The proper sacrifice to them is a wine o ering and a Lesser Corral. For the jade o ering, auspicious jade is used. Bear Mountain is a mountain of the Supreme God Di. The proper sacrifice is a wine o ering and a Grand Corral. For the jade o ering, a disc is employed. An exorcism dance with weapons and shields is performed. A prayer is o ered up with a dance in formal caps and gowns holding pieces of fine jade.330

203. T I P T O E - B I R D ( Q I Z H O N G ) ◊Ê One hundred forty li from the beginning of the tenth guideway through the Central Mountains stands Mount Fuzhou. Among its trees are many sandalwood. On its southern slope is much yellow gold. There is a bird here whose form resembles an owl but with one foot and a pig’s tail. It is called the Qizhong. If it is seen, there will be a great epidemic throughout the state.331
The Tiptoe-Bird’s name may suggest the di‹culty it must have in walking on one foot, although Hao Yixing thought it might have derived from the Land of the Tiptoe People [no. 249] mentioned in chapter 8, “Northern Lands beyond the Sea.” These people, however, have two feet. Guo Pu noted that they walk only on their toes. There is also a Tiptoe Mountain recorded in chapter 4, along the third guideway through the Eastern Mountains [see no. 156], where giant snakes live.332
204. P L O W E R ( G E N G F U ) — ̃ Nine hundred li from the beginning of the eleventh guideway through the Central Mountains stands Abundance Mountain. There is a beast here that resembles a gibbon with red eyes, a red mouth, and a yellow body. It is called Harmony-and-Peace (Yonghe), and if seen, there will be a great panic in the state. The god Plower dwells here. He often roams in the depths of the Pure-and-Clear Gorge

emitting a brilliant light whenever he emerges and returns. If seen, it is an omen that the state will be destroyed. There are nine bells here that sound whenever there is frost. On the heights of Abundance Mountain is much metal, and at its feet are many mulberry, Zuo-Oak, Niu-Trees, and Jiang-Oak.333 This illustration seems to combine Harmony-and-Peace with the god Plower by giving an ape a halo. Harmony-and-Peace seems an inappropriate name for the beast considering its malevolent e ect. Plower appears to be similar to other gods who roam in the depths of rivers such as EncirclingAlligator [no. 193] and Jimeng [no. 195], who are said to emit a brilliant light. Guo Pu identified this Pure-and-Clear Gorge with a similarly named river in Xihaojiao District in modern Henan and noted that when the god came down from the mountain into the river, the water turned red and emitted a brilliant light. He also stated that in his time there was a shrine here. Plower was also said to cause droughts.334
205. Z H E N - B I R D ( Z H E N ) } Nine hundred twenty li farther northeast stands Yaobi-Stone Mountain. Among its trees are many catalpa and plum. On its northern slope is much green cinnabar, and on its southern slope is much white-metal. There is a bird here whose form resembles a pheasant. It often eats Fei-Bugs and is called the Zhen.335 This Zhen-Bird di ers from no. 194. The Fei-Bug was recorded in Zuo’s Narratives as having caused disasters in the state of Lu in 722 and 665 b.c.e. It is an oval insect as light as a mosquito that eats the flowering parts of rice plants and stunts their growth, causing famine. It is also said to be malodorous, as Guo Pu noted. The Fei-Bug di ers from the Fei [no. 166], although both names are written with the same graph.336
206. B A B Y - L A D L E B I R D ( Y I N G S H A O ) ¶c Forty li farther east stands Mount Zhili. The Relief River emanates from here and flows southward into the Han River. There is a bird here named the Yingshao. Its form resembles a magpie with red eyes, a red beak, and a white body. Its tail is like a ladle, and it makes a sound like its name. There are many Yaks and Xian-Antelope here.337 Guo Pu noted that the tail was shaped like a wine ladle.338
207. G R E E N P L O W E R - B I R D ( Q I N G G E N G ) C— One hundred fifty li farther northeast and then northwest stands Mount Jinli. On its heights are many pines and cypress and many beautiful catalpa trees. On its northern slope are much green cinnabar and much metal. Among the beasts here are many leopards and tigers. There is a bird here whose form resembles a magpie with a blue body, a white mouth, white eyes, and a white tail. It is called the Qinggeng. It can protect against epidemics, and it makes a sound like its name.339
208. L I N Y Thirty li southeast stands Mount Yiku. On its heights are many NiuTrees and Jiang-Oak, as well as many Ju-Trees. There is a beast here whose form resembles a dog with tiger’s claws and scales named the Lin. It is adept at jumping about. Eating it can protect against the e ects of wind.340 The Ju-Tree remains unidentified. The reference to wind here probably reflects the belief in Chinese medicine that attributes a variety of maladies to the e ects of this natural phenomenon such as fever, insanity, paralysis, apoplexy, and so on.341

The Follow River flows downward from above, becoming subterranean at its feet. In it dwell many Three-Legged Turtles. The ThreeLegged Turtle has a split tail, and eating it cures insect-poisoning and epidemic illnesses.342 Here, too, Guo Pu noted that according to Approaching Refinement, these turtles are called Ben [see no. 188].343

If seen, a fire will break out in the town. It is called the Yiji.347 The Desert-Dog was said by Hao Yixing to have originated in the deserts extending from the west of China through Central Asia, and he described the dogs of his time from this area as tall, large, fierce, and powerful with thick hair.348
213. Y U E R _‡ Four hundred fifty li southeast of the beginning of the twelfth guideway through the Central Mountains stands Grandee Mountain. On its heights is much yellow gold, and at its feet is much green realgar. Among its trees are many mulberry, and among its plants are many bamboo and Chicken-Grain. The god Yuer dwells here. His form resembles a human, but he grasps two snakes. He often roams in the depths of the Long River and emits a brilliant light whenever he emerges and returns.349 The motif of grasping two snakes is associated with a number of powerful strange creatures recorded in later chapters. These include other gods, heroes, and wu-shamans, suggesting a higher degree of divine power over these much-feared reptiles that not only were regarded as a danger to the living but were also harmful to the bodies of the dead after burial. This mountain is one of four Sacred Summits along this guideway, and the sacrifice to Yuer involves a prayer o ered up with wine as well as displaying and burying a Lesser Corral and auspicious jade. This god Yuer di ers from no. 1.350

On its heights is much yellow gold, and below are much silver and iron. Among its trees are many hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo. Among its plants are many JianOrchids, Miwu-Lovage, peonies, and Qiongqiong-Selenium. The Two Daughters of the Supreme God Di dwell here. They often roam in the depths of the Long River. They generate the winds of the Li and Yuan Rivers, and they meet in the depths of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. This is in the area of the Nine Rivers. There are always violent winds and storms when they emerge and return. Here there are many strange gods who resemble humans but wear snakes on their heads and grasp snakes in their left and right hands. There are also many strange birds.351 Grotto Mountain is located in modern Yueyang, Hunan. A number of myths were elaborated over the centuries regarding goddesses of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, which flow through the ancient state of Chu. In addition to this passage in the Guideways, which identifies the two goddesses as daughters of Di, other versions have been preserved in two of “The Nine Songs” (Jiuge) cycle in the Songs

of Chu titled “The Queens of the Xiang River” (Xiangjun) and “The Lady of the Xiang River” (Xiang furen). In each, the performer, whose role may derive from a wu-shaman, expresses his desire for a single goddess of the river identified as a daughter of Di. In later elaborations, the two goddesses were said to be the thearch Yao’s (trad. r. c. 2145–2046 b.c.e.) daughters, who were married to his successor, the thearch Shun, and who followed the latter on his inspection tour of the south. When Shun died en route, they drowned themselves in sorrow in the Xiang River. They are sometimes given the names Ehuang and Nüying, with the former said to be the principal wife and the latter a concubine. Their ability to provoke unpredictable weather was later incorporated into a legend critical of the First Emperor of Qin, who was bu etted by violent winds when he visited Mount Xiang nearby. Upon inquiring about the cause, he was told by scholars that the source was the two goddesses known as the Queens of the Xiang River. Later folklore recorded in the Ming dynasty indicates that their tears were believed to have stained a kind of speckled bamboo that was named after them. The plants mentioned in this passage have been variously identified but were

all thought by Hao Yixing to be fragrant and hence appropriate to a place inhabited by beautiful goddesses. However, the tragic and malevolent atmosphere is also represented by the weather, the snake-holding gods, and the strange birds.352
This plate concludes the illustrations of the strange creatures in the first part of the Guideways, chapters 1 to 5, later known as the Guideways through Mountains. At some point, the following statement was appended to the text culled from late Zhou sources, though it is attributed to Yu the Great:
Yu said: “I have traveled through 5,370 of the famous mountains in the world over a route of 64,056 li. These words speak of the Five Mountain-Treasuries. The other, lesser mountains, being numerous, are not worth recording. From east to west, the world extends for 28,000 li, while from north to south, it extends for 26,000 li. There are eight thousand li of mountains that are the source of rivers and eight thousand li of mountains that receive the flow of rivers. Four hundred sixty-seven mountains produce copper, while 3,690 mountains produce iron. These are the areas of heaven and earth, where trees and grains are found, which yields halberds and spears and provides knives and daggers. Of these things, the able obtain more, while the incompetent remain poor. Thus, the Feng sacrifice to the Supreme Mountain and the Shan sacrifice to Mount Liangfu were carried out by seventy-two ruling houses. The measurements of the earth’s bounty that lie behind success or failure can be found here and can be used to the benefit of the state.”353

T H E P E O P L E W I T H P R O T R U D I N G C H E S T S ( J I E X I O N G M I N ) ≤I¡ Beyond the seas proceeding from the southwest corner to the southeast corner, there is the Land of the People with Protruding Chests in the southwest. The people have chests that protrude.354 This plate begins the second half of the Guideways, chapters 6–18, which is composed of groups of chapters later collectively called the Guideways through Seas. A preface later added at the beginning of the first of these chapters, “Guideway through Southern Lands beyond the Sea,” states: “Earth lies within the Six Coordinates [i.e., the four directions plus above and below] and is bounded by the Four Seas. It is illuminated by the sun and moon, crisscrossed by the stars and constellations, organized according to the four seasons, and perennially regulated by the Year-Star [i.e., Jupiter]. Of the things and forms that arise from spiritual forces, some are short-lived and some enjoy longevity. Only a sage can comprehend their Ways.” The People with Protruding Chests have chests that bulge like goiters. To the southeast of this land is Southern Mountain, where insects are perversely called “snakes” and snakes are called “fish.” Guo Pu ridiculed the people of South Mountain in his encomium and cited this name swapping as proof of the Daoist philosophical view that names are bestowed by people and are not determined by the objects themselves, leading to a confused understanding of reality. To the east are the Shared-Wings Birds

[Biyiniao; see nos. 54, 230], which are green and red in color and must fly in pairs, because they have only one wing each.355
216. T H E F E A T H E R E D P E O P L E ( Y U M I N ) –¡ The Land of the Feathered People lies farther east of the Wing-Sharing Birds. The people have long heads, and feathers grow on their bodies. In another version, they are said to be located southeast of the Wing-Sharing Birds and have long cheeks.356 Guo Pu noted that in the Explanations of Divinations in the Storehouse of All Things (Guizang qishi, 2nd cent. c.e.), they were said to have bird beaks, red eyes, and white heads. As early as the Warring States period in such poems as “The Far-O Journey” (Yuanyou) in the Songs of Chu anthology, a class of Transcendents known as Feathered Men were mentioned. In surviving images from the Eastern Han, they were depicted as feathered, winged people flying among the clouds, and these figures were subsequently incorporated into Daoist religious mythology. Guo Pu noted that in the illustrations of his time, the Feathered People of the Guideways were portrayed like these Transcendents, indicating that the two types had become confused. However, the Feathered People in the Guideways are

a foreign tribe without any attribute of longevity and are unrelated to these later forms of spiritual cultivation. Further along this route are the Sixteen Gods. They form two groups of eight, have small cheeks and red shoulders, and link hands and control the night for the Supreme God. To the east of them and west of the Blue River is a BifangBird [no. 69]. It is described here as having a human face and a single leg, though some commentators believe that “human face” is a textual error.357
217. T H E H U A N T O U P E O P L E ( H U A N T O U M I N ) NY¡ The Land of Huantou is located south of the Bifang-Bird. The people have human faces, wings, and bird beaks. They are shown in the act of fishing. Another version states that they are located east of the Bifang-Bird and that the place is called the Land of Huanzhu.358
Guo Pu commented that in his time, these people were illustrated as Transcendents, probably similar to the Feathered People [no. 216]. This land and their ancestor [see nos. 313, 335], who is also known by the variant names Huandou and Huanzhu [see no. 218], are recorded in more detail in chapter 15. This is one of the places in the text stating that the strange creature is in the process of performing some action, in this instance, “in the act of fishing.” Such passages are believed to refer to the early illustrations.359
218. T H E F I R E - G L U T T O N S ( Y A N H U O M I N ) Ωı¡ The Land of the Fire-Gluttons lies south of the Land of Huantou. The inhabitants have the bodies of beasts and are black. Fire is emitted from their mouths. According to another version, they are located east of Huanzhu.360 According to Guo Pu, they were depicted in his time as black monkeys, and the portrait in the Wu Renchen edition followed this description. However, another tradition of inauspicious, fire-emitting animals in the south that circulated in the Ming describes dogs known as Huodou, and this may have been the basis for representing the Fire-Gluttons here as dogs. Further to the northeast is the Land of the Three-Sprouts People [see no. 71], descendants of those who rose in revolt with Huantou [nos. 217, 313].361
219. T H E Z H I P E O P L E ( Z H I M I N ) T¡ The Land of the Zhi People is located farther east of the Land of the Three-Sprouts People. The people are yellow and shoot at snakes with bows and arrows. Another version states that the Land of the Zhi People lies farther east of the Land of the Three-Hairs People.362 In chapter 15, the Zhi People are described as descended from Without-Excess (Wuyin), a son of the thearch Shun, who came down from heaven to this place. There they are known as Shaman Zhi’s People and are surnamed Pan. Inhabiting an earthly paradise, they wear clothes without having to weave the cloth and eat grains without having to farm. Auspicious LuanBirds [no. 49] spontaneously sing forth, while Feng-Birds [nos. 271, 330] dance about. All kinds of animals harmoniously dwell here in flocks, and all kinds of grains grow in abundance.363

The people have holes in their chests.364 Guo Pu and Hao Yixing noted that the People with Perforated Chests were mentioned in
PLATE XLI 163



The Bamboo Annals (Zhushu jinian, c. 299 b.c.e.) and the Master Shi. In the former, a quasi-historical chronicle from the states of Jin and Wei, they and the Long-Thighs People [no. 240] were both recorded as paying a visit of submission to the court of the Yellow Thearch in the fifty-ninth year of his reign. A Yuan dynasty work, Record of Strange Regions (Yiyuzhi), states that in their society, superiors are carried about by inferiors by means of a bamboo pole inserted through the holes in their chests. This may have been the basis for such a depiction in the Wu Renchen edition.365

The people have crossed shins.366 In traditional Chinese ethnography, this characteristic was associated with the Vietnamese, whose land as early as the Warring States period was literally called Crossed-Feet (Jiaozhi). Several modern scholars have hypothesized that such strange features were understood in antiquity more symbolically. Later, many readers from the Han dynasty on may have misunderstood this earlier mentality and interpreted such references in a literal and fantastic manner. This tendency could be seen in these illustrations, which naturalistically represent features that appear bizarre. Even when later contact clearly provided evidence to discredit such names, they continued to be used, as in the case of the Vietnamese.367
222. T H E N E V E R - D Y I N G P E O P L E ( B U S I M I N ) £∫¡ The NeverDying People dwell farther east of the Land of the People with Crossed Shins. They are black and enjoy longevity, never dying. According to another version, they dwell farther east of the Land of the People with Perforated Chests.368 These people are mentioned again in chapter 15 as bearing the surname Ah and are said to eat of the Sweet-Tree. The illustration here is apparently based on this latter description. The idea of a land of people who never die can also be found in the poem “The Far-O Journey” in the Songs of Chu as well as in The Compendium of Mr. Lü, in which Yu the Great is said to have visited such a place. The Guideways treats them as a foreign tribe that is inherently long-lived. However, Guo Pu and other readers of his time such as Tao Qian mistakenly associated the Never-Dying People with the Feathered People [no. 216] of the Daoist cult of Transcendents who achieved their longevity through esoteric techniques of alchemical and spiritual cultivation. Guo commented that on Round-Hill Mountain is the Never-Dying Tree, which confers long life if eaten, as well as the Red Spring, which has a similar benefit if its waters are drunk. Furthermore, he identified this Never-Dying Tree with the Sweet-Tree.369
223. T H E P E O P L E W I T H F O R K E D T O N G U E S ( Q I S H E M I N ) ¡fi¡ The Land of the People with Forked Tongues lies farther east of the Never-Dying People.370 Though Guo Pu believed that these people’s tongues were forked, Hao Yixing argued that the graph qi (“forked”) was interchangeable with fan (“reversed”). Thus, these may be a people whose tongues are reversed. He cited The
164 PLATES XLI–XLII



Compendium of Mr. Lü, which characterized the speech of surrounding barbarian tribes as “reversed tongues” ( fanshe). This land is also called Reversed Tongues in the Master of Huainan, where it is listed as one of thirty-six foreign lands, most of which are recorded in the Guideways. Commenting on both these texts, Gao You (c. 168212 c.e.) described the Land of the People with Reversed Tongues in the south as a place whose people have tongues that are attached to the front of their mouths and that move in their throats. Their language was incomprehensible to outsiders. This characteristic probably reflects the eternal di‹culty in China of outsiders trying to understand the many local dialects and non-Chinese languages in the south.371

of Thearch Jun, used his bow and arrow to kill Chiseled-Teeth (Zuochi), a man with fangs five or six feet long who had terrorized the people. Though the Tricephalous People have three heads, Guo Pu in his encomium was not overly impressed with this arrangement:
Although it is said they breathe as one, They use di erent paths for respiration. When one looks, three can see; One eats, all experience satiation. In form, they may seem well-rounded. Still, something was lacking in their creation.373
225. T H E Z H O U R A O P E O P L E ( Z H O U R A O M I N ) P«¡ The Land of the Zhourao People lies farther east of the Land of the Tricephalous People. The people are short and wear caps and sashes.374 The Zhourao are one of several foreign peoples of diminutive stature in the Guideways. That they wear Chinese caps and sashes indicates that they are regarded as comparatively civilized. Guo Pu commented that they were only three feet tall, lived in caves, were able to manufacture clever mechanisms, and, like Chinese, ate the five major types of grains. In another version of this passage and in chapter 15, they are called the Jiaoyao and surnamed Ji. There they are said to consume only fine grain. A number of early texts mention them as the smallest people, sometimes no taller than seven inches. In The Bamboo Annals, the Jiaoyao are recorded as visiting the thearch Yao in the twenty-ninth year of his reign as a tributary people. They presented a device called “Underwater-Wings” as an example of their technical skills. These were probably used for underwater swimming, for this people was also said to be skilled at diving.375
226. T H E L O N G - A R M S P E O P L E ( C H A N G B I M I N )  ̄u¡ The Land of the Long-Arms People lies farther east of the Land of the Zhourao People. They catch fish in the water by grabbing hold of a fish with each hand.376 Such tribes were also recorded in early sources as dwelling in the south or west, their arms said to span some twenty or thirty feet. Guo Pu cited a reference to these people later preserved in the “Treatise on the Eastern Yi-Barbarians” in the o‹cial History of the Wei Dynasty (Weishu, 554 c.e.):
During the Huangchu era (220–226) of the Wei dynasty, Wang Qi (n.d.), the governor of Xuantu [Korean: Hyönt’o, in modern North Korea-Liaoning-southern Jilin], defeated King Shanshang [Sansang, r. 196–227] of Gaojuli [Koguryö, in modern Korea]. He pursued him past the Land of the Woju Tribe [Ökcho kuk, in modern northeast Korea], whose eastern boundary bordered the sea close to where the sun rises. Wang asked the elders here if there were any people beyond the sea to the east. They replied that a cloth robe was once recovered from the sea. It resembled Chinese clothing, except that the sleeves were thirty feet long—this must have belonged to one of the Long-Arms People.
Hao Yixing believed that the statement about their grasping fish in each hand referred to how they were depicted in the early illustrations.377

He rides on two dragons.378 The god Zhurong is located here at the very end of chapter 6, “Southern Lands Beyond the Sea.” Varying myths about Zhurong are recorded in other entries in the Guideways. In chapter 16, he is the grandson of the thearch Zhuanxu and father of Crown Prince Long-Zither, who is credited with creating musical compositions. Because chapter 18 considers Zhuanxu to be a great-grandson of the Yellow Thearch, Yuan Ke stated that he should be included in the latter’s lineage. Alternatively, in chapter 18, he is said to have been born at the Long River, a fourth-generation descendant of the Flame Thearch and father of Gonggong, who unleashed the Deluge. However, the same chapter also records Zhurong as a god of punishments. He is the one who carried out the orders of the Supreme God Di to execute Gun at the sacred altar on Feather Mountain after Gun stole the Expanding Soil to curb the Deluge [see no. 345]. Guo Pu commented here in chapter 6 that he is the god of fire and in chapter 16 further elaborated that he served under the thearch Gaoxin (also

known as Thearch Ku [Diku], trad. r. c. 3rd millennium b.c.e.). This reflects his later identity, which more fully emerged by the Western Han and was elaborated in religious Daoism. In pantheons organized according to Five Agents cosmology, he is often portrayed as an assistant of the Flame Thearch associated with the south and with summer. Eventually, Zhurong was located at Transverse Mountain (modern Nanyue, Hunan), the Southern Marchmount, whose highest peak is named after him. This illustration depicts him with one of his divine subordinates who is bearing fire.379

sion, this occurred on the Plain of the Great Bestowal.380 The Xia Sovereign Qi (trad. r. c. 1978–1965 b.c.e.) is recorded here at the beginning of chapter 7, “Guideway through the Western Lands beyond the Sea,” which extends from the southwest corner to the northwest corner of this area. His name, Qi, means “to open up,” and he was miraculously born of the union of Yu the Great and a girl of Muddy Mountain, who later metamorphosed into a stone out of fright when Yu transformed himself into a bear. Yu demanded his son, and Qi was born from the stone’s north side when it opened up. The second sovereign of the Xia dynasty, he is regarded in some myths as a culture hero who brought divine music and dance to humankind or as a trickster figure who stole the music from heaven. A variant myth is recorded in chapter 16, where he is referred to by a later name, Kai [see no. 325], a Han dynasty usage to avoid the taboo personal name of Liu Qi, Emperor Jing of the Western Han (r. 156–141 b.c.e.). However, other traditions regarded him less favorably. The utilitarian philosopher Mo Di (c. 479381 b.c.e.), who opposed ceremonial music, described him as a decadent ruler who indulged himself in entertainment and lost heaven’s favor. In the “Questions of Heaven” in the Songs of Chu, he supplanted his father’s choice for a successor and provoked a rebellion in addition to having caused the death and dismemberment of his mother through his miraculous birth.381

Surnamed Yao, they eat millet and command four kinds of birds. Guo Pu and other commentators, however, noted that the surname Yao indicates that they were descended from the thearch Shun rather than Jun, while Ehuang is usually considered the wife of Shun.383

There is a yellow horse here with tiger’s stripes, one eye, and one foreleg.384 Guo Pu considered the One-Arm People as similar, if not identical, to the Shared-Shoulder People mentioned in Approaching Refinement, which recorded the latter as parallel to other single-featured anomalies dwelling in the four directions such as the Shared-Eyes Fish (east), the Shared-Wings Birds [see nos. 54, 215, south], and the Shared-Shoulder Beasts (west). Guo regarded all these as basically possessing only half a body.385

He also identified the horses as the type known as Lucky

Measure [no. 279] recorded in chapter 12 as being striped with a white body, red hair, and eyes like gold and as adding one thousand years to one’s life if eaten. A well-known collection of anomaly accounts, A Record of Manifold Curiosities (Bowuzhi, late 3rd cent. c.e.), stated:
The Single-Arm People are adept at creating mechanical things, which they use in hunting. They can manufacture flying carriages which travel far on the wind. During the time of King Tang [of the Shang], a western wind came and blew them in their carriages to Yu Province [modern Henan]. Tang destroyed their carriages so that the common people would not see them. Ten years later, an eastern wind started to blow. The Single-Arm People rebuilt their carriages and were sent home in them, for their land lay forty thousand li beyond the Jade Gate [modern Yumenguan, Gansu].
This myth seems to reflect the importance of chariot technology, which along with horses was of decisive military advantage from the earliest periods of Chinese history

onward. Many technical innovations originated among the peoples of Central Asia, which Chinese rulers sought to obtain and these, perhaps, were symbolized by the image of a “flying carriage.” This may also record a mass migration of people from the west who were ultimately expelled.387

233. X I N G T I A N Œ— Xingtian and the Supreme God Di came to this place and struggled against each other for ultimate power. The Supreme God cut o Xingtian’s head and buried him at Eternally Auspicious Mountain. Xiangtian’s nipples then transformed into eyes, and his navel became a mouth. He performs a dance with an ax and shield.389 Based on Yuan Ke’s reconstruction, Xingtian was originally an o‹cial of the Flame Thearch and continued the latter’s losing struggle against the Yellow Thearch for the position of Supreme God. He is thus similar to several other figures such as Chiyou and Kuafu the Boaster [no. 247]. After being defeated and decapitated by the Yellow Thearch, Xingtian was buried at Eternally Auspicious Mountain, the birthplace of the Flame Thearch. However, he managed to regenerate himself and continue his defiance, as expressed by his martial dance. The Master of Huainan considered him a corpse, for he resembles other strange creatures in the Guideways such as the Corpse of Geng of the Xia [no. 323], who was likewise defeated and decapitated but survived. Xingtian’s defiant spirit was celebrated by both Guo Pu in an encomium and by the poet Tao Qian. Tao, in the tenth of his “Thirteen Poems upon Reading the Guideways through Mountains and Seas,” saw a parallel between Xingtian’s and Spirit-Guardian’s [no. 133] persistance in overcoming the tragedies of their pasts but questioned their obsessiveness and implied a contrast with the unrealized political ambitions of his youth.390

They wear proper robes and caps and carry swords.391 The Wei-Birds were recorded as omens of the destruction of the state wherever they fly. The dress of these men indicates that they were regarded as comparatively civilized. Guo Pu probably combined several accounts when he noted that a Wang Meng (trad. c. 1440 b.c.e.) was sent by King Taimou of the Shang (trad. r. c. 1474–1400 b.c.e.) to search for medicinal herbs and followed the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275] to this place, where he ran out of food and could go no farther. Wang survived by eating the fruit of trees and wearing clothes of bark. Though he never married, he gave birth to two sons who sprang forth from his body, whereupon he died. These were the ancestors of the inhabitants of the Land of Men. In a more historicized version, Wang Meng was recorded in The Bamboo Annals as an o‹cial of King Taimou, who was dispatched in the twenty-sixth year of his reign to greet the Western Rong tribe when they came to pay a visit of submission. However, no mention is made there of the Queen Mother of the West or of this land. Two other accounts later preserved in the Imperial Encyclopedia of the Taiping Era (Taiping yulan, 983) stated that the Land of Men lies twenty-thousand li beyond

235. B I N G F E N G }? The Bingfeng dwells east of the Land of Shaman Xian. Its form resembles a pig but with a head both in front and in back. Its color is black.393 Shaman Xian (Wu Xian) is a divine shaman recorded in a number of early texts. He is variously said to have lived during the times of the Divine Farmer (Shennong), the Yellow Thearch, and King Taimou of the Shang. In chapter 16, he is one of ten wu-shamans who climb Shaman Mountain to collect herbs. Here he is described as grasping a green snake in his right hand and a red snake in his left. Also active in this land of his descendants are many wu-shamans who climb Mount Dengbao, probably also in search of medicinal herbs. Guo Pu considered the Bingfeng as part of a class of two-headed creatures that included two-headed snakes and humorously suggested in his encomium that this characteristic made them particularly obstinate. The modern writer and scholar Wen Yiduo (1899–1946), however, regarded the two-headedness of such creatures as symbolizing

hermaphroditism. Chapter 16 mentions a similar creature known as the Pingpeng though its two heads are on the right and left instead of in the front and back.394
236. W O M E N ( N Ü Z I ) kl The Land of Women lies north of the Land of Shaman Xian. Two women dwell here in the water, which surrounds them. According to another version, they dwell together in a house.395 These two women are the sole inhabitants of the Land of Women, and in this the place parallels the Land of Men [no. 234]. Guo Pu recorded a myth about a Yellow Lake, where the women bathe and then emerge pregnant. Any sons they give birth to suddenly die after three years. Among other later accounts, the “Treatise on the Eastern Yi-Barbarians” in the History of the Wei Dynasty states that there is a land in the sea beyond the Land of Woju [see no. 226] in the northeast inhabited only by women, while Hao Yixing quoted a similar treatise in the History of the Latter [Eastern] Han Dynasty (Houhanshu, mid-5th cent.) that notes that the women become pregnant by gazing into a divine well. The Land of Women is also mentioned in chapter 16 but without any further description.396

It is located north of the Land of Women. The people have human faces and snake bodies. Their tails twist above their heads.397 Xuanyuan is the personal name of the Yellow Thearch. Extremity Mountain lies just to the north and is a place where people fear to shoot arrows westward for fear of disturbing the thearch’s spirit at Xuanyuan’s Mountain, a square-shaped formation protected on all sides by four snakes. This mountain is also mentioned in chapter 3 as standing 480 li west of Jade Mountain, where the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275] lives. Guo Pu regarded it as a dwelling place of the Yellow Thearch as well as the location where he took a wife. Yuan Ke noted that the appearance of these people is characteristic of gods and suggested that they may reflect the form of the Yellow Thearch himself.398
238. Y E L L O W - S T E E D ( C H E N G H U A N G ) o¿ The Land of the White People is located north of the Dragon-Fish. The people have white bodies and wear their hair long. Yellow-Steed dwells here. Its form resembles a fox and it has horns on its back. Anyone who rides it can live for two thousand years.399 The Dragon-Fish lives on a hill north of the Plain of Plenty and resembles a carp. According to another version, it resembles a crustacean. Also known as the Tortoise-Fish, it was said to have been ridden by a god as he traveled through the nine regions of the world. These White People are also mentioned in chapter 16, while another White People are recorded in chapter 14. The latter, however, dwell in the east, are descended from Thearch Jun, surnamed Xiao, eat grains, and command four kinds of birds as well as tigers, leopards, and bears. Wearing long, untied hair is a characteristic feature of shamans and other powerful figures such as corpses, while people with white skin were regarded in some other early texts such as the Master Zhuang as extremely pure and spiritual. Yellow-Steed was considered by some commentators to be identical with other auspicious yellow horses bearing similar names like Flying-Yellow (Feihuang) and Zihuang. Flying-Yellow was an omen of benevolent rule. Zihuang/Yellow-Steed was described as a horse with dragon

wings that the Yellow Thearch rode when he left the human world and became a Transcendent. Yet another marvelous yellow horse of antiquity was ridden by Boyao, God of the Yellow River, as he led the way for King Mu of the Zhou (r. 956–918 b.c.e) on his ritual tour of the west in The Chronicle of King Mu.400

According to Guo Pu, the Sushen People originally went about naked, but later when ancient thearchs ruled in China, clothes were made from the bark of the tree. The illustration shows the figure wearing such an outfit. Other sources indicate that some Central Asian peoples made clothing from leaves that were as fine as silk. According to The Bamboo Annals, the Sushen People visited the court of King Cheng of the Zhou in the ninth year of his reign (c. 1034 b.c.e.).402

In another version, they are called the Long-Feet People.403 Guo Pu regarded the Brave-and-Constant Tree as providing bark used by the Supreme God Di to clothe humankind in remote antiquity. Concerning the Long-Thighs People, he commented that their legs are thirty feet in length and cited another account that they bear the Long-Arms People [no. 226] on their backs to fish. Perhaps that is why the illustrator chose to show one of them fishing with his hands. Their land is located east of the Red River. According to The Bamboo Annals, they came to the Chinese court to pay tribute to the Yellow Thearch in the fifty-ninth year of his reign, accompanied by the People with Perforated Chests [no. 220]. Chapter 16 also records the Long-Shins People [no. 316] as dwelling beyond the Northwest Sea and east of the Red River.404
241. R U S H O U Ω ̈ In the West, Rushou wears a snake through his left ear and rides on two dragons.405 The god Rushou [no. 74] was also recorded in chapter 2 as dwelling on Mount You overlooking the place where the sun sets in the west. Here he is located at the very end of the “Guideway through the Western Lands beyond the Seas” and thus parallels the other gods located at the Four Extremities [see nos. 227, 253, 260]. Rushou was recorded in the following anecdote from the Conversations from the Feudal States (Guoyu, 4th cent. b.c.e.) in which Chou, Duke of Guo, is forewarned that he will lose his state, which, in fact, occurred six years later, in 655 b.c.e.:
The Duke of Guo dreamed while in his ancestral temple that he saw a god with a human face, white hair, and tiger’s claws who was grasping hold of a yue-ax and standing under the western eave. The duke was afraid and started to run away, but the god said, “Do not go! The Supreme God Di has decreed that the army of Jin
174 PLATES XLVI–XLVII



will secretly attack your gate.” The duke bowed his head in submission and upon awakening ordered his grand historian, Xiao, to divine the meaning of the dream. Xiao replied, “According to what Your Excellency has said, this was Rushou who is the god of punishments. When heaven decides a matter, the proper god in charge appears.”
Another description of Rushou may have been preserved in the poem “The Great Summons” in the Songs of Chu (Chuci: Dazhao) as having the head of a pig, slanting eyes, disheveled hair, long claws, and serrated teeth and being given to wild laughter. In other early sources, he is described as the god of metal, one of the Five Agents, as ruler over the autumn season, the west, and as an o‹cial or descendant of the thearch Lesser-Brilliance. He often carries the yue-ax of execution. Based on this feature, he may have earlier been a god in the Shang royal religion who was paired in the Eastern Zhuo together with Goumang [no. 260] as parallel, fraternal dieties within Five Agents cosmology.406

The people who dwell here have one eye in the middle of their faces.407 These people are mentioned at the beginning of chapter 8, the “Guideway through the Northern Lands Beyond the Sea,” which extends from the northeastern corner to the northwestern corner of this area. At the foot of Bell Mountain is where the god Torch-Darkness [see no. 55] dwells. The OneEyed People are also mentioned in chapter 17, where they are surnamed Wei and are said to be descendants of the thearch Lesser-Brilliance who eat millet. They may be identical to the inhabitants of the Land of the Demon People mentioned in chapter 12. These people also have one eye and the pronunciation of their name, gui (“demon”), is close in sound to the surname Wei. Guo Pu in his encomium used the dominant feature of the One-Eyed People to reflect on the nature of vision:
Four eyes may not be too many; For these people, one is not too few. The musician Ziye, though blind, Required nothing for a clear view. Physically, he traveled far and wide But found only the infinitesimal to be of value.408

Their knees are reversed and their feet bend upward. According to another version, their land is called the Land of the Liuli People, and the people’s feet bend backward.409 A variation on this theme appears in chapter 17, where the Land of the Niuli People contains people who have no bones and who are said to be the children of the Pendant-Ears People, a variant of the People Who Hold Up Their Ears [no. 246].410
244. M I N I S T E R L I U ( X I A N G L I U ) ¤h An o‹cial of Gonggong [no. 314] is called Minister Liu. He has nine heads and consumes the sustenance provided by nine mountains. The tracks of his collisions with the landscape became lakes and streams. Yu the Great killed Minister Liu, and every place stained by his stinking blood could no longer grow the five varieties of grain. Yu excavated the land to a depth of three ren (twentyfour feet), but it still became soaked with blood three times. Thereupon, he constructed the Terrace of the Thearchs with the land. It stands north of Mount Kunlun and east of the Land of the Flexible People [no. 243]. Minister Liu has nine heads with human faces and a snake’s body, which is green. None here dare to shoot arrows northward for fear of Gonggong’s Terrace. The terrace is located to the east and is square. Each corner has a snake with tiger stripes whose face looks southward.411 In Chinese mythology, the god Gonggong unleashed the Deluge and struggled for supremacy against the Supreme God Di. The identity of his adversary varies, but in one version preserved in the Master of

Huainan he fought against Zhuanxu and created Cleft Mountain after colliding with it, a place recorded in chapter 2 as east of Mount Kunlun. This snapped the cord joining heaven and earth, causing Heaven to tilt toward the northwest and a gap to open up on earth in the southeast. In this version, however, it is Yu the Great who restores order by killing Gonggong’s o‹cial. Yuan Ke saw Gonggong in the line of resisters to the power of the Yellow Thearch and his lineage. His terrace is described as similar to Xuanyuan’s Mountain [see no. 237]. In chapter 17, Minister Liu is known as Minister You and similarly described with only slight variations. Hao Yixing noted the apparent contradiction in the location of Mount Kunlun. Here it is in a chapter of lands “beyond the sea” while in chapter 12, both it and the Terrace of the Thearchs are located “within the sea.”412

corrupt beginning at the point where it speaks of the people raising one arm. Based on Yuan Ke’s reconstruction, it should probably read, “The people have deep eyes and raise one arm. According to another version, they are located east of Gonggong’s Terrace.” Nevertheless, the illustrator has followed the printed text and depicted this deep-eyed person with only one eye. It is possible that these people were depicted raising one arm in the early illustrations. They are mentioned again in chapter 17, where they are said to be surnamed Fen and to eat fish. Guo Pu noted that they were a barbarian tribe with extremely deep-set eyes that obtained its surname during the time of the Yellow Thearch. Here the text suggests that they were earlier depicted eating fish. They are also mentioned in the Master Shi along with the People with Perforated Chests [no. 220] and the Long-Thighs People [no. 240] as tribes that came under the influence of the Yellow Thearch and that were thus comparatively civilized.414

The people command two striped tigers. They hold up their ears with their hands, and they dwell on an island in the middle of the sea and capture many strange things that go in and come out of the water. The two tigers are located to the east of these people.415 A similar people is mentioned in chapter 17, where they are called the Pendant-Ears People. They are surnamed Ren, eat grain, and are descended from Ape-Howl (Yuhao), god of the Eastern Sea and a son of the Yellow Thearch. A more fantastic description was later recorded in the Tang dynasty of the Big-Ears People, which may be a further variation. There it was said that when sleeping they used one ear as a mat and another as a blanket. For an interesting comparison with a strange creature recorded in the Wonders of the East dating from the European Middle Ages, see figure 4 (page 21).416

He became thirsty and wanted to drink, so he drank from the Yellow River and the Wei River. The water from the Yellow River and the Wei River was not su‹cient for him so he went north to drink from the Grand Lake. But before he reached it, he died of thirst on the road. He threw down his sta , which became transformed into the Deng Forest.417 Kuafu is a divine hero who vainly challenged superior power. He is also recorded in more detail in chapter 17. There his divinity is more apparent, for Kuafu is described as wearing two yellow snakes in his ears and as grasping two yellow snakes, which is how he is illustrated here. A grandson of the god Lord Earth (Houtu), who is symbolically correlated with the color yellow in Five Agents cosmology, Kuafu is located at the Capital City That Supports Heaven, a mountain in the Great Wilds to the North where he is said to have died. The text here states that he failed to estimate the limits of his strength when he chased the sun and reached Ape Valley where the sun sets. He sought to drink from the Yellow River and finding it insu‹cient, was proceeding toward the Grand Lake when he died. It then appends another myth of Kuafu stating that he was killed by Winged-Dragon [no. 305] after the
178 PLATES XLVIII–XLIX



latter had executed the rebel Chiyou. Thus, Kuafu was also regarded as a rebel against the Yellow Thearch. The symbolism of Five Agents cosmology is present in all these myths. Kuafu, representing “earth” (yellow; Lord Earth) is overcome by “water” (thirst; or WingedDragon) as he struggles against “fire,” or the dominant ruler of Earth (the sun; Yellow Thearch). Grand Lake is mentioned in chapters 11 and 17 as one hundred li in circumference located north of GeeseGate (Yanmen, modern Dai District, Shanxi), where flocks of birds hatch and molt. According to a later more widely known version of Kuafu in the Master Lie (Liezi, c. late 4th cent.), his sta became a forest by soaking up his decaying flesh. Thus, Kuafu was transformed into the phase “wood” and, as trees, remains dependent on the benevolence of the sun, earth, and water and can still be destroyed by fire. In his encomium, Guo Pu interpreted him philosophically as an example of cosmic mystery and saw Kuafu’s physical metamorphosis into the Deng Forest as a kind of triumphant compensation. The modern writer and early mythologist Shen Yanbing (1896–1981), however, regarded Kuafu as representing an ancient tribe of giants analagous to the Greek
PLATE XLIX 179
247



Titans, for his name has also been interpreted as simply meaning “giant.” In contemporary mainland China, Kuafu is one of several mythical figures along with SpiritGuardian [no. 133] and Old Fool (Yugong), also known from the Master Lie, who have been popularly promoted as heroes challenging nature and transformed by o‹cial propaganda into icons of the struggle for modernization. Kuafu has even been honored with a public statue.418

Yuan Ke argued that Bofu is actually Kuafu [no. 247], since both names can mean “giant” and that this is a land of Kuafu’s descendants who were also known as Bofu. Hao Yixing believed the two trees were giant ones that constituted the Deng Forest. They are represented to the upper right of the illustration.420

According to another version, they are called the Big-Heel People.421 According to Yuan Ke’s reconstruction, the Juying People are people who hold up their huge goiters with their hands. Based on Gao You’s commentary to the Master of Huainan, Guo Pu noted that the Tiptoe People walk on their tiptoes and that their heels never touch the ground. Later commentators argued that, based on a confusion of the graph qi (toe) with fan (to be reversed), these people are actually the Reversed-Heels People whose feet point backward and that, moreover, they are not giants. The illustrator, however, has clearly followed the existing text. A similarly named people whom Hao Yixing and Yuan Ke believed to be identical to these people, the Zhizhong, are recorded in The Bamboo Annals as visiting the court of the Xia-dynasty King Gui [i.e., Jie] in the sixth year of his reign (trad. 1583 b.c.e.).422
250. T A O T U μb Within the Northern Sea dwells a beast whose form resembles a horse. It is named Taotu.423 The location “within the Northern Sea” implies a land area, either continental or an island. Taotu is also recorded in Approaching Refinement, where the commentary quotes this passage of the Guideways with the additional phrase that he is green, thus leading Hao Yixing to believe that this was part of the original text. Taotu is also mentioned in the Recovered Documents of Zhou (Yizhoushu, 4th–1st cent. b.c.e.) as a breed of foreign horses presented to King Tang of the Shang.424

two other gods mentioned in early texts, Dark-Vastness (Xuanming) and Yujing, both of whom are said to be gods of the Northern Sea. In the Han, the genealogy of the former was traced back to LesserBrilliance, and he was said to be an o‹cial of Zhuanxu. Yujing is also mentioned in chapter 14 as the grandson of the Yellow Thearch and the son of Yuhao. Yuhao became the god of the Eastern Sea and Yujing, of the Northern Sea. The graph yu in both names also means “ape.” Etymological arguments have been made by Yuan Ke that the name Yujing suggests a whale and that this god’s body is that of a fish and not black. Ape-Strength is similarly recorded again in chapter 17 except that there he treads on two red snakes. He also appears in a later fable in the Master Lie about the five sacred mountain-islands of the Transcendents, which were in danger of drifting west. The Supreme God Di commanded Ape-Strength to use fifteen giant tortoises to support the islands on their heads in three shifts, each one lasting for sixty thousand years. ApeStrength may also be a wind god. The Master of Huainan records Ape-Strength as born of the Wind of Cleft Mountain [see no. 314], said to be a violent northwest gale that

Another in chapter 18 is located in the north, while a third mentioned in the Master of Huainan lies in the southeast. Here they are described as gigantic and as piloting boats. Shebi is also recorded again in chapter 14 [no. 302], where he is similarly described, with the additional feature of having dog’s ears instead of large ones, the graphs for “dog” (quan) and “large” (da) being easily confused. Hao Yixing identified Shebi with She-Dragon, who is mentioned in the Master Guan as having been banished by the Yellow Thearch to the east, where he became a local god.

The graph for hong is similar to another one with the identical pronunciation that means “rainbow.” Rainbows were thought to lack feet and tails. Their two heads may symbolize the conjunction of yin and yang energies, hence, they also functioned as poetic images of love. When appearing over households, rainbows were generally believed to be auspicious, although they could also be evil omens. In some myths, they were associated with divine women. Rainbows were classified into many varieties, and Yuan Ke suggested that the Honghong were specifically evening rainbows, while Mathieu hypothesized that being located in the north, they may be the aurora borealis.433
256. T I A N W U —d At Sunrise Valley is a god named Tianwu. He is known as Lord of the Waters and dwells north of the Honghong-Rainbows [no. 255] on land in between two rivers. Tianwu is a beast with eight heads with human faces, eight feet, and eight tails. His back is green and yellow.434 Tianwu is also described in chapter 14 but is said there to have eight heads with human faces, a tiger’s body, and ten tails.435

people of this land as relatively civilized, for they eat the five kinds of grains and wear silk. The Nine-Tail Fox is also recorded in chapter 14, where Guo noted that it was an auspicious omen that appeared in a time of peace. However, it is also described in chapter 1 at GreenHills Mountain as a man-eater who makes a sound like a baby and who can protect against insect-poison if eaten. Nine-Tail Foxes appear elsewhere in Chinese mythology. Yu the Great encountered a white one on Muddy Mountain and considered it an auspicious sign that he marry the girl of the mountain, Nüjiao. Later, in Han iconography, it was one of several animals often depicted with the Queen Mother of the West [nos. 65, 275]. Its nine tails were popularly regarded as representing many sons.437

ered their land to be an island in the sea. The Hairy People are also mentioned in chapter 17 as dwelling in the north, where they are said to be surnamed Yi and descended from Generous-Man (Chuoren) [see no. 327]. Generous-Man was killed by Tall-Breastplate (Xiujia), a great-grandson of Yu the Great. Yu then took pity on Generous-Man by secretly establishing the Hairy People in their own land. They are said to eat millet and to command four kinds of birds. According to their surname, the Hairy People are also among the descendants of the Yellow Thearch based on a genealogy of twelve clans recorded in the Conversations from the Feudal States. Guo Pu described them as living on an island in the sea some two thousand li southeast of Linhai Commandery (modern Linhai, Zhejiang). They are small in stature with hair all over their bodies like boars or bears and dwell naked in caves. He also recorded the following contemporary anecdote, which confirmed for him the information in the Guideways:
In the fourth year of the Yongjia era of the Jin dynasty (310), the Commandantin-chief of Salt Distribution for Wu Commandery, Dai Feng, took possession of a boat along shore that contained four men and women who resembled this description. They could not speak our language and were sent to the o‹ce of the counselor-in-chief [in Moling, modern Nanjing, Jiangsu], but only one survived the journey. His Excellency bestowed a wife upon him, and he produced sons, coming and going in the marketplace and gradually learning the language. He said he came from the Hairy People.
Hao Yixing also noted that he had personally seen such a Hairy Person in Beijing in February or March of 1806 and described him as having hair like a bear all over his face as well as his body. He resembled a monkey around the eyes but was otherwise a human. Though he did not understand Chinese, the owner was able to communicate with him by signifying his intentions. Mathieu and other modern commentators have suggested that the Hairy People may originally have been the Ainu people, who ranged from Siberia to Japan.439
259. T H E L A B O R I N G P E O P L E ( L A O M I N ) “¡ The Land of the Laboring People is located north of the Land of the Hairy People [no. 258]. The people are black. According to another version, they are called the Instructed People, and from their faces and eyes to their hands and feet, they are completely black.440 Guo Pu noted that the Laboring People eat fruits and vegetables and possess two-headed birds, illustrated here to the right. That they are also called the Instructed People may be due to the graphs for “labor” (lao) and “instruct” ( jiao) being roughly homophonous. Hao Yixing believed that this land was the same as the Land of Laborers, which he stated was located northeast of Fish-Skin Island, where the Fish-Skin Barbarians live. These places have not been identified, but Hao also stated that both these peoples were completely black from their faces and eyes to their hands and feet.441

PLATES LII–LIII 185



Agents cosmology, has a square head, and wears white. Located at the end of the eastern lands beyond the sea, Goumang may have originally been a local god worshiped along the eastern coast of China. In other early texts, he is an important god of the east who is sometimes paired with Rushou [nos. 74, 241] of the west as members of a divine bureaucracy. Both appear as messengers of the Supreme God Di bestowing punishments or rewards. The following anecdote in the Master Mo is similar to the one quoted earlier about Rushou from the Conversations from the Feudal States:
Once, Duke Mu of Qin [r. 659–621 b.c.e.] was carrying out a sacrifice in his ancestral temple at dawn when a god entered the gate and stood to the left. He had a bird’s body, wore white silk with trimmings, and had a dignified, squareshaped face. When Duke Mu saw him, he was fearful and tried to flee. The god said, “Have no fear! The Supreme God Di is pleased with your luminous virtue and has sent me to bestow upon you nineteen more years of life that you may
186 PLATE LIII
260



bring prosperity to your state and family, that your descendants may multiply, and that you may maintain the state of Qin.” Duke Mu bowed twice to the ground in submission and said, “May I dare to ask your name, Divine One?” “I am Goumang,” he replied.
In the historicized mythology of Zuo’s Narratives, however, Goumang is already organized into Five Agents cosmology as the god of wood, and the name designates a title in the divine bureaucracy rather than an individual god. Chong, as one of four uncles of the thearch Lesser-Brilliance, was appointed by Lesser-Brilliance as Goumang. The uncle Gai became Rushou (metal), and the uncles Xiu, along with Xi, became DarkVastness (water). Similarly, Li [see no. 319], who in the myth of the severing of the ladder between heaven and earth in the Conversations from the Feudal States was placed in charge of heaven, is here described as a son of the thearch Zhuanxu appointed to the position of Zhurong (fire) [no. 227], while Ju-Dragon, a son of Gonggong [no. 314], became Lord Earth (earth). In later periods, Goumang’s characteristics were further elaborated, and his cult, like that of Rushou, survived to influence both Han and Tang state cults as well as religious Daoism.443
This entry marks the end of chapter 9 and the group of four chapters on lands beyond the seas. Directly following it is a note by the Han court bibliographer Liu Xin dated 6 b.c.e. noting that he and other officials had completed their editing of the text for the imperial library. This suggests that the remaining chapters 10 to 18 of the Guideways did not originally form part of Liu Xin’s edition and were combined with chapters 1 to 9 at a later date, as suggested by Guo Pu.

261. T H E X I A O Y A N G P E O P L E ( X I A O Y A N G M I N )  ̇ß¡ The Land of the Xiaoyang People is located west of the Land of the Beiqu People. The people have human faces, long lips, black bodies, and are hairy. Their heels are reversed, and when they see people laughing, they also laugh. In their left hands they carry a tube.444 The Land of the Xiaoyang People is located in chapter 10, “Guideway through the Southern Lands within the Sea,” which extends westward from the southeast corner. There are a number of similar descriptions of such creatures in early texts. The Recovered Documents of Zhou, for example, calls them Fufu and locates them in the Land of Zhoumi in the north, while Guo Pu quoted the Great Commentary to the Documents of Antiquity (Shangshu dazhuan, 2nd cent. b.c.e.) that the Land of Zhoumi presented some to the court during the reign of King Cheng of the Zhou (r. c. 1042–1006 b.c.e.). He further maintained that such creatures dwelled in Jiaozhi (modern Vietnam) and identified the Xiaoyang with beasts also called Fufu recorded in Approaching Refinement, though the graphs are written slightly di erently. Gao You’s commentary to the Master of Huainan regarded them as mountain spirits. Hao Yixing quoted A Record of Strange Things (Yiwuzhi, c. 90 c.e.), which described them in more detail:
PLATES LIII–LIV 187



The Xiaoyang like to eat humans, and they have large mouths. When they first capture someone, they laugh so hard that their upper lip rises over their foreheads. Then, after a while, they eat the person. But knowing that the Xiaoyang carries its arm in a tube, people wait until it grabs hold of someone, then they pull its arm through the tube, nail its upper lip to its forehead, and capture it.
Based on this passage, Yuan Ke believed that the Xiaoyang spontaneously laughed rather than only in response to people. Almost identical creatures called Giants of Gan [no. 339] are recorded in chapter 18.445

18 further states that this is in the area of Changsha and Lingling (in modern Hunan) and locates the tomb specifically on the Mountain of Nine Similar Peaks. Si-Rhinoceros are mentioned in nine places in the Guideways [see no. 26]. Such animals appear in ancient carvings and apparently dwelled north of the Yellow River as late as the Shang. The Bamboo Annals recorded that in the sixteenth year of the reign of King Zhao of the Zhou (c. 962 b.c.e.), huge Si-Rhinoceros were encountered in a military campaign against Chu after the Zhou army crossed the Han River in what is now central China. As late as the Tang, there were still native rhinoceros in the area of present-day Hunan, though exotic species for imperial parks were imported, mostly from Champa in modern Vietnam. Based on epigraphical and archaeological evidence, some modern scholars have argued that the ancient Si was not a rhinoceros at all but a wild bu alo.447
263. X I N G X I N G dd The Xingxing can identify people by name. They are beasts that resemble pigs but with human faces. They are located west of Shun’s Tomb.448 Yuan Ke believed this Xingxing to be a variant of no. 2, although the physical descriptions are di erent. Guo Pu noted that in his time, Xingxing dwelled in Fengxi district, Jiaozhi (modern Vietnam). The Xingxing, written with di erent graphs, is also recorded in chapter 18. There, it is said to be a green beast with a human face, and Guo Pu noted that it can speak. The Compendium of Mr. Lü regarded its lips as a delicacy. Other early accounts, however, give further varying descriptions such as the Recovered Documents of Zhou, which says that it resembles a yellow dog with a rooster’s head and that eating it can cure nightmares. The Master of Huainan says it understands the past but not the future, to which Gao You added that it was a beast of the north but with a human face and a beast’s body, and it was yellow.449
264. X I - R H I N O C E R O S ( X I N I U ) R ̊ Northwest of the Xingxing dwell Xi-Rhinoceros. Their form resembles an ox that is black.450 The Xi-Rhinoceros appears in ten places in the Guideways and is also illustrated in chapter 1 [no. 26]. Guo Pu commented here that it resembles a water bu alo with the head of a pig and has short legs and three horns. Rhinoceros horn has long been associated with male potency and was used for decorative carvings such as wine cups. Despite the decimation of the remaining population in the world, the horn continues to be in demand in traditional Chinese medicine.451
265. Y A Y U K’ Yayu has a dragon’s head and dwells in the Weak River west of the Xingxing [no. 263] who know people’s names. His form resembles a dragon’s head, and he is a man-eater.452 The Weak River is usually said to be located near Mount Kunlun. A creature also named Yayu previously appeared in chapter 3 but was described di erently [see no. 108]. Here he has been transformed from his original appearance as a god with a snake’s body and a human face. Yayu was killed by Erfu [no. 281] and his minister, Wei [no. 268], who were later punished by the Supreme God. Yayu is also mentioned in chapter 11 [no. 270], where his corpse was revived by wu-shamans west of the Beast-Facing-East [no. 269], guardian of Mount Kunlun. They gave him the NeverDying Herb, and he then metamorphosed into this form.453

The people have a human face and a fish’s body, and they lack feet.454 The Firm-Tree, illustrated here, is a kind of “world tree” described as resembling an ox with bark like cap strings or yellow snakes. It grows west of Yayu by the Weak River and is used by supreme gods and thearchs to travel between heaven and earth. Another description and location of it is provided in chapter 18, where it is said to have green leaves, purple veins, black flowers, and yellow fruit. It stands one hundred ren (800 ft.) high without any branches and was used by Greater-Brilliance (Taihao) and the Yellow Thearch. Concerning the Di People, Guo Pu noted that they were human from the waist up and fish below. Commentators believed that they are the same as the Hu People recorded in chapter 16, the graph of whose name may be a variant of Di. The Hu People are descended from Lingqi, a grandson of the Flame Thearch, and they can travel between heaven and earth.455

If a gentleman wears part of it against his skin, he will not su er from heart or lung ailments. It is green, yellow, red, and black. According to another version, it is described as a black snake with a green head. It is located west of the Xi-Rhinoceros [no. 264].456 Explanations and Analyses of Graphs defines ba as originally a pictograph of a snake eating an elephant. A black snake with a green head that devours elephants at Mount Vermilion-Roll, which Guo Pu believed was the BaSnake, is recorded in chapter 18. He and other commentators considered it a kind of python and likened it to other snakes found in the south as far as Jiaozhi (modern Vietnam) that were commonly known to devour deer and that were also used for medicine. A creature similar to the Ba-Snake is mentioned as early as the “Questions of Heaven,” which asks, “How can the snake that can swallow an elephant devour its bones?” The Master of Huainan states that a long snake was killed by Yi the Archer at Grotto Lake. Later commentators to both texts identified these snakes with the Ba-Snake of the Guideways. These myths were further elaborated in the city of Baling (literally, “hill of the Ba-Snake,” in modern Hunan) beside Grotto Lake at least since the Song. After it was killed by Yi the Archer, the snake was said to have been buried under a large hill in the city, where a temple was later built to worship its spirit. A pond next to Elephant-Bones Mountain nearby is supposed to be where the Ba-Snake expelled the elephant’s bones. Images of the predatory Ba-Snake about to swallow an elephant continued to fascinate the popular imagination, and a fine rendition by the late Ming artist Xiao Yuncong (1596–1673) circulated in a book of woodblock prints titled Illustrations to the “Questions of Heaven” (Tianwentu, early to mid 17th cent., see fig. 24) around the same time as these illustrations to the Guideways.457

fettered, both his hands and hair were fastened behind his back, and he was tied up to a tree on the mountain. This is northwest of the Land of Kaiti.458 The Minister of Erfu is located at the beginning of chapter 11, “Guideway through the Western Lands within the Sea,” which extends northward from the southeast corner. The Land of Kaiti is actually recorded at the end of the previous chapter, but according to Wu Chengzhi (fl. early 20th cent.), that section probably belongs here. Erfu is also recorded in chapter 12 as a corpse and as a god with a snake’s body and human head [see no. 281], and Wu also believed that this passage in chapter 11 was wrongly placed here by later editors. Guo Pu expressed the view that the Minister of Erfu’s long hair was used to tie up his hands. Yuan Ke believed that this description reflected the early illustrations and also identified the Supreme God Di mentioned here with the Yellow Thearch. This is the passage that the court bibliographer Liu Xiang (79–8 b.c.e.) quoted to Emperor Xuan of the Han (r. 74–49 b.c.e.) to explain the discovery of a bound corpse in a cave. His son, Liu Xin, claimed that this passage led to a revival of interest in the Guideways among scholars at the time, including

the Ru-Confucians. The obvious di erence between the two locations has led commentators to articulate elaborate theories about the ability of corpses or other spiritual figures to transform themselves and move about. Another figure similarly punished is the Corpse of Minister Gu recorded in chapter 18.459

Yuan Ke suggested that he might be identical to the god Luwu [no. 60] mentioned earlier based on their similar forms. Here the Guideways o ers a further description of the mythical Mount Kunlun:
Mount Kunlun within the sea is in the northwest and is the earthly capital of the Supreme God Di. It is eight hundred li in circumference and ten thousand ren

high (eighty thousand feet). On its heights is the Grain-Tree which is five xun (forty feet) high and five arm spans around. The front of Mount Kunlun contains nine wells encompassed by jade railings and nine gates guarded by a Beast-FacingEast. This is where a hundred gods dwell in the caverns of an eight-cornered cli bordered by the Red River. Only Humane Yi the Archer (Ren Yi) can climb to the ridge of this cli .
The Grain-Tree apparently produces an abundant source of food, while the wells are said to be of the highest purity, their water being considered superior in The Compendium of Mr. Lü. Yi the Archer is noted for having rescued humankind by shooting down nine of the ten suns, among other deeds. In addition to five rivers flowing forth from the mountain, there is a pool on its south side that is 300 ren (2,400 feet) deep.462

Yayu has a snake’s body and a human face. He was killed by the Minister of Erfu [no. 268].463 This apparently is Yayu’s original form before he transformed into a snake with a dragon head as well as other shapes [see nos. 108, 265]. This form is identical to that of Erfu [no. 281]. The shamans are acting here as “divine physicians.”

The illustrator has apparently taken artistic license by representing the Fenghuang-Bird with a spear. Feng-Birds or FenghuangBirds appear in eight places in the Guideways and Luan-Birds in ten. The Feng/FenghuangBird is usually given primacy in Chinese mythology; however, the iconography and significance of the Luan-Bird is sometimes indistinguishable from it. Recorded as early as the Shang dynasty oracle-bone inscriptions, the Feng-/Fenghuang-Bird emerged in Zhou texts as a primary omen of political harmony. In what is probably a later interpolation, it is recorded in chapter 1 at Cinnabar Cave Mountain as a symbol of Confucian values. It is described as five-colored and resembling a chicken with the markings of the graph for virtue on its head, duty on its wings, ritual on its back, humaneness on its breast, and trust on its stomach. It eats, drinks, sings, and dances at will and, if seen, is an omen of world peace. Elsewhere, in chapters 7 and 16, the Feng-Bird and LuanBird are found in paradisical places where the people consumed their eggs. Though almost universally mistranslated in the West as the “phoenix,” with which it has little in common, the Feng-Bird’s origins have been traced by some modern scholars to the ostrich, eagle, pheasant, or peacock. Its depiction has varied over the centuries and be

come increasingly flamboyant. Later, it was commonly paired with the Luan-Bird or dragon as an imperial symbol and has become a popular decorative motif denoting yin-yang conjugal harmony.466
272. T H E T H R E E - H E A D E D M A N ( S A N T O U R E N ) TYH On top of the Fuchang-Tree is a Three-Headed Man who oversees the Langgan-Tree.467 Guo Pu was unable to identify the Fuchang-Tree, but the commentator Wu Renchen thought it may be a misprint for the Sand-Pear mentioned instead in a similar passage in the Master of Huainan, which locates both it and the Langgan-Tree on Mount Kunlun. Guo identified langgan as a kind of pearl, which the Approaching Refinement considered as one of the treasures of the northwest. He also cited a now-missing passage in the Master Zhuang stating that the Three-Headed Man alternately sleeps and awakes. The artist has apparently illustrated this by creating two images of him. Yuan Ke hypothesized that the man is Li Zhu, who in another myth was dispatched in vain by the Yellow Thearch to search for a treasured black pearl that the thearch had lost while on Mount Kunlun.468

Both he and Yuan Ke identified the Six-Headed Bird with the Chu-Bird [no. 326] described in chapter 16 as a green bird with a yellow body, red feet, and six heads. The Jiao-Dragon is found in five places in the Guideways. Guo Pu only noted here that it resembles a snake with four feet and is a type of dragon. However, in chapter 5, where it is found in the Han River, he commented that it had a small head and a narrow neck with a white goiter. Large ones were more than ten arm spans in width and could swallow a person whole. In traditional Chinese belief, it was thought to dwell in watery bodies or to be hidden under the desert sands and was generally regarded as malevolent. These confused images of the Six-Headed Bird and the Jiao-Dragon seem to be the result of the illustrator’s misreading of the text as meaning “a bird and a Six-Headed JiaoDragon.” In addition, probably for the sake of the composition, he decided to locate the bird on the Fuchang-Tree, along with the Three-Headed Man [no. 272].470

She is located north of Mount Kunlun toward the beginning of the guideway through the northern lands within the seas, which extends eastward from the northwest corner. In chapter 16, she is recorded again as a god with a human face and a tiger’s body with stripes and a tail, both white, and as dwelling on Mount Kunlun. A further description is appended to this that almost repeats the entry here and adds that she lives in a cave. Both Yuan Ke and Hao Yixing believed that the graph zhang (“sta ”) was mistakenly added later. The illustration here, however, indicates the sta but not the low table, while also including the leopard’s tail mentioned in the earlier and later entries. Guo Pu tried to resolve the textual discrepancies in the location of the Queen Mother of the West by stating that she had her primary residence on Mount Kunlun with additional residences on other mountains.472

The text also suggests that the early illustrations depicted a kneeling girl o ering one of them food and wine. Guo Pu commented that they are the o spring of a two-headed, white, hermaphroditic dog sired by Bianming, a descendant of the Yellow Thearch, and that their land is also simply known as the Land of the Canines. The Dog People are also mentioned in chapter 17 as fourth-generation descendants of the Yellow Thearch and as carnivorous.

People. A number of tribes in the northwest were collectively referred to as the Rong and as the Dog People, and the Dog-Rong were considered the group farthest to the west. The more neighboring Rong tribes occasionally caused military and diplomatic problems for the Chinese feudal states but also interacted with them as tributaries and allies. Some also migrated to areas within the Chinese world in the northwest. Mathieu believed that the association of this particular tribe in the Guideways with dogs is totemic and that the descent from a hermaphoditic dog signifies highly endogamous practices. Myths of dog ancestors can also be found in the south and southwest. The most notable of these is the story of the dog Panhu. In early written versions, he is variously credited with fathering the population of a similarly named Land of the Dog People or the southern Man-Barbarian tribes. Even today, some southern minority tribes still claim descent from him. For another di erently described creature in the Guideways also named Quanrong who dwells in the Land of the Dog People, see no. 334.477

These were obtained by Shang and Zhou dynasty kings from the Dog People through tribute or purchase. Guo Pu’s encomium celebrates one legend that such a horse was presented as ransom for Bochang, later King Wen of the Zhou (r. c. 1099–1050 b.c.e.), enabling him to escape imprisonment by the last Shang king, Zhou (trad. r. c. 1150–1099 b.c.e.):
With eyes of gold and mane of red, He races like a dragon and halts like a thoroughbred. Soaring high like geese and ducks, Stirring up the dust belowThis is Lucky-Measure Who rescued a sage from the village of You.
Attributing divine qualities to Lucky-Measure is similar to the celebration of Yellow-Steed [no. 238] and a further reflection of the military importance to the Chinese of fine Central Asian horses.479

tion of demons or ghosts, which were identified with barbarian tribes, can be seen as early as the Shang dynasty oracle-bones, which recorded a land known as the Realm of the Demon People (Guifang). The Book of Changes (Yijing, 9th cent. b.c.e.–2nd cent. c.e.) and The Bamboo Annals state that King Wuding of the Shang (trad. r. 12731224 b.c.e.) conquered it in 1240 b.c.e. after an arduous campaign of three years that was criticized in an ode in the Book of Songs (Shijing, c. 1000–600 b.c.e.).

According to another version, he devours people feet first.486 That Thoroughly-Odd prefers to devour those with long hair suggests that he may be particularly dangerous to wu-shamans or to demons. His hair is like the spines of hedgehogs, according to Guo Pu. Thoroughly-Odd was also mentioned in chapter 2 [no. 83] where he is said to dwell at Mount Gui and is described as a maneater resembling an ox with hedgehog’s hair who makes a sound like an angry dog. Various other early texts also mention figures named Thoroughly-Odd, though with differing descriptions. Zuo’s Narratives lists him as a wayward o spring of the thearch Lesser-Brilliance, whose tribe of descendants are finally banished to the periphery and charged with controlling the Chimei-Hobgoblins [see no. 287]. Gao You’s commentary to the Master of Huainan said that Thoroughly-Odd was born of the Northern Desert Wind. During the Han, he was one of twelve gods who chased away evil demons in the Grand Exorcism ritual and was considered particularly e ective against insect-poison. Guo Pu’s encomium praises Thoroughly-Odd’s exorcistic ability despite his ugly appearance and calls him a Divine Dog. This description in the Guideways was further elaborated in the Guideway to Gods and Anomalies, where Thoroughly-Odd was given a morally perverse disposition:
To the northwest is a beast resembling a tiger with wings who can fly and who also catches and devours men. He understands human language, and when he hears men quarreling, he immediately devours the one who is right. When he hears of someone who is loyal and trustworthy, he immediately eats their nose; if he hears someone who is rebellious and evil, he immediately kills an animal and presents it to him. He is called Thoroughly-Odd and devours all other kinds of birds and beasts.487

The Chimei are sometimes associated with yet another group, the Wangliang-Goblins. All are dangerous creatures lurking in the mountains and waters who are said to attack unwary travelers, but descriptions of their appearances vary.

Chu anthology. It has a pig’s head, vertical eyes, and long hair. Another description was later provided by the Eastern Han scholar Fu Qian (fl. c. 184–189), who stated that the Chimei have human faces on beasts’ bodies and four legs. According to Zuo’s Narratives, it was to help the common people identify the Chimei and Wangliang and to avoid danger that Yu the Great had the Nine Bronze Vessels cast with illustrations of strange creatures. The same text also states that the thearch Shun while still a minister of the thearch Yao banished four rebellious tribes, including those of Hundun [see no. 73] and Thoroughly-Odd [no. 283], to the four ends of the world to control the Chimei in these barbaric places.495
288. R O N G • The Rong are a people with human heads and three horns.496 These people, like the Dog People [no. 278], are also considered one of the Rong tribes, but since they dwell closer to the Chinese heartland, they are somewhat less strange in appearance, though not by much. Mathieu surmised that the three “horns” might actually be a headdress or shamanistic hairstyle. Hao Yixing believed that these people were the Lirong mentioned in the Recovered Documents of Zhou:
In the past, the Lin Clan summoned the ruler of the Lirong to its court, but when he arrived, they failed to treat him according to the proper ritual. The ruler was held without being granted an audience until he escaped and fled. The Lin Clan had him killed, and then the world revolted against them.
The Land of the Lin Clan is mentioned in the next passage in the Guideways [see no. 289]. They were considered overbearing nobles whose domain, according to the Recovered Documents of Zhou, was later destroyed in a conflict with the rival Shangheng Clan.497

Guo Pu noted a myth in the Six Bow-Bags (Liutao, c. late 3rd cent. b.c.e.) that is virtually identical to the one about Lucky-Measure [no. 279]. In this case, it is the Zouwu that is obtained from the Land of the Lin Clan and presented to King Zhou of the Shang as a ransom for Bochang, the future King Wen of the Zhou.499

the clouds on chariots pulled by two dragons. In some early accounts, he is described as having a white, human face and a fish’s body as in the Master Shi when he encountered Yu the Great and bestowed on him the River Diagram, a magic square of the cosmos. The Yellow River was believed to originate at Mount Kunlun, and the cult of this river god was important to the religious life of the northwestern and central Chinese states, eventually spreading to the more southern ones as well. As late as the Warring States period, human and animal sacrifices to the god were still drowned in the river, including young women destined to become the god’s “wives.” In one of “The Nine Songs” in the Songs of Chu anthology, the performer narrates a wedding journey with him in a chariot drawn by two dragons. The Master Zhuang noted that the wu-shamans and zhu-priests in charge of such rituals considered oxen with white foreheads, pigs with turned-up snouts, and humans with piles to be unsuitable o erings to him. Others attempted to pacify him or gain his favor by drowning horses and casting gold, jade, and other valuables into the river. As the personification of the awesome power of the Yellow River, this god was thus regarded as occasionally benevolent but also greedy, unpredictable, and dangerously destructive. Some myths celebrate his pun

ishment and even execution. The “Questions of Heaven” poem refers to a myth about Yi the Archer shooting Lord of the River to which the Han commentator Wang Yi added the following story:
Lord of the River transformed himself into a white dragon and was traveling alongside the river when Yi the Archer saw him and shot an arrow at him, hitting his left eye. Lord of the River complained to the Supreme God of Heaven, Di, and said, “Kill Yi to avenge me!” The Supreme God asked, “Why were you struck by an arrow?” and he answered, “I had transformed myself into a white dragon and was traveling about.” The Supreme God stated, “If you had only dedicated yourself to carrying out your duties as a god, how would Yi have transgressed? Now you became a beast, and it is natural that someone would shoot at you. Yi acted properly, so what crime has he committed?”
The Master of Huainan stated more explicitly that Yi shot at Lord of the River because the latter had drowned people. Lord of the River was historicized in later Chinese religion, which provided various biographies of him as a human who had cultivated spiritual powers or had been appointed after death by the Supreme God. In his encomium, Guo Pu celebrated him as a kind of Daoist Transcendent while alluding to a fable in the Master Zhuang in which the proud Lord of the River flows down in autumn to meet Ruo, the god of the Northern Sea, only to discover his relative insignificance:
Endowed with the essences of flowers, Eight precious minerals does he eat. Astride dragons, he hides within the torrent, Flowing onwards, the sea-god Ruo to meet. Indeed he is a Transcendent of the waters: “Lord of the River” is his name, complete.
The Lord of the River also appears in chapter 14 in connection with King Hai [no. 300] and the Youyi People.501

According to Guo Pu, the crab is one thousand li in size. A giant crab is also mentioned in chapter 14 where it is owned by Woman Chou (Nüchou) who is probably identical to the Corpse of Woman Chou [no. 317], a shamaness. Among other early Chinese texts, a giant crab in the Northern Sea is also mentioned in the Recovered Documents of Zhou while The Compendium of Mr. Lü notes the existence of the giant crab together with the Hill-Fish [no. 292] and states that these barbarian areas, unlike the civilized Chinese states, lack sovereigns. Mathieu suggests that this “Giant Crab” must be the name of an island and notes that the northern Pacific Ocean has always contained large crabs which some local peoples have deified.503

However, as Yuan Ke pointed out, they are all fish with human characteristics rather than mermen or mermaids. The latter appear somewhat later in Chinese mythology, beginning in the Northern and Southern Dynasties period.

tant role of Mount Penglai in later Chinese religion and mythology. Like the Supreme Mountain, it was a major spiritual site promoted by the fangshi-wizards, and the relative unimportance of these places in the text suggests that they were originally more significant to eastern Chinese beliefs, whereas the Guideways primarily records western and southern myths and presents Mount Kunlun as the axis mundi. The search for paradisical isles in the Gulf of Bohai apparently began in the Warring States period and was recorded by Sima Qian in his Historical Records:
Ever since the time of Kings Wei (r. 356–320 b.c.e.) and Xuan (r. 319–301 b.c.e.) of Qi (modern Shandong) and King Zhao (r. 311–279 b.c.e.) of Yan (modern Hebei), expeditions were dispatched to the three divine islands of Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou. They were said to lie in the Gulf of Bohai not far beyond where men dwelled. Unfortunately, whenever anyone approached them, winds would arise and blow his boat o course. No doubt, some must have arrived there in the past. All the Transcendents and the Never-Dying Herb can be found there. Everything including birds and beasts are white, while the palaces are made of gold and silver. Before some reached these places, they appeared from afar like clouds, but as they arrived, the three divine islands submerged into the sea. As the people approached, winds suddenly arose and carried their boats farther away so that in the end, none of them were able to get there. Every ruler has yearned for these places.
Fangshi-wizards continued to propound myths of Penglai and the other islands to credulous emperors during the Qin and Han dynasties. Some supported costly expeditions to find them, most notably the First Emperor of Qin. Since none were successful, in later centuries the search was gradually abandoned, though Penglai became a major paradise in religious Daoism rivaling Mount Kunlun and a popular symbol of immortality. That this brief entry without further details is the sole mention of it in the Guideways may suggest that the cult of Penglai was either in its infancy or that its actual location was regarded as an occult secret not to be widely disseminated.509

Yuan Ke argued that Thunder Lake is the Great Lake, also known in antiquity as Thundering Lake, just west of the city of Wu (modern Suzhou, Jiangsu). As the text indicates, this god creates thunder by using his stomach as a drum. In another myth in chapter 14, he appears to have been killed by the Yellow Thearch, who frightens the world by using a bone of the Thunder God to beat a drum made from the skin of the beast Kui [no. 304], which can be heard for five hundred li.511

In the latter entry, it is also identified as the source of the Han River, which geographers locate in modern southwestern Shaanxi. Another name for the mountain may be Mount Bozhong, which in chapter 2 is also identified as the source of the Han River. The tomb, therefore, seems to be in the northwest, and Hao Yixing suggested that it is mistakenly recorded in this chapter.

of this passage recorded that he extended his two arms instead of his ears. Mathieu commented that the Giant must be crouching down while selling merchandise at the market. In chapter 12, the market of the Giants is said to be located in the Northern Sea. Commentators such as Yang Shen and Hao Yixing speculated that this may have been a mirage seen by sailors o the coast of Shandong. A Land of Giants is also mentioned in chapter 9, where the people are said to sit down in order to punt their boats. It is also recorded in chapter 17, in which the inhabitants are surnamed Li and eat millet. Yuan Ke argued that several early sources record that they were descended from the Yellow Thearch. All these passages refer to the north or east, leading to speculation that ancient mythology located such a giant people somewhere between China and the Korean Peninsula. Other early Chinese texts contain a number of myths about tribes of giants, some of whom are said to grow to fantastic proportions.515

300. K I N G H A I  ̋Ë There is someone named King Hai who is grasping a bird in each hand and is about to eat their heads. King Hai entrusted his oxen to the leader of the Youyi People and to the Lord of the River. The leader of the Youyi killed King Hai and stole the oxen. But the Lord of the River took pity on the leader of the Youyi who took refuge underwater and emerged to establish his own kingdom among the wild beasts. The people are shown about to eat them. They are called the Yao People. The thearch Shun begat Xi, and Xi begat the Yao People.520 King Hai (trad. d. 1714 b.c.e.) was mentioned in the “Questions of Heaven” and in a number of early myths and historical accounts that vary as to details as well as to his identity. Also known as King Gai in some versions, he is the seventh king of the Shang people, in others, the Marquis of Yin (i.e., Shang) or Crown Prince of Shang during the Xia dynasty. Here the Guideways records fragments of a myth that has been loosely reconstructed with other evidence from The Bamboo Annals and the “Questions of Heaven”: King Hai was visiting the Youyi tribe and entrusted his herd of oxen to them and to Hebo, the Lord of the Yellow River [no. 290]. However, Hai was killed by Mianchen, leader of the Youyi, because he had an a air with Mianchen’s wife and impregnated her. Hai’s younger brother, Shangjia Wei, succeeded to the Shang throne and avenged him by compelling the Lord of the River to give him military support, killing Mianchen and destroying the Land of the Youyi. The Lord of the River, out of friendship for the Youyi, secretly transformed them into the Yao People (literally, the “shaking people”). In the traditional dating of The Bamboo Annals, King Hai was killed in 1714 b.c.e. and avenged four years later by Shangjia Wei. Birrell considers this myth significant as an example of the motif of the first cattle raid found in other cultures, while the Chinese historical tradition regarded King Hai’s transgression as indicative of the moral decline of the Shang state, which was reversed by Shangjia Wei’s campaign of revenge. The final passage in the Guideways presents an alternate genealogy of the Yao People, where they claim a more prestigious ancestor.521

When one sun arrives here, another leaves, and they are all borne by a crow.522 Guo Pu noted that the crow has three feet in accordance with references to this myth in a number of other early texts. He also identified Hot-Springs Valley with Hot-Valley and the Supporting-Tree with the Supporting-Mulberry Tree. The cycle of ten suns, which set out from and return to the top of this world tree in the east, has been regarded as an important founding myth of the Shang dynasty. It is also mentioned in chapter 9, which states that nine suns rest on the lower branches, while one occupies the topmost. The suns are believed to represent the ten days of the week in the ancient calendar.523

The divine Luan- and Feng-Birds [nos. 49, 271] are usually described as varieties of five-colored birds. Here Yuan Ke suggested that only Thearch Jun can consort with these birds because he was originally Black-Bird. Guo Pu identified the thearch of the altars they oversee as Shun. In a subsequent passage in this chapter, more Five-Colored Birds are mentioned, following a list of mountains without further comment.527

The Yellow Thearch obtained him and made his skin into a drum, which he beats with the bone of the Thunder-Beast. The sound can be heard for five hundred li and creates terror throughout the world.528 Kui is described with varying appearances in several other early texts. He was historicized in the chapter on the thearch Yao in the Documents of Antiquity (Shangshu, Zhou dynasty) as an o‹cial whom Yao placed in charge of music and who could miraculously make animals dance. In other myths, the use of Kui’s skin as a drum to create terror is also part of the power struggle between the Yellow Thearch and Chiyou in which the latter loses his ability to fly and is killed when frightened by the drumbeats. Guo Pu identified the Thunder-Beast with the God of Thunder [no. 295]. The Kui remained a creature in later mythology, in which he is sometimes described as a dragon.

When there is a drought, people make an image of Winged-Dragon in order to obtain rain.530 Winged-Dragon killed Chiyou and Kuafu the Boaster here on the orders of the Yellow Thearch. The droughts occurred on earth below because he could no longer send down rain from the mountain. Guo Pu noted the persistence of the custom of fashioning images of WingedDragon in his time but stated his belief that weather responded to natural conditions and could not be induced by human prayers. Another early myth about WingedDragon in the “Questions of Heaven” associates him with the e orts of Yu the Great to control the rivers. He is said by the commentator Wang Yi to have used his tail to

These birds are apparently in charge of controlling the Black-Snakes to protect the Supreme God’s herbs, which are probably Never-Dying Herbs.

There are people here with three bodies. Thearch Jun and his wife Ehuang established this Land of the Three-Bodies People. They bear the surname Yao, eat millet, and command four kinds of birds. There is a square gorge with four corners, each of which connects to other rivers. On the north, it becomes the Black River, and on the south it leads to the Great Wilds. The one on the north is called the Gorge of Lesser Harmony, and the one on the south is called the Vertical Gorge. The latter is where Shun bathed.538 The Three-Bodies People were also recorded in chapter 7 [see no. 229]. Hao Yixing and Yuan Ke believed that it was Shun, rather than Thearch Jun, who begat the Three-Bodies People or that the two figures have been identified with each other here. Ehuang was the wife of Shun, and, as Guo Pu noted, Yao was the surname of Shun. One of the birds that the Three-Bodies People train is indicated to the right.539

He is called Butinghuyu.540 This god has not been further identified. However, the graphs for buting may mean “rebel” or one who does not send tribute to the Chinese court, as in “Rebel Mountain” [see no. 309]. “Huyu” may be a word used by the ancient Ba People in modern Sichuan to denote foreigners.541

They are surnamed Ji and eat fine grains.544 They were mentioned in chapter 6 as the Zhourao People [no. 225]. Guo Pu noted here that they are three feet high. In addition to the Tiny People [no. 298] in the previous chapter, this chapter records yet another midget people, the Mushroom People, but without providing any details.545
313. H U A N T O U ¬Y In the middle of the Great Wilds to the west is someone named Huantou. Gun’s wife, Tujing, had a son named Fire-Melt (Yanrong) who begat Huantou. Huatou has a human face with a bird’s beak and feathers. He eats fish from the sea and uses his wings as sticks to walk. He consumes Qi-Berries, Black-Millet, Lu-Grain, and the poplar tree. There is a Land of Huantou here.546 Before this passage is a similar one stating that “there is someone with a bird’s beak and wings who is catching fish in the sea.” It is assumed to also refer to Huantou and probably describes an early illustration, which the artist followed here. The land and people of Huantou were

recorded earlier in chapter 6 [no. 217] but appear here again with the addition of a genealogy from Gun. The identification of the items in Huantou’s choice of food remains obscure; however, the “Questions of Heaven” mentions that after Gun was revived by wu-shamans, they both went about sowing ju, written with a variant graph that means “black millet.” Myths of Huantou became amalgamated with those about Danzhu as indicated by the alternate name for this land in chapter 6, “Huanzhu.” As historicized in a number of early texts, Danzhu was the unworthy son of Yao who was passed over for the succession in favor of the more virtuous Shun, an outsider to the royal lineage. With the aid of the Three-Sprouts People [see nos. 71, 218, 335], he revolted but was defeated and either was killed or committed suicide. The Three-Sprouts People, who had advanced northward during the neolithic period, were exiled back to the distant south, where they are traditionally said to have become the Man-Barbarians, and Yao took pity on Danzhu’s descendants and gave them their own land in the south. As Birrell has pointed out, the myth of Danzhu may have served to explain an archaic social practice of eliminating a competitor for tribal power

PLATE LXIX
314. G O N G G O N G @u Beyond the Northwest Sea in a corner of the Great Wilds to the West is a mountain that is split called Cleft Mountain. Two yellow beasts guard it. There is a river called Winter-and-Summer River. West of the river stands Wet Mountain, and east of the river is Tent Mountain. There is a Mountain Where Yu Attacked the Land of Gonggong.548 Gonggong is an ancient god who may originally have been a personification of the Deluge, but he was transformed into a violent figure in later mythology. Perhaps he had been venerated under the Shang dynasty and was degraded under the succeeding Zhou. The Guideways only records the Mountain Where Yu Attacked the Land of Gonggong here in chapter 16, “Guideway through the Great Wilds to the West.” The name of this mountain refers to a historicized myth in which the thearch Yao orders his o‹cial, the future thearch Yu the Great, to attack Gonggong while Yu is in the process of quelling the floods. The struggle results in the death of Gonggong’s o‹cial, Minister Liu [no. 244]. Guo Pu quoted the Explanations of Divinations in the Storehouse of All Things, stating that Gongong has a human face, a snake’s body, and red hair, a description the illustrator apparently followed. Cleft Mountain is the location of another myth set in an earlier period in which Gongong rebels against the thearch Zhuanxu and splits the mountain in the course of battle. According to versions preserved in the “Questions of Heaven” and the Master of Huainan, this destroyed a pillar of heaven, resulting in the sky with its heavenly bodies tilting toward the northwest, while the rivers and the silt they carried flowed into a cavity created in the southeast. Still other myths suggest that Gonggong was either exiled or executed by various thearchs.549

no arms whose two feet are attached to his head. His name is Blow. Zhuanxu begat Old Child (Laotong), and Old Child begat Chong and Li. The Supreme God ordered Chong to elevate heaven so that it would stay above and Li to depress the earth so that it would remain below. On earth below Li begat Ye, who dwells at the Western Extremity, where he coordinates the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and constellations.558 This passage presents a number of textual di‹culties. The meaning of the two graphs for Wuju is not clear. Most commentators and translators have understood the actions of Chong and Li to be based on the story recorded in the Conversations from the Feudal States in which the thearch Zhuanxu orders them to sever the connection between heaven and earth to prevent social chaos caused by the uncontrolled interactions between humans and gods. Yuan Ke further identified Ye as Blow, though this remains hypothetical. In early China, hereditary o‹cials with responsibilites for astrology and calendrical calculation evolved into the grand historians, such as Sima Qian, who traced his own lineage back to Chong and Li. Although not specifically stated, Blow’s name suggests that he may also be a wind god.559

But Geng stood up without his head and fled from his calamity, finally finding refuge at Shaman Mountain.566 According to the traditional dating of The Bamboo Annals, Tang the Victorious conquered Jie in 1558 b.c.e. Guo Pu considered Geng to be similar to Xingtian [no. 233] as a vanquished hero who regenerated himself and continued his resistance.567

The Compendium of Mr. Lü recorded a “Land of the OneArmed, Three-Faced” once visited by Yu the Great. Guo Pu believed in the probability of such a person by comparing it to the passage later included in the “Treatise on the Eastern Yi-Barbarians” about the Governor of Xuantu, Wang Qi [see no. 226]. Upon arriving at the Land of the Woju (Ökcho) Tribe in modern northeast Korea, Wang learned from local elders about a shipwrecked sailor who had two faces.

Kai ascended to heaven three times as a guest and obtained “The Nine Arguments” (Jiubian) and “The Nine Songs,” which he brought down when he descended. At this place called the Plain of Celestial Majesty, two thousand ren [16,000 feet] high, he first sung “The Nine Summons” (Jiuzhao).570
The son of Yu the Great, Kai is recorded earlier in chapter 7 [no. 228] by his original name, Qi. At the end of this chapter is a note by an unknown commentator indicating that Qi was changed to Kai to avoid the taboo personal name of Liu Qi, Emperor Jing of the Western Han (r. 157–141 b.c.e.). This note indicates that this chapter of the Guideways, and probably chapters 14 to 18 as a group, were more heavily edited after Liu Qi’s reign. This passage about the Xia Sovereign Kai (Qi) also locates him elsewhere than the earlier one and presents varying details about his role as a culture hero.571

Tall-Breastplate killed Generous-Man (Chuoren), but the Supreme God took pity on Generous-Man and secretly established him in his own kingdom. This was the origin of the Hairy People.573 The Hairy People were earlier recorded in chapter 9 but located in the eastern lands beyond the sea [see no. 258].

The Yellow Thearch then sent down his divine daughter who was named Ba, and the rain ceased. Afterward, Chiyou was killed, but Drought-Fury was unable to ascend back to heaven.

as Ancestral-God of the Fields. Ba occasionally escapes, and anyone who wishes to expell her should utter, “O Goddess, get ye north!” Before doing so, clean out the water channels, and dredge the canals and irrigation ditches.582 Drought-Fury is a figure widely found in popular religion who was ritually expelled from a locality su ering from lack of rain. Shamanesses such as the Corpse of Woman Chou [no. 317] who were ritually exposed to obtain rain may have been performing impersonations of Drought-Fury. This passage also contains a rare shamanistic curse to ward o Drought-Fury, which is probably an interpolation. Guo Pu noted that in his time such ceremonies were still held, and Drought-Fury continued to appear in later mythology as well. Hao Yixing recorded various later accounts that describe her as bald and as standing from one to three feet tall with additional eyes on her forehead and able to move as rapidly as the wind. The discovery of her body was even o‹cially reported on a few occasions. The location of the critical battle between Chiyou and the Yellow Thearch varies according to the account.

They are mentioned again in this chapter several passages before this one, where they are described as descendants of the Yellow Thearch and as hermaphrodites who are also known as the White-Dogs. This passage is then followed by the mention of another figure, the Corpse of King Xuan of the Rong, who is a headless red beast with the form of a horse. Although the creature here named Quanrong is identified as a god, Hao Yixing considered this an error and believed that he is human and one of the Dog People. Mathieu, on the other hand, pointed out that his hybrid form is consistent with that of other gods.587

According to Guo Pu, they are the same as the Three-Sprouts People [see nos. 71, 218, 313] allied with Huantou, whose land is recorded in chapter 6; however, there they are located in the distant south, where they were banished for rebelling against the Yellow Thearch.

A ruler who can encounter Yanwei and sacrifice food to him will dominate the world.601 Yanwei is a god who dwells beyond the Sprouts-People [no. 335], according to the text, and may be their ancestral spirit. Guo Pu considered him identical to a demon of the lake known as Wei-Snake mentioned in a fable in the “Mastering Life” chapter of the Master Zhuang. There WeiSnake is described as the god of a large lake who is as large as a wheel hub and as long as a carriage shaft and wears a purple robe and a vermillion hat. He detests the sounds of thunder and of carriages, sounds that cause him to stand up and raise his head(s). One day, Duke Huan of Qi sees a demon while hunting in a marsh and falls ill. He recovers when he realizes that he has seen Wei-Snake, and it is explained to him that this means he will become ruler over the other feudal states. Yuan Ke cited the hypothesis of Wen Yiduo that the Yanwei/Wei-Snake figure evolved into the Fuxi and Nüwa motif in Han painting and was the ancestral spirit of the Sprouts Tribe.602

He was thus able to define the Nine Provinces.607 This final passage in the text pays tribute to Yu the Great, founder of the Xia Dynasty. According to several myths, Yu was born from the belly of Gun three years after Gun was executed at Feather Mountain. The latter was also said to have transformed into a yellow bear or a yellow dragon. Liu Xin in his preface stated that:
Yu spent four years notching trees along the mountains as he fixed the courses of the great rivers by the tall mountains. Yi and Boyi were in charge of driving out the birds and beasts, naming the mountains and rivers, classifying the plants and trees, and distinguishing the features of watery bodies and land masses. The Four Marchmounts assisted them as they traveled throughout the four directions to where men seldom venture on foot and boats and carriages rarely reach. Within, they distinguished the mountains of the five directions and beyond, they identified the seas in the eight directions. They recorded rare treasures and extraordinary objects, things living in foreign places, the locations on land and sea of plants and trees, birds and beasts, insects, Lin-Beasts and Feng-Birds [nos. 271, 330], wherever auspicious omens hide themselves, and, beyond the Four Seas, the lands in far-o regions and the strange peoples there. Yu defined the Nine Provinces and determined which products were to be submitted as tribute. Yi and the others classified things into beneficial and harmful, writing down the Guideways through Mountains and Seas as a record of matters pertaining to sages and worthies, all clearly set down in ancient graphs.
In this final illustration, Yu the Great appears in the upper right inspecting workers who are cutting a channel to drain the floodwaters. To the left is an o‹cial holding a sword, probably either Yi or Boyi, though neither appears in the text of the Guideways. Like plate I, this plate was also eliminated from later editions.608

Notes
Introduction
1. The Guideways through Mountains and Seas s ̧g has been commonly translated as the Classic of Mountains and Seas, which assumes that the graph jing g in the title means “classic.” However, it was never canonized by any early intellectual or religious tradition, and most bibliographers classified it as either a geographical work or later as a collection of fictionalized “minor narratives” pK. In the sixteenth century, the commentator Wang Chongqing  ̋Ry (1484–1565) argued that the graph jing in the title is better understood as “route” or, as I have translated, “guideway.” Recently, this translation has been further elaborated by the modern commentator Yuan Ke K» (1916–) based on internal evidence and the predominant use of the term in other early Chinese texts. See Y181–83; F4. The origin of the Chinese title Shanhaijing remains unknown. The first mention of an early form of the text in Sima Qian’s q®E (c. 145–c. 86 b.c.e.) Historical Records vO (c. 90 b.c.e.) included jing in the title (see Shiji [1975 ed.] 10:3179); significantly, he did not use this graph elsewhere when referring to Confucian texts already canonized as “classics.” While jing meaning “book” appears as early as the Master Mo •l (c. late 5th–3rd cent. b.c.e.), especially after the canonization of the Confucian classics in the Western Han, it became fashionable to append jing meaning “classic” or “book” to a variety of texts for which special claims of authority were made. Thus, in the minds of later Chinese editors and readers, it was more natural to interpret the graph as “classic,” an assumption reinforced by the antiquity of the text. It is also worth noting that, following the Guideways, other texts were compiled based on geographical routes that also employed jing in the title such as the Guide to Waterways Ùg (Han–Three Kingdoms) and the Guideways to Gods and Anomalies  ́ßg (late Han–4th cent. c.e.). The former was later expanded by Li Daoyuan ∞D∏ (d. 527) into the monumental Guide to Waterways with Commentary Ùg` (early 6th cent.), often similarly translated as the Water Classic. For a further discussion of jing as originally meaning “something running throughout an area and serving to define or regulate it,” see Lewis (1999), 297–302. 2. Guanzi 51 (Zzjc ed., 5:276). For a brief discussion of the hegemonic career of the historical Duke Huan and the role of Guan Zhong, see Hsu (1999), 553–57. 3. Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 220. The commentator Guo Pu (276–324) later defined the use of guai in the Guideways as follows: “Whenever the term ‘guai’ appears, it always denotes that which is bizarre, unique, and out of the ordinary in appearance” (H1:2a). 4. See Shizi 2:3b (Sbby ed.). A number of legends about King Yan of Xu }≥E circulated through the centuries, and some still survive in modern Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. The king was evidently a bit of a strange creature himself, for he was said to have had eyes that could not look down and his body was said to contain muscle but no bones. According to historical sources, he ruled the state of Xu in the northwest of modern Jiangsu during the time of King Mu of the Western Zhou (r. 956–918 b.c.e.) and formed a confederation of thirty-six other states that stretched from modern Hubei in the area later considered within the state of Chu to modern Shandong, where the Eastern Yi-Barbarians Fi predominated. This alliance threatened the royal
229



Zhou capital in 942 b.c.e. and forced King Mu to recognize King Yan’s influence. Since both Xu and the confederation were regarded as eastern barbarians di erent from the Huaxia ÿL peoples of the Central Plains area, the legends associating him with strange creatures and suggesting that he was one himself may reflect this ethnic bias. Other legends preserved in the later anomaly account Record of Manifold Curiosities ’ ́” (3rd cent.) state that he was born from an egg that was rescued by a dog and that he was a humane ruler who fled with thousands of his people rather than defend himself against Chu, which King Mu had ordered to attack him. However, according to another tradition, he was said to have reigned in the seventh century b.c.e. For a historical account of him, see Shaughnessy (1999), 323–25. For various legends, see Yuan, ed., Zhongguo shenhua chuanshuo cidian (1985), 322–23; also B125–27. 5. See Lunyu 7 (Ssjzs ed., 2:2483): “The Master did not speak of strange phenomena, the use of force, rebellions, or the gods.” Like their counterparts in ancient Greece, some of the important Chinese philosophers and historians were critical of mythology and popular religious beliefs, while others, particularly the school of Mo Di •C (c. 479–381 b.c.e.), advocated continued reverence for gods and demons. Even the early Confucians, however, promoted ritual sacrifices, sacred dances, divination, and elaborate funerals. Confucius was also quoted as urging his students to “demonstrate respect for demons and gods so as to keep them at a distance” (Lunyu 6 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2479]) as an intelligent means of governing the people. 6. See the comprehensive reinterpretation of ancient Chinese religion in Poo (1998), which argues that the conventional distinction between “o‹cial” and “popular” is less useful than recognizing a broader “personal religion” in which most believers regardless of status or ideology were motivated by concerns of personal welfare. Pages 92–101 specifically look at the Guideways in terms of its reflections of popular beliefs. 7. See, for example, the story dated 541 b.c.e. about an illness of Duke Ping of Jin ?≠Ω (r. 557–32 b.c.e.) in Zuo’s Narratives to the Spring and Autumn Annals KÓTM« (c. late 4th cent. b.c.e.). A diviner identifies the demonic cause as the gods Shichen ÍH and Taitai OŒ, but neither he nor the court scribe-astrologer can provide any further information about their identities. Finally, a visiting aristocrat, Zichan of Zheng Gl£ (fl. mid-6th cent. b.c.e.), is able to o er details of their genealogies and characters. This not only reveals the professional cooperation between spirit-mediums and o‹cials in identifying strange creatures but also the di‹culty that both had in this case in providing information about two local gods (Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi: Zhaogong 1 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2023–24]; translated in Legge [1966 ed.] 5:580). 8.

of better data. Regarding Yu the Great, his historical existence and that of the Xia dynasty remain controversial and are as yet unconfirmed by indisputable archaeological evidence. Some modern scholars would identify the Erlitou period and the area around modern Luoyang, Henan, as a plausible time and place for the Xia. There is, however, a wealth of mythology about him, and the traditional Chinese historical view regarded him as a sage ruler. The Bamboo Annals notes that he was actually in power for forty-five years, although during most of these, his predecessor Shun was alive. Hence, his own reign as first emperor of the Xia is only counted as eight years. For translations of various myths about Yu, see B9 passim (Zhushu jinian 1 [Sbck ed., 1:10–11]; Legge 3:117–18). 23. Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi: Xuangong 3 (Ssjzs ed., 2:1868). All translations are mine unless otherwise noted. For other translations, see Legge (1966 ed.) 5:293, Watson (1989), 82, and B153–55. This passage is also discussed in Jiang (1934), 6–12 and Campany (1996), 102–4. 24. The myth of Yu’s Nine Bronze Vessels as it evolved through the Han dynasty has been studied in Tang (1979), while a further interpretation is presented in Chang (1983), 95–101. For a recent view of the vessels as symbolic of the monumental impulse in early Chinese art, see Wu (1995), 4–15. 25. For the earliest extant statement of this view, see the preface by the Han dynasty court bibliographer Liu Xin (Xiu) Bı(q, 46 b.c.e.–23 c.e.) in 6 b.c.e., “Memorial upon Submitting the Guideways through Mountains and Seas” Ws ̧gÌ:
The Guideways through Mountains and Seas appeared during the time of the thearchs Yao Û [trad. r. 2145–2046 b.c.e] and Shun œ [trad. r. 2042–1993 b.c.e.]. In antiquity, the floodwaters of the Deluge inundated China and the common people lost their homes, fleeing to inaccessible corners of hills and mountains or building nest-like dwellings in trees. Gun X failed to accomplish his mission of curbing the floods so the thearch Yao appointed Yu the Great to succeed him. Yu spent four years notching trees through the mountains and determining the locations of the high mountains and the courses of the great rivers. Yi q and Boyi Bk were responsible for clearing out the birds and beasts, naming the mountains and rivers, classifying the plants and trees, and distinguishing the salient features of the watery bodies and the landforms. The four sacred peaks aided them as they circulated through the four directions to places where men, boats, and carriages rarely reach. In the inner regions, they distinguished the mountains in the five directions while in the outer regions, they di erentiated the seas of the eight directions. They recorded the treasures and rare objects, the products of these strange places as well as where plants, trees, birds, beasts, insects, fish, and Feng-Birds are found on land and water together with hidden omens and strange tribes dwelling in distant lands beyond the four seas. Yu the Great defined the nine provinces and obtained tribute from each territory while Yi and the others classified these things according to whether they were beneficial or harmful, compiling the Guideways through Mountains and Seas (H:Xulu:1ab).
The original text has been reprinted in Y477–78 and also translated in Eitel (1888) and in S383–85. In addition to an explicit statement attributed to Yu about his travels recorded in the Master Guan and interpolated at the end of chapter 5 (H5:53b–54a); see no. 214. Another reference to Yu in the “Seeking Out People” chapter of The Compendium of Mr. Lü fÛKÓRDHg (c. 239 b.c.e.) also seems especially to connect him with the content of the Guideways. This passage notes his travels to the lands of various foreign tribes, each of which is also recorded in the Guideways. This fact would suggest that Yu was already considered the author of the Guideways in the late Warring States period. The association of Yu the Great with other cosmographies can be seen from a fragment of a pre-Qin text, the Basic Annals of Yu Íaˆ cited in Sima Qian’s Historial Records. This text contains a description of Mount Kunlun similar to the format of the Guideways and is briefly discussed in Campany (1996), 36–37 (Guanzi 77 [Zzjc ed., 5:382]; Lüshi chunqiu 22 [Zzjc ed., 6:292]). 26. For a study of the Paces of Yu ÍB, which is still performed by Daoist priests today, see Andersen (1989–1990); also Granet (1925). Harper (1999), 872–73, discusses the “Promptuary of Yu” Í∑ÿ among the Shuihudi ŒÍa almanacs buried in Yunmeng, Hubei, c. 217 b.c.e. that includes a ritual performed before traveling outside a city. He also notes that the Paces of Yu was
NOTES TO PAGES 4–5 231



employed for both traveling and medical exorcism and assumes that by this time the elite were also capable of performing these occult rituals. 27. Lu Xun |≥ (1881–1936), then a professor of Chinese literature at Beijing University, was one of the first modern scholars to recognize the value of the Guideways as a source of mythology in his lectures later published in 1923 as A Brief History of Chinese Fiction §Íp°v§, although his view that it constituted the origins of Chinese fiction has been largely abandoned. Yuan Ke’s arguments on the general origins of the text and the special role traditionally ascribed to Yu the Great are persuasive, although some of his specific comments on pp. 238–40 concerning the supposed evolution of the text from Yu’s Nine Bronze Vessels are less so. See Lu (1973 ed.), chap. 2; Yuan (1986). 28. For discussions of the recently discovered daybooks, most of which date from the late third century b.c.e., see Harper (1985, 1997, 1999); also Poo (1998), 69–92. 29. The term “wu-shaman” ≈ is used here advisedly for want of a more accurate designation of an unorganized class of spirit-mediums that long existed in almost every traditional Chinese community and whose practices reflected considerable local variations. These shamans generally gained their status either through inheritance or by demonstrating personal charisma, and scattered exponents of these techniques can still be found today. More than a millennium after the Shang, the dictionary Explanations and Analyses of Graphs °Â—r (100 c.e.) glossed wu as zhu  ̈ or “priest-invocator,” a temple ritual o‹cial who in other texts is distinguished from the wushamans in status and function. It also considered wu a derivation of a homophonic pictograph wu R (“dance”), said to represent the fluttering sleeves of female shamans as they danced to invoke the gods to descend. The lexicographer Xu Shen \V (c. 55–c. 149 c.e.) here followed the distinction of wu as female and xi D as male found in the Conversations from the Feudal States Íy (late 5th–4th cent. b.c.e.). He also paraphrased the Conversations by defining xi as “those who are capable of maintaining a reverential attitude in serving the gods.” Later, the commentator Xu Kai }“ (920–974) added that xi was written with the radical jian/xian £ (“to see/manifest”), because they were capable of seeing or manifesting these gods. In most Chinese texts, however, wu has usually referred generically to shamans of both sexes. See Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 100. For a discussion of wu-shamans recorded in the Guideways, see below under “The Typology of the Strange: Wu-shamans,” 51–53. 30. Guoyu 18: Chuyu 2 (1978 ed., 2:559–60). For an interpretation of this passage as indicating the central role of shamanism in early Chinese politics, see Chang (1983), 44–45. 31. In the modern period, a number of Chinese scholars, notably Chen, “Shangdai” (1936), and Chang (1981, 1983) have espoused the view that the wu were shamans who, with the aid of strange creatures, ascended to heaven to communicate with gods and who also engaged in other ecstatic practices on earth, especially those involving song and dance. However, other scholars, principally Keightley (1983) have pointed out the di erences between the wu as recorded in lateShang-dynasty oracle-bone inscriptions and the Central and Northern Asian shamans studied by Mircea Eliade in Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Princeton, 1964), in which he considered ecstatic communication their definitive characteristic. More recently, Keightley (1995, 133) has suggested that the practices of the wu could be regarded as “shamanism with Chinese characteristics,” while noting that much work needs to be done to identify these characteristics, particularly for the Neolithic and Shang periods. More evidence is available from the Eastern Zhou dynasty, however, especially from the Guideways itself, providing a broader indication of the range of the activities of the wu. This suggests that they may not have been fundamentally di erent from their cultural neighbors. Another view advanced by Mair (1990) based on archaeological and linguistic evidence argues that some of the wu of the Shang and Western Zhou periods were nonChinese “europoids” and that the Archaic Sinitic pronounciation, “*myag,” is connected to the Ancient Persian “magu1,” indicating a class of “magicians” found across the Eurasian continent. For some representative studies of wu-shamans, see Chan (1972), Chang (1976, 1981, 1983), Chen (1936), Chow (1978), de Groot (1892–1910) 6:2:1187–1242, Hayashi (1967, 1972), Hu (1956), Keightley (1983, 1989, 1995), Liang (1989), Schafer (1951), Von Falkenhausen (1995), and Zhou (1979). The role of ecstatic practitioners throughout the history of Chinese popular religion has also been explored in Paper (1995). The relationship between wu-shamans and the Guideways is specifically considered in Cheng (1943), Yuan Ke (1986), and Yuan Xingpei (1979). For surveys of the current
232 NOTES TO PAGES 5–7



state of the field of early Chinese religion, see the various essays on each period in Overmeyer et al. (1995). For the role of shamans in late Chu religion, see Major (1999), 135–39. 32. The process whereby intellectuals during the Warring States, Qin, and Han periods constructed new forms of political authority through written texts has been extensively studied in Lewis (1999). 33. Guan Yifu, in his response to King Zhao of Chu, also discussed the government establishment in charge of sacred a airs in antiquity and subordinated xi- and wu-shamans to higher ritual o‹cials, ranking them below zhu-priests  ̈ in charge of ceremonial a airs, zong-scribes v in charge of textual matters such as genealogy, and, finally, the Five Administrators ≠x. However, this system probably reflects a Warring States ideal proposed by intellectuals that for rhetorical purposes was transferred back into mythological time, though perhaps with some basis in historical reality. Guan also suggested that this earlier political structure weakened when highranking families began to sacrifice to and invoke the higher gods on their own. The tension between these superior ritual o‹cials and wu-shamans can be seen in an incident recorded in the “Understanding Demons” chapter of the Master Mo •lR ̇≠ (late 5th to late 3rd cent. b.c.e.). During the time of Duke Wen of Song ∫ÂΩ (r. 610–589 b.c.e.), Guangu [d, identified by commentators as a zhu-priest at the state ancestral temple, was murdered by a figure identified as a wu-shaman who was enraged at Guangu’s failure to follow the proper form in ritual sacrifices. The text clearly implies that the shaman was possessed and speaking righteously on behalf of the gods, while the o‹cial is portrayed as arrogant and heedless of the interests of the duke, then still a child. See Mozi jiangu 31 (Zzjc ed., 4:143); translated in Watson (1963), 98. Another source indicating the superior position of higher ritual o‹cials over wu-shamans is the Government Organization of the Zhou Dynasty Pß (late Warring States period). Though presenting an idealized view of the early Zhou central government, it probably reflects a certain view of wu current during the late Warring States period. The text di erentiates between wu and higher ritual o‹cials whose ranks are based on hereditary privilege. The majority of wu employed in the Ministry of Rites Kx are only ad hoc appointments and overseen by non-wu administrators in the Division of Priests j ̈ headed by someone of the Lower Magnate Uj“ rank. Although the text stipulates that a few of the most educated and e‹cacious wu may become ennobled, most remain outside the normal bureaucratic system. They perform at certain public functions such as sacrifices to the gods of mountains and rivers, the annual Great Exorcism j¿, anointments, healing rituals, funerals, and prayers to relieve droughts and other calamities, carrying out their primary function of communicating with the gods by going into shamanistic trances. See Von Falkenhausen (1995). During the Han, the political position of the wu continued to deteriorate under pressure from the Confucian o‹cials until by the latter part of the Eastern Han dynasty, wu were proscribed from taking the o‹cial examinations. For a study of the final political decline of the wu under the Han, see Lin (1989). 34. For an essay on early Chinese philosophical attitudes toward gods and demons, see Qian (1955). The development of the theory of the ethereal and earthly souls is also described in Yu (1964–1965; 1981). 35. For discussions of what some Western scholars have called “reverse euhemerism,” that is, the transformation of mythological gods into historical personages in Chinese historiography, see B13–20, Bodde (1961), Boltz (1981), Chang (1976), and Maspero (1924). 36. For discussions of the rise of “correlative” cosmologies or correspondence systems among certain philosophical schools in the Warring States period, see Graham (1986), Henderson (1984), esp. 1–58, and Sivin (1995). Their application to certain early religious pantheons is discussed in Riegel (1989–1990). Although one can trace the origin of these views to the late Warring States period, it was only from the Qin-Han period onward that they were more fully articulated and widely promoted to support the authority of the centralized imperial state. 37. Like the wu-shamans, the fangshi-wizards were increasingly opposed by the Confucians and other members of the bureaucracy and lost most of their prestige among the elite by the end of the Eastern Han. They practically disappeared as a distinct group by the fourth century c.e., although some of their knowledge, particularly alchemy and the cult of the Transcendents P, was absorbed into religious Daoism. A survey of the fangshi-wizards, along with biographies of some of them from the early dynastic histories, is presented in DeWoskin (1983).

38. The bifurcation of medical treatment into wu-shaman and the more prestigious yiphysician Â medicine can be seen in the historian Sima Qian’s biography of the Warring States physician Bian Que ÛN (fl. c. 501 b.c.e.), who served various rulers and actively opposed shamanistic methods, although such an early date may be anachronistic. See Shiji (1975 ed.) 9:2785–794. 39. For an analysis of the patterns of social mobility during the Eastern Zhou period, see Hsu (1965). The e ect on religious practice of the devolution of central Zhou authority is discussed in Bilsky (1975) 1:159–90. The feudal states increasingly developed religious autonomy from the state cult as local rulers directly worshiped heaven, usurping clans appropriated more powerful gods as ancestors, and the pantheons of conquered neighbors were annexed or eliminated. Among the consequences of these shifts were the continuous revision of earlier myths and the creation of new divine genealogies. The competition against popular religion and the wu-shamans by the Celestial Masters school is discussed in Robinet (1997), 62–65. 40. For a discussion of the role of these texts during what he has called the “encyclopedic epoch,” see Lewis (1999), 287–336. Lewis extends this process of encyclopedic compilation to include Sima Xiangru’s q®¤p (c. 179–117 b.c.e.) fu-rhapsodies ·, Sima Qian’s Historical Records, and the bibliographical projects of Liu Xiang BV (c. 79–c. 8 b.c.e.) and his son Liu Xin. 41. Despite the abundance of examples of this genre that once existed, the “Tributes of Yu” Í^ (late Warring States) is the only other cosmography to have survived before the Han dynasty. It is a short text only 1,200 graphs in length containing elements of fabrication and purports to describe the world order established by Yu the Great. It was later incorporated as a chapter of the canonical Documents of Antiquity |— (Zhou dynasty), in which it was traditionally read as an accurate historical record. Long revered as China’s oldest geography, it describes Yu’s itinerary in curbing the Deluge and then his division of the world into nine provinces and five dependencies, listing mountains, trading routes, and products submitted as tribute to the central Chinese court. Modern scholars now consider it either slightly earlier or later than the Guideways, though some believe it to be as late as the Qin dynasty. Far from being an accurate historical and geographical record, much of it is probably a fabrication by the Ru-Confucian school designed to support their mythology of the golden age of the sage-kings. By comparison, the Guideways, containing more than thirty thousand graphs, is a far more extensive and eclectic work whose earlier strata are probably much older. For a summary of six di erent views of the date of its authorship, see Yu (1990), 37–40 and for other views Li (1982) and Wang (1982), 4–13. For an annotated reading of the text by the modern historian Gu Jiegang, see Gu ed. (1959), 1–55. An English translation appears in Karlgren (1950), 12–18. It is significant that the Guideways, the “Tributes,” and the Basic Annals of Yu were all connected with Yu the Great. See Shiji (1975 ed.) 10:3179. For an astronomical and cosmological interpretation of the myths associated with Yu, see Porter (1996), 27–56. 42. For a discussion of the generic characteristics of the cosmography and its relationship to the later genre of anomaly accounts ”« in early medieval China, see Campany (1996), 1–17. 43. See Harbsmeier (1985), 298, who characterized the Chinese worldview as follows: “The spatializing e ectivity of the sino-centric social cosmology consisted in transforming such dangerous temptations to go back to other times into movements away from the center such that distance and direction in space seen from the center alone appear as the only possible coordinates of movement.” 44. In the “Measurements of the Earth” chapter in the Master Guan filRa∆, Guan Zhong, in reply to Duke Huan of Qi’s question about the extent of the earth, emphasizes the importance of the ruler identifying and taking control of special mountains that are discovered to contain “manifest e ulgences” £a, principally metals for military use. Such materials were regarded as divinely present and necessitating sacrifices to the resident gods and severe punishments against unauthorized venturing onto the mountain.

49. Wang Yi’s  ̋h (c. 89–c. 158 c.e.) opinion has been regarded by some scholars as having implications for the origins of the Guideways as well. Most scholars now doubt the traditional attribution to Qu Yuan }Ï (c. 339–c. 278 b.c.e.) and Song Yu ∫... (c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.) of the poems in the Songs of Chu anthology that seems to have arisen in the Han dynasty. The major extant edition of the songs with commentaries was edited by the Song scholar Hong Xingzu x≥TM (1090–1155) as The Songs of Chu with Additional Commentaries °„...` (first half of 12th cent.). For a complete translation of the anthology, see Hawkes (1962). For translations of “The Nine Songs” Eq, see Waley (1955). For a recent translation of the “Questions of Heaven” —›, see Ch’ü Y’üan (1986). For studies of this poem, see Field (1992), who relates the structure of the poem to cosmographs and reads it as an intellectual questioning of certain religious and historical views; also Xiao (1991), 763–996, who considers the role of murals in the genesis of the poem on pp. 844–79. The “Questions of Heaven” and the Guideways have been compared in Fu (1969). Wang Yi’s opinion about the murals appears in Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 85. 50. For representative arguments supporting a Chu origin for the Guideways, see Meng Wentong (1962) and Yuan Ke (1978). For recent essays on aspects of Chu culture, see Cook and Major, eds. (1999). The geographical expansion and political history of Chu is surveyed in Blakeley (1999). 51. In his postscript comment on his account of Zhang Qian’s mission to Central Asia, Sima Qian criticized the Basic Annals of Yu and the Guideways while praising the geography in the Documents Classic, by which he probably meant the “Tributes of Yu.” This skepticism reflects his more rationalistic approach to source material as well as his own experience as a widely traveled youth and o‹cial. It may also be a critique of Emperor Wu, who was particularly fond of works about strange creatures and supported expeditions of fangshi-wizards, who catered to his yearning for the secret of longevity. See Shiji (1975 ed.) 10:3179. 52. For discussions of how criteria of factuality and verisimilitude influenced the development of traditional Chinese narrative, especially the genres of anomaly accounts, historical biography, and fiction, see Campany (1991, 1996), Lu (1993), and Porter (1996). 53. For studies of omenology in the Han, see Bielenstein (1984), Powers (1983), Powers (1991), 192 passim, and Wu (1989), 76–85. 54. Liu Xiang’s work Biographies of Various Transcendents CP« (1st cent. b.c.e.) follows the model of Sima Qian’s biographies, while espousing the beliefs of the fangshi-wizards and early Daoists. It has been translated in Kaltenmark (1953). Some scholars have questioned Liu Xiang’s authorship, however. See Campany (1996), 40–41, for a brief discussion of the text. 55. Liu Xin, “Memorial upon Submitting the Guideways through Mountains and Seas” (H:Xulu:1b; Y477–78). The information in the extant version does not exactly conform to the figure, which Liu Xiang identified as the Minister of Erfu, suggesting that the information in the Guideways was loosely interpreted in the past or that the text itself was subsequently altered. 56. Liu Xin, “Memorial” (H:Xulu:1b; Y477). 57. Liu Xin, “Memorial” (H:Xulu:1b; Y477). Liu Xin submitted his version of the Guideways shortly before he was briefly forced to leave the court owing in part to partisan opposition to the “Ancient-Text School.” For a discussion of the role of the Liu family in restoring a “universal library,” see Lewis (1999), 325–32. 58. In addition to his preface, Liu Xin left two colophons announcing the completion of his editorial work at the end of chapters 9 and 13 in the present version. That he did so would suggest that his edition stopped here, although he stated in the preface that he had taken thirty-two chapters and reorganized them into eighteen. Guo Pu’s edition, however, contains eighteen chapters but includes an additional group, the present chapters 14 to 18. This disparity creates one of the many di‹culties of defining Liu’s exact editorial role that textual scholars have since tried to solve though so far without conclusive results. 59. Wang, Lunheng: Bietong (Zzjc ed., 7:133). 60. Houhanshu (1965 ed.) 9:2465. 61. See the discussion in Huang (1994), 8, which argues that the work listed in the “Techniques and Calculations” section is another text entirely di erent from Liu Xin’s version of the Guideways as well as the views of Yuan Xingpei (1979) and Suh (1993), 24. 62. Hanshu (1975 ed.) 3:1774–775. 63. Guo Pu’s edition continues to be the basic one followed by all subsequent commentators.

However, later counts of graphs in individual chapters and other quantitative information indicates that there have been minor additions and deletions to the text since Guo Pu’s time. Among later printed editions, there are also variations in the graphs themselves as well as in syntax. There is no single urtext, and modern readers have primarily followed the commentary editions of Hao Yixing (1809) and Yuan Ke (1980). 64. For translations of some of these works, see Kan (1996) (Soushenji), Graham (1960) (Liezi), Legge (1966) (Zhushu jinian), Mathieu (1978) (Mutianzi zhuan), Watson (1968) (Zhuangzi). 65. Translated in Ware (1966), 279–80. 66. Guo Pu ¢\ (276–324), courtesy name Jingchun ∫¬, was born in Wenxi, Hedong, in modern Shaanxi province and emigrated to the southeast to avoid the civil war, which led to the collapse of the Western Jin dynasty. He served the succeeding Eastern Jin dynasty under several local commanders as an administrator and as secretarial court gentleman under Emperor Yuan ∏“ (r. 317–322). He was later executed by one of his patrons, General-in-Chief Wang Dun  ̋∞ (266–324), when he prognosticated Wang’s failure if he rebelled. He also achieved note for his poetry, some of which, like “Roaming the Realm of Transcendents” ÂP÷ and “Rhapsody on the Long River” ø·, included strange creatures. Guo annotated the Songs of Chu, the glossary Approaching Refinement ∏Æ (c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.) to which he also added a set of encomiums, and The Chronicle of King Mu p—l« (Warring States–Six Dynasties) as well as the poetry of Sima Xiangru. Among his friends was Gan Bao z_ (fl. first half of 4th cent.), compiler of Collected Accounts in Search of Spirits j ́O. In addition to his o‹cial biography in the History of the Jin Dynasty ?— (644–646), Guo was later considered to have been a Transcendent himself and was mythologized in various Daoist religious texts. For a short biography of Guo, see Pease (1998). For a discussion of Guo and the Guideways, see Yuan (1979), 19–21. 67. Guo Pu, “Zhu Shanhaijing xu” `s ̧g‘ (H:Xulu:2a; Y478) Translated into English in S387–400; also Eitel (1881), 331–34. The Chinese text has also been reprinted in Y478–80. 68. The Encomiums s ̧gœŸ (c. 320) celebrate not only strange creatures but also important places, trees, plants, and minerals. It began to be mentioned in the bibliography sections of the Sui and Tang dynastic histories and was also included in Guo Pu’s collected works. However, the set of illustrations to which it was originally appended disappeared. Many of the later printed editions of the Guideways with Guo Pu’s commentary included the Encomiums based on the Ming Daoist Canon D√ version of c. 1444–45. In particular, the Qing commentator Hao Yixing used this text as a basis for his corrected series, which he appended to the main text in his 1809 edition. Translations of these appear in S265–381. The Encomiums were also used as captions in some of the later series of portraits popular during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries based on those in the 1667 Wu Renchen dÙ⁄ edition. However, not all the 265 poems in Hao Yixing’s edition match the extant portrait illustrations, and it is believed that there were originally more poems. A few additional ones have been preserved within Guo’s commentary to the text. Another series of 303 poems was transcribed during the Yuan dynasty by Cao Zhongliang ‰Ú} (n.d.). This series was recently discovered a few decades ago preserved in the Palace Museum, Beijing, and was published in Shanghai in 1958. It had passed through the hands of late Ming scholars such as Chen Jiru Ø~ß (1558–1639) and the painter-calligrapher Dong Qichang ≥‰ ̃ (1555–1636) and may transmit a Song version of the text. This set was apparently not seen by Hao Yixing and contains a number of variations from his version. At least two other scholars, Lu Wenchao cÂp (1717–1795) and Yan Kejun (1762–1843) Yi°, collected a similar number of poems, some from other sources. In addition, there was another set of encomiums slightly later than Guo Pu’s by Zhang Jun i@ (310–346), which has not survived. See Guo (1958) and Zhu (1998). 69. H:tuzan œŸ:13b. 70. The scholar and aesthetic theorist Zong Bing v± (375–443) advocated the use of landscape paintings as part of Daoist self-cultivation involving the viewer’s imagining of a journey of the spirit.

72. This image actually appeared a few decades earlier as a design for letter paper printed by the Ten Bamboo Studio QÀN (c. 1643) in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu. It was then titled, less appropriately, “Writing a Book” ¤— and is reproduced in Wood (1985), p. 7, with the full set of designs briefly discussed on p. 60. The Mustard Seed Garden Manual „lÈe« (1679) often reproduced earlier images and, in this case, altered the colophon to better suit the scholar’s pose of casual reading. 73. The continuing use of the Guideways is indicated by an anecdote in the o‹cial History of the Southern Dynasties nv (c. 629), which recorded an incident concerning Emperor Wu of the Liang ÁZ“ (r. 502–549) and a dozen recently acquired female attendants. To pacify the jealousy of the empress, his courtiers cited a passage in the Guideways (H3:18a) that supposedly recommends eating the flesh of the Canggeng-Bird ¡⁄. However, the extant text actually refers to this bird by an alternate name, Yellow-Bird ¿æ, thought by commentators to be an oriole. The anecdote was transmitted, especially among writers about jealousy, and was later satirized in a pseudo-biography of a Canggeng-Bird by the Ming scholar Yang Shen ®V (1488–1559), a later commentator on etymology in the Guideways. See Yenna Wu (1995), 79–81. 74. Suishu (1973 ed.) 4:982. The Four Libraries |° system (classics g, history v, philosophy l, and collected writings ∞) began to evolve during the Six Dynasties and was established as the standard categorization in the “Bibliographical Treatise” in the History of the Sui Dynasty ¶—Rgy” (656). The bibliographers here also noted an unconfirmed tradition that the early Western Han minister Xiao He ΩÛ (d. 193 b.c.e.) obtained a copy of the Guideways after gaining the maps of the fallen Qin dynasty from the captured imperial library. This kind of information was credited with his helping the military forces of Liu Bang Bπ (c. 256/247–195 b.c.e.) to defeat his rival Xiang Yu μ– (232–202 b.c.e.) and establish the Han dynasty. 75. For a summary of some Song views of the Guideways as the origin of local gazetteers, see Huang et al. (1993), 96–97. 76. You Mao’s ◊¿ (1127–1193) 1180 edition was printed by the Chiyangjunzhai ¿ßpN in modern Guichi, Anhui, and survives in only one copy now in the National Library of China, Beijing. It was reprinted in 1983 in a facsimile edition as the Guideways through Mountains and Seas with Commentary s ̧g«. See Shanhaijing zhuan (1983 reprint). You’s preface stated that in the course of thirty years he had investigated an old printed edition from the capital, the Song Daoist Canon edition, Liu Xin’s edition, and ten other versions. The earliest extant Daoist Canon edition is the Ming printing of 1444–45, which is without illustrations and also missing two chapters. For more on these versions, see Fracasso (1993), 363. 77.

79. The Songs of Chu continued to enjoy a high status in the Chinese poetic tradition. That the Guideways remained a valuable source of information for scholars can be seen in the quotations from it in Hong Xingzu’s edition, especially to illuminate passages in the “Questions of Heaven.” See Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 91. Hong also cited another work, The Illustrated Guideways through Mountains and Seas s ̧gœ, now lost. Zhu Xi∂Q (1130–1200), in his research on the Songs of Chu, mistakenly believed that the Guideways was based on the “Questions of Heaven.” See Ji et al., eds. (1971 ed.) 3:2939. 80. For a study of Zhu Xi’s attitude toward spiritual beings, see Gardiner (1995). The translated excerpt of his remarks is taken from Gardiner, 605–6, with minor changes by me. For a broad survey of Neo-Confucian attitudes toward gods and demons, see Qian (1955), 23–43. 81. For a study of the tradition of the Marvels of the East, which includes the principal manuscripts and books and a number of illustrations, see Wittkower (1942). For a reproduction of three medieval versions of the text, see James (1929). 82. Except for You Mao’s Southern Song edition of 1180, no other early edition has survived before the Ming.

Pu Songling’s ZQ÷ (1640–1715) collection, Strange Stories From a Chinese Studio ·N ”ß were written from 1679 to 1707 and published posthumously. Yuan Mei KT (1716–1798) authored two collections of stories of the strange entitled What Confucius Wouldn’t Discuss l£y (1788; later retitled New Tales from Qi Xie sÙ”). Ji Yun, who was critical of Pu’s eclectic literary style, authored his own collection as Random Notes from the Cottage of Close Observations \L ÛÛßO (1789–1798). For recent bibliographies of studies and translations of all three works, see the Indiana Companion to Traditional Chinese Literature (1998), 2: 270–72, 364–65, 488.
95. See Shanhaijing xinjiaozheng s ̧gs’ø(1781). In addition to his concern with geography, Bi’s commentary also focused on historical linguistics and issues of textual composition such as authorship, dating, and especially the various divisions into chapters. 96. Hao Yixing presented the following two sets of statistics. The first is from the encyclopedia Ocean of Jade ... ̧ (1266): number of graphs in text, 30,919; number of graphs in (Guo Pu’s) commentary, 20,350; total, 51,269. Hao Yixing’s own count in the early nineteenth century was: number of graphs in text, 30,825; number of graphs in (Guo Pu’s) commentary: 20,383; total, 51,208. The most recent count can be found in the ICS concordance, Shanhaijing zhuzisuoyin s ̧g vr¡fi (1994), 323: total number of graphs in text, 31,395. This latter version has undergone slight textual revision, however (H:Xulu:3b–5a). 97. So enduring was Hao Yixing’s edition that it was not until 1980 that another attempt at a complete and comprehensive commentary was published, that of Yuan Ke, which remains the only significant Chinese edition to date to use modern scholarship. In the period between these two, the only full-length studies worthy of note are the valiant but misguided e orts of Wu Chengzhi d”” (fl. early 20th cent.), whose Contemporary Explanations of the Geography of the Guideways through Mountains and Seas s ̧gazμ¿ (printed 1922) and the more recent but equally questionable Wei Tingsheng √oÕ and Xu Shengmo }t”, A Modern Geographical Study of Shanching with Maps sgazœ“ (1974). Both works again sought to identify the geographical locations of the mountains and rivers utilizing the traditional textual methods of Qing scholarship. 98. For an abridged translation of Li Ruzhen’s ıv√ (c. 1763–c. 1830) novel, see Li (1965). It is possible that Li was inspired by examples of contemporary Chinese maps of the world, which tended to represent foreign lands from the Guideways as island countries. For a study of the religious elements in the novel, see Chan (1989).
99. See the piece “Achang and the Guideways through Mountains and Seas”  ̧ ̄Os ̧g in Lu (1958) 2:226–31. Lu’s relationship with the Guideways is briefly discussed in Sun (1979). 100. Shen Yanbing H≠B (1896–1981), under the pen name Mao Dun Ÿfi, began writing on Chinese mythology in 1925. In 1929, he published under another alias, Xuanzhu »], Zhongguo shenhua yanjiu ABC §Í ́‹„s ABC (Studies in Chinese Mythology) in two volumes. This was the first important survey of Chinese myths to use comparative mythology and thematic classifications of material from the Guideways as well as other sources. In 1932, Zheng Dekun Gw[ (1908–1992) published an article on the Guideways that classified the myths according to disciplinary categories such as philosophy, science, history, and so on. The poet Wen Yiduo D@h (1899–1946), working during the 1930s and 1940s, studied such ancient texts as the Songs of Chu, the Book of Changes, and the Book of Songs. For a brief survey of modern Chinese and Japanese studies of Chinese mythology, see B13–17.

101. See note 27. 102. For a study of Gu Jiegang’s work in reevaluating the Chinese intellectual tradition, see Schneider (1971), especially chaps. 2 and 4. It is noteworthy that the work of the Han dynasty bibliographer and editor Liu Xin remerged as an issue among modern Chinese intellectuals, who either castigated him as a forger or gave him qualified recognition as the preserver of ancient texts. Gu fell into the latter camp. His views on Liu are summed up in Schneider, 244–51. 103. For some noteworthy articles on the Guideways in the “Tributes of Yu” Bimonthly Í^ bÎZ journal, see He Cijun (1934); Hou (1937); and Zhang (1934). The journal was coedited by the geographer Tan Qixiang ”‰≥ (1911–1992), who later published studies on the geographical locations of some of the places in the Guideways. 104. See Zhong (1931) and Ling et al. (1976 rpt.). The latter volume also contains an article by one of Gu Jiegang’s students in the Folkstudies Movement, Rong Zhaozu eFTM (1897–1994). 105. For important early-modern Chinese studies of the text, see Cheng (1933), He Guanzhou (1930), He Cijun (1934), Jiang (1934), Ling et al. (1934), Lu (1918), Wang (1934), Xuan (1929), Zhang (1934), Zheng (1933), and Zhong (1931). 106. For a review of Yuan Ke’s edition, see Mathieu (1983). 107. Among the more important Japanese scholarship are the studies of Itò (1969 .), Kiuchi (1985), Matsuda (1971 .), Mitarai (1984), Mori Mikisaburò (1944), Mori Yasutarò (1943), and Ogawa (1931). Among early European sinological studies are those of Bazin (1839), Eitel (1888), de Rosny (1891), de Harlez (1894) and de Mély (1897). The following complete translations have appeared in recent years: Kòma (1969) and Maeno (1975) (Japanese); Ianshinoi (1977) (Russian); Mathieu (1983) (French); Cheng et al. (1985), Birrell (1999) (English); Fracasso (1996) (Italian). For a review of Mathieu’s edition, see Casu (1988) and for Cheng et al., see Fracasso (1987). For detailed bibliographies on the Guideways arranged by subject, see Fracasso (1991), especially 366–67; also Suh (1993), 501–35. 108. The name Five Mountain-Treasuries ≠√s refers to the strings of major mountains located along the five directions in chapters 1–5. It apparently derives from a statement ascribed to Yu the Great, which was interpolated at some point at the end of chapter 5 (see no. 214). It quotes Yu as stating that he traveled to 5,370 notable mountains along a route of 64,056 li and that the major mountains are here recorded as the Five Mountain-Treasuries. Hao Yixing and some modern scholars felt that this statement may be dated to the Zhou-Qin or, more narrowly, to the Warring States period because of a similar statement in the “Measurements of the Earth” chapter of the Master Guan filGa∆. However, Mathieu believes that both passages were interpolated at a far later date (H5:53b–54ab; M372n10; F115n365; Y179–80, 183n2; C103; Guanzi 77 [Zzjc ed., 5:382]). 109. In Yuan Ke’s edition, chapters 14–18 as well as 6–13 are grouped together as the Guideways through Seas following the opinion of Bi Yuan. See Y183n2. 110. It is this group that commentators from Guo Pu on have believed were not originally part of Liu Xin’s edition. Although they contain many variations from the content of the other chapters, their content is not necessarily from a later date. They may have been submitted separatedly by Liu Xin to the imperial library and later included by Guo. Some scholars consider chapter 18 as separate in origin from chapters 14–17 (H14:la; Y337–38n1). 111. The count of graphs appears in Shanhaijing zhuzisuoyin (1994), 323. The number of passages appears in Suh (1993), 6. The eighteen chapters of Guo Pu’s edition are as follows:

112. The textual history of the Guideways has inspired a considerable amount of scholarship over the centuries and produced widely varying views about the dating and early organization of its content as well as slightly di erent graph counts. For a recent survey of the textual issues, including a chart of eleven main theories of the book’s date and place of composition, see Fracasso (1993), especially 359–61. A bibliography of articles on textual issues appears in Fracasso (1991), 87–89. 113. Yuan Ke (1983) listed ten common textual problems in the Guideways as follows: 1) wrong graphs; 2) missing graphs; 3) later interpolations; 4) reversed order of graphs; 5) incorporating the text within a commentary; 6) incorporating a commentary within the text; 7) lost lines or confused order of lines; 8) incorporation of other texts into the main text; 9) deliberately substituted graphs; 10) miscellaneous problems. 114. The Umbrella-Heaven \— theory, also known as the Gnomon of the Zhou dynasty Pπ theory, was traditionally credited to the ancient thearch Fuxi ÒTM and was said to have been later transmitted by the Duke of Zhou PΩ (r. 1042–1036 b.c.e.). It was particularly associated with the Zhou dynasty period and by the Eastern Han was discredited among o‹cial astronomers because of the inaccuracies of its calculations. In one of its later elaborations, earth, though still regarded as square, was seen as convex and highest at the northern extremity, the center of both heaven and earth. For summary discussions of the theory, see Needham (1959) 3:210–16; also Cullen (1993). 115. For this and other myths of Gonggong, see B97–98. It is also discussed in Major (1978), 6, as an astronomical myth enacted on the terrestial plane that describes the tilting of the ecliptic in relation to the celestial equator. See also Porter (1996), 31 passim. The Guideways only mentions the location of Cleft Mountain £Pßs in the west, not the accompanying myth itself, the earliest surviving version of which is in the “Patterns of Heaven” chapter of the Master of Huainan anlG—ÂV (c. 139 b.c.e.). See Huainanzi 3 (Zzjc ed., 7:35); H2:16a; Y40n1. 116. Various other mountains in the Guideways that may also relate to the concept of heavenly pillars are denoted by remarks in the text that they are “places where the ocean enters.” Among this group are “Lofty Celestial Terrace Mountain —OTMs” and “Celestial Co er at the Northern Extremity” _•—d. The most important mountain in the text that can be regarded as the axis mundi is clearly Mount Kunlun  ̄⁄ßC. See H15:5b, 17:4b; Y380n2. 117. Guo Pu commented that the phrase “nine divisions of heaven” (tian zhi jiubu —ßE°) meant “nine areas” ( jiubujie E°...) of heaven (H2:21b). 118. The Firm-Tree ÿÏ is mentioned in chapter 10 as resembling an ox with bark like cap strings or yellow snakes. Its leaves are like netting, its fruit is like that of the Luan-Tree ·, and its wood is like the Qiu-Tree _, which resembles the thorny elm. However, in chapter 18, it is described as having green leaves with purple veins, black blossoms, and yellow fruits. It is one hundred ren (approx. eight hundred feet) in height without any branches until the top, where there are nine that swirl upward, entangled, while below are nine huge roots. Its fruit is like hemp seed, and its leaves are like Mang-Grass ~ (Miscanthus sinensis). It was planted by the Yellow Thearch ¿“ and used by another thearch, Greater-Brilliance (Taihao) j∫ (both trad. r. c. 3rd millennium b.c.e.) to ascend and descend from heaven. The Master of Huainan later stated that it is used by all the thearchs to ascend and descend. For a discussion of mountains in the Guideways that are considered ladders to heaven, see Y450–52n13 (H10:4b–5a, 18:4b; B232–33; Huainanzi 4 [Zzjc ed., 7:57]). 119. The myth in which the divine o‹cials Chong  ́ and Li § are ordered by their grandfather, the thearch Zhuanxu Fz (trad. r. c. 3rd millennium b.c.e.), to sever the links between heaven and earth is briefly recorded in chapter 16. See H16:5b; Y403n7. It was elaborated in more detail in the course of Guan Yifu’s reply to King Zhao of Chu in the Conversations from the Feudal States mentioned above (see notes 30, 33). King Zhao had originally asked Guan the following: “When the Documents of Zhou [i.e., “The Prince of Lü on Punishments” chapter of the Doc
NOTES TO PAGES 29–30 241



uments of Antiquity |—GfD, early Spring and Autumn period] states that Chong and Li were ordered to sever the connection between Heaven and Earth, what does this mean? Had they not done so, does it mean that the common people would be able to ascend to Heaven?” After describing the proper administration of spiritual matters by wu-shamans and other ritual o‹cials in early antiquity, Guan went on to state:
During the decline of a airs under Lesser-Brilliance (Shaohao ÷∫, trad. r. c. 3rd millennium b.c.e.), the nine Li § brothers disrupted the cosmic powers. People and gods intermingled and could not be distinguished by their proper names. Ordinary people o ered up sacrifices and noble families took over the roles of wu-shamans and scribe-astrologer, acting without sincerity. The common people found it di‹cult to carry out sacrifices correctly so they were unable to obtain blessings. The winter sacrifice was not held at the appropriate time; people and gods occupied the same ritual positions. The people neglected their contractual obligations so there was no sense of respect or awe. Gods practiced the ways of men and behaved impurely. Life-giving sustenance was not bestowed from on high so there was nothing to o er up. Manifold disasters arrived and seemed endless. When Zhuanxu succeeded to the throne, he therefore commanded the Director of the South, Chong, to take charge of heaven and establish order among the gods. And he commanded the Director of Fire, Li, to establish order among the people. The old regulations were restored and these two groups no longer infringed upon one another. This is what is meant by the statement “to sever the connections between Heaven and Earth” (Guoyu 18: Chuyu 2 [1988 ed., 2:562–63]).

120. This passage also appears in the “Forms of the Earth” chapter of the Master of Huainan anlGPŒV. See Huainanzi 4 (Zzjc ed., 7:55); H6:1a; Y184. 121. This passage also appears in the “Measurements of Earth” chapter in the Master Guan, where it is spoken by Guan Zhong in response to Duke Huan of Qi’s inquiry about the extent of the world. It was believed by later commentators to be a Zhou dynasty interpolation. See Guanzi 77 (Zzjc ed., 5:382); H5:53b; Y180n8. 122. For a discussion of various geographical concepts of centrality during the Zhou dynasty, see Xiao (1996). For studies of the Luo River Diagram •— and its multivalent applications, see Cammann (1969) and Bergland (1990), and for an elaboration of magic squares in the Han as an expression of correlative cosmology, see Major (1976). Early Chinese textual sources for the Luo River diagram and its derivative, the Yellow River diagram eœ, are discussed in Bergland, 56–88. Among its many applications were Yu the Great’s Nine Provinces and versions of the Paces of Yu dance, which trace the diagram while reenacting Yu’s journey throughout the world to curb the Deluge. 123. The text of the “Tributes of Yu” does not specify the exact shape of the five dependencies, but it seems natural that they have been depicted as rectangles, given the general belief that the earth was unequally squared. This description apparently inspired some Han cartographers to also conceptualize Yu’s Nine Provinces as concentric squares. For a brief discussion of the Five Dependencies see Yee, “Chinese Maps in Political Culture” (1994), 76. Most Chinese, regardless of their education, continued to believe that the earth was flat well into the nineteenth century, despite the influence of Jesuit and other Western cartographers. For Chinese scholars’ resistance to Western depictions of a spherical world that was not Sinocentric, see Smith (1997), 7, 14–15. 124. See Hao Yixing’s commentary in H2:19a, which quotes various early sources to the e ect that in early China large bodies of water and those that lay beyond the borders were called “seas”  ̧. In the same passage, he noted that in the case of a river said to flow into the Eastern and Western Seas, the Eastern Sea in this case was probably a branch of the Western Sea and not the ocean in the east. 125.

For reproductions, see Needham (1959) 3:548; also Smith (1996), 27. These may derive from even earlier lost traditions of world maps by notable cartographers such as Pei Xiu pq (224–271) and Jia Dan Î‘ (730–805). There are numerous references in early texts to the use of maps by rulers, military figures, and emissaries during the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties. For surveys of the history of Chinese cartography, see Needham (1959); Smith (1996); and Yee (1994).

127. Also reproduced and briefly discussed in Smith (1996), 36. 128. Reproduced in Smith (1996), plates 12–14, and briefly discussed on p. 56. That many of the places selected from the Guideways are located elsewhere on these maps suggests that a divergent tradition arose among cartographers that was highly selective and was perpetuated among them without referring back to the original textual source. 129. In the Guideways only chapters 14–17 forming the third section follow the later sequence of east, south, west, and north. This fact may cast some light on the place of origin of these chapters or on the dates of their compilation and inclusion with the other sections. Among the arguments made by those who believe in a Chu authorship is the fact that most groups of chapters begin with the south and then proceed to the west. 130. The modern geographer Tan Qixiang ”‰≥ (1911–1992) reported the following conclusions on the measurements in seven individual guideways in the Guideways through Mountains: a) more than half the mountains mentioned can be identified today; b) the directions of the guideways are generally accurate with slight deviations; c) most distances between mountains are inaccurate, and the total distances at the end of each chapter are highly exaggerated; d) the most accurate statistics are for the areas covering modern southern Shanxi, central Shaanxi, and western Jiangxi. Unfortunately, Tan’s short report does not provide evidence of his methods, and his other conclusions about dating and authorship are unsupported. See Tan (1986), 13–14. In an earlier article (1978), Tan traced the course of the lower Yellow River and its tributaries in the third guideway through the Northern Mountains and asserted that this section of the Guideways represents the oldest description of the river’s course and probably predates the “Tributes of Yu.” Additional assessments of the geographical accuracy of these chapters appears in Wang (1982), 18–21, who concluded that the topographical information is hopelessly confused while arguing that the Guideways through Mountains nevertheless represents an advance in geographical thought and is thus later in date than the “Tributes of Yu.” He also observed that in general, those mountains whose names employ two graphs utilizing the formula “X s” were more verifiable, while the majority whose names contain four graphs using the formula “XX ßs” were fabricated. All studies to date that have sought to identify the places in the text remain largely hypothetical and unconvincing, since they are mostly based not on direct exploration but on correlations with other traditional texts. For a bibliography of such studies, see Fracasso (1991), 90–92. 131. The Five Marchmounts later became the principal sacred mountains located in each of the five directions. Special groupings first appear in such late Warring States texts as the glossary Approaching Refinement and the Government Organization of the Zhou Dynasty, though the number and identity of these peaks has varied somewhat over time. By the Han, the following grouping of five mountains was most common and has largely remained so through the later centuries: the Supreme Mountain (Taishan ıs) in the east, Transverse Mountain (Hengshan ≈s) in the south, Lotus Mountain (Huashan ÿs) in the west, Constancy Mountain (Hengshan Ìs) in the north, and Eminent Mountain (Songshan Cs) in the center. Before the Han, however, there were also other groupings of three, nine, and twelve sacred mountains. Still other groupings were promoted by the Buddhist and Daoist religions. For essays on the Five Marchmounts, see Robson (1995) and Wu (1993). A survey of sacred mountains in Chinese art is presented in Munakata (1991). 132. H2:1b–2a. 133. H4:3ab. Similarly, Mount Penglai ¥‹s [no. 294], one of the isles of the Transcendents in the Eastern Sea also promoted by the fangshi-wizards, is given a perfunctory entry in contrast to the elaborate description of Mount Kunlun. This is especially surprising, since some scholars have connected the authorship of the Guideways with the fangshi-wizards who were believed to have originated in this eastern area of China. 134. The scale for the central portion of the map has been estimated at between 1:80,000 and 1:100,000 and considered remarkably accurate. The original maps are reproduced and briefly discussed in Yee, “Reinterpreting Traditional Chinese Geographical Maps,” 40–46. For a bibliography of more detailed studies, see Yee, “Reinterpreting,” 41n13. Various studies and the reconstructed version of the map also appear in Guditu lunwenji (1975). 135. In only a few cases are any references made to political divisions, but these have sometimes been used to date the particular passage. For example, Yan Zhitui remarked that names such
NOTES TO PAGES 35–38 243



as Changsha  ̄F, Lingling sÆ, and Guiyang ¤ß were clearly later interpolations but still believed that the book was originally written by Yu the Great. Similarly, Hao Yixing pointed out that the system of commanderies p and districts § mentioned in some passages was of Zhou dynasty origin, though this also did not change his belief in the traditional authorship of the Guideways through Mountains, at least. See H: Xu ‘: 1b–2a. 136. See no. 202 and “Plates,” note 330. 137. Mount Kunlun has been widely believed to be a geographical place in the west or northwest, and even modern scholars have continued to search for its location. For myths of Mount Kunlun, see Yuan and Zhou eds. (1985), 83–90; also B183–85. An astrological interpretation of Mount Kunlun mythology is presented in Porter (1993). 138. H2:21b–23a. Some commentators and translators regard the Pin-Plant kÛ as a duckweed or mallow. 139. Although some believe the compilation of chapters 14–18 to be the latest in date, Yuan Ke argued that they contain some of the earliest material and dated them to no later than the middle Warring States period. See H14:1a; also Yuan (1978), 156–57. 140. H17:4a–5a; C185–86. 141. See, for example, the Yellow-Birds ¿æ [no. 308] and their imperial connection based on the homophony huang (Y367n2). 142. Y367n2. 143. For views of hybrid gods in China, see Chang (1981), Loewe (1978), and Fracasso (1983). 144. See He (1930), 1350–354. 145. For a recent consideration of composite construction in Chinese art, see Ledderose (1998). 146. See Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 27. The examples and terminology are taken from Boltz (1999), 118–23, where this is called “The Determinative Stage” in the development of the Chinese script. Boltz also hypothesizes the parallel process whereby various phonetic determinatives were added to a single semantic determinative, although this is admittedly less easy to document. 147. There are more than thirty creatures explicitly denoted as shen in the Guideways, although the total number that could be classified as such is greater. See Itò (1969, 1972, 1989) and Matsuda (1984, 1988) for comprehensive studies of these gods and strange creatures and Xu Xianzhi (1989), who views the gods as the totems of primitive tribes and local kinship groups. Thirty-five other studies on the religion, mythology, and divination in the Guideways are listed in Fracasso (1991), 93–98. For a collection of specific studies on individual gods that also interprets them anthropologically, see Mitarai (1984). 148. While scholars have generally regarded the Supreme God Di in Shang religion as referring to a single individual, Eno (1990) has argued persuasively that the term Di “ in Shang oraclebone inscriptions indicated a group of high royal ancestors, either individually or collectively. Furthermore, he maintains that the concept of Di as a single, supreme god only appears in Zhou texts. This may have been an adaptation of the Shang concept by the o‹cial Zhou dynasty religion, which originally regarded Tian — (Heaven) as its supreme god. 149. According to one theory recently proposed by Yuan Ke, the Supreme God Di in the Guideways has already been conflated with the Yellow Thearch. Thus, Yuan argues that in most cases when a figure is identified simply as Di, this should be read as signifying the Yellow Thearch. The concept of Di during the Zhou dynasty was not monolithic, though it seems to have been more anthropomorphic than that of the ancestral Zhou god, Tian (Heaven), who, at the hands of some philosophers and historians, evolved into a more impersonal cosmic force. See Y188n1. 150. Lesser-Brilliance was associated with avian imagery. In early mythology, he and his divine bureaucracy employed bird nomenclature in o‹cial titles and were probably represented as bird or hybrid bird forms. This was historicized in Zuo’s Commentary where, in an anecdote dated 525 b.c.e., a nobleman from the Shandong area who claimed descent from Lesser-Brilliance explained the bird nomenclature of the latter’s government as symbolic rather than literal. He stated that it was designed to celebrate the appearance of a Feng-Bird at the beginning of his reign. See Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi: Zhaogong 17 (Ssjzs ed. 2:2083); translated in Legge (1966) 5:667–68; also B267–68. For a study of bird motifs in the art of the ancient Yi-Barbarians and their relationship to early mythology, see Wu (1985). In the Guideways, the Land of Lesser-Brilliance ÷ ̨ ßÍ is located in the east. However, in another passage, the commentator Hao Yixing also lo

cated Lesser-Brilliance in the west as a divine o‹cial (H2:25b; 14:1a). For a short summary of myths of Lesser-Brilliance, see Yuan ed., Zhongguo shenhua (1985), 78–79, and for a discussion of him together with the thearch Greater-Brilliance, see Rao (1996). 151. See the first chapter of Sima Qian’s Historical Records, “The Basic Annals of the Five Thearchs” vOG≠“aˆ, which represents the culmination of the historicization of the ancient thearchs. Beginning with the Yellow Thearch, it defines the orthodox genealogy of political legitimacy through Zhuanxu, Thearch Ku “A, Yao, and Shun before turning in subsequent chapters to the dynastic rulers. Shiji (1975 ed.) 1:1–48. Myths of the thearchs and their connections with sanctioned violence are discussed in Lewis (1990), 165–212. For a short discussion of the Yellow Thearch in the Guideways and comparison of these genealogies with that of Sima Qian, see Xu and Tang (1986). For a summary of various myths and origins of the Yellow Thearch, see Yuan ed., Zhongguo shenhua (1985), 347–48; also Wang Zhongfu (1996). Early narratives about the struggle between the Yellow Thearch and Chiyou E◊ are analyzed in Puett (1998). 152. H16:2ab. 153. Thearch Jun “T appears to be unique to the Guideways and does not seem to be mentioned in any other early surviving text. For a study of Thearch Jun, see Kiuchi (1985). For various opinions on the genealogies in the Guideways, see Meng (1962), 44–48; Yuan Ke (1978), 1154–156, (1979), 60–68; Yuan Xingpei (1979), 25–29. Among modern scholars who follow an ethnographic interpretation of Chinese mythology, the thearchs have been seen as deified totems of warring tribes who were later historicized by the philosophers and historians, especially the RuConfucians. For a still valuable but highly opinionated study along these lines, see Karlgren (1946). A survey of many of the modern approaches to Chinese mythology appears in B1–22. 154. This ambiguity in the presentation of Di has led to di erent scholarly interpretations. On the one hand, Suh (1993), 154–59 passim, argues for a distinction between the two types of Di and believes that the similarity between Di in the first five chapters and the Shang royal god reveals the origins of this part in Shang cultural traditions. On the other hand, some modern scholars who regard the pseudohistorical thearchs as heroes of ancient warring tribes attempt a unified interpretation of all the chapters by identifying Di with specific thearchs, especially the Yellow Thearch. For example, in the passage on Mount Kunlun just cited, the commentator Hao Yixing took particular issue with Guo Pu’s assertion that Di was the Yellow Thearch, while Yuan Ke and, somewhat more tentatively, Mathieu, supported Guo’s argument (H2:21ab; M91n5; Y294–95n2). 155. The god Shiyi ¤i is also in charge of the duration of the sun and moon. These gods are recorded respectively in H14:5a, 15:3a, 16:1b, 14:7a. See also Y349 nn5–8. Some of these gods can be related to the names of wind gods inscribed in the Shang dynasty oracle bones. For studies of the ancient wind gods, see Hu (1956) and Matsuda (1986). 156. For a study focusing on these more organized gods, see Itò Seiji (1982). 157. H16:9b. 158. See Chang (1981), 540, where the Xia Sovereign Kai (Qi) and similar figures in the Guideways are identified as wu-shamans. “The Nine Arguments” EG may refer to nine musical movements in the accompaniment. See Chen (1936), 541–43, where he argues that “The Nine Arguments” dance was synonymous with the Dai Dance NR of the Shang, which was a supplication for rain. A poem in the Songs of Chu anthology also titled “The Nine Songs” Eà contains short pieces invoking a variety of spirits, most of whom are associated with water or rain. Another poem in the anthology titled “The Nine Summonses” E¤ contains invocations to the dead soul of a ruler to return to his body. The Xia Sovereign Kai (Qi) is also mentioned in chapter 7, where he is called Qi and described as dancing “The Nine Dai Dances” EN on the Plain of the Grand Music j÷ß•. For further discussion of myths about the Xia Sovereign Kai (Qi), see B83–85 ; H7:1a; Y209–210. 159. This kind of natural medicine is older than what is now called “Traditional Chinese Medicine” §Â, whose theory integrated yin-yang ±ß and Five Agents ≠Ê cosmology, along with the concept of vital-energy , and was codified in the Yellow Thearch’s Classic of Internal Medicine ¿“∫g (c. 1st cent. b.c.e.). Harper (1990), 218n34, argues that despite later competition among professional yi-physicians, fangshi-wizards, and wu-shamans, the pragmatic nature of medical practice during the Qin and Han supported the continuation of earlier methods. Specifically, he finds linguistic parallels between passages in the Guideways and a medical text from a tomb in

Fuyang, Anhui, dated c. 165 b.c.e. (214n15). See Zhong (1931), Itò (1969–1971), Shi eler (1980), and Zhao (1986) for specific studies of early Chinese medicine in the Guideways and its connection with wu-shamans. For further bibliography on this subject, see Fracasso (1991), 98–100. 160. See note 53. 161. Fracasso (1983), 670–71, counted fifty-four events in the first five chapters, of which fortyfive are evil, seven are auspicious, and two are neutral. He argued that the information on ominous creatures reflects an art of “teratoscopy” or divination by monsters that flourished from the Warring States period through the Han and was similar in some ways to practices in Babylonia and ancient Italy. Wu Hung o ered a slightly di erent count: fifty-two omens in the Guideways as a whole, with forty-seven evil prognostications, the latter all in the first five books. He provided further evidence on the use of the Guideways as an omen book in the Han by identifying the caption to a carving of the Bifang-Bird ÒËæ at the Wuliang Shrine ZÁ® (c. 151 c.e.) in modern Jiaxiang, Shandong, and suggested that the evil omens depicted at the shrine were all taken from the Guideways. See Wu (1989), 76–85. Similarities between the Guideways and a demonological occult manuscript recently excavated from a third-century-b.c.e. tomb at Shuihudi, Hubei, are discussed in Harper (1985), especially p. 479. 162. H2:19ab. 163. H16:8b. 164. The text here is problematical. According to Guo Pu, the herb provides longevity. However, the term bazhai KN is understood by Hao Yixing as “eight chambers.” Other commentators and translators suggest “eight chambers for purification,” “eight chambers containing the Herb of the Supreme God Di,” “eight plants consumed during a period of purification,” and “Eight Purification Rites” (H15:2a, 16:6b, 8b; M549; C167; F203n59; Y366n1). 165. H16:3ab. Yuan Ke suggested that the graph ling F be read as wu ≈ (wu-shaman) based on the usage in the Songs of Chu as well as a gloss in the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs. See Y396n1. 166. For a discussion of these shamans, see Chow (1978), 72–83 (H11:6a). 167. The cult of the Transcendents is believed to have originated in the eastern states of Yan P and Qi Ù (modern Hebei-Shandong) and presented a mythology focused on islands in the Eastern Sea such as Penglai [no. 294] where beings who had perfected elixirs of longevity dwelled. It was largely spread by fangshi-wizards who gained influence at court during the Qin and Han dynasties by persuading rulers that they could communicate with the Transcendents and obtain the alchemical formulas for the elixirs. By the Six Dynasties, the cult was substantially absorbed by Daoism and has remained popular in Chinese folklore through the modern period. Later commentators from Guo Pu on sometimes mistakenly identify elements in the Guideways in terms of this cult, and some modern scholars have continued to find traces of influence in the text from fangshi-wizards. Nevertheless, the Guideways overwhelmingly represents a much earlier spiritual outlook, particularly with regard to the secrets of longevity obtained from trees and herbs, not alchemical drugs. Although Penglai is mentioned in chapter 12 as a mountain located in the Eastern Sea and given prominence in the late Ming illustrations, there is no detailed description of it in the text, and it clearly does not rival Mount Kunlun as an axis mundi. Furthermore, the graph for Transcendent P (xian), does not appear anywhere in the Guideways. See H12:6b; Yuan Xingpei (1979), 18–21. 168. Like the Never-Dying Herb £∫ƒ, the tree is associated with the cult of Mount Kunlun and located nearby. Guo Pu commented elsewhere in chapter 6 that eating another NeverDying Tree £∫ on Round Hill Mountain can produce longevity, as can drinking from the Red Spring on the same mountain (H6:4a; H11:5b, 6a). 169. H18:2b; 6:4a. 170. H15:3a. 171. H7:4a; 16:5a. Xuanyuan a’ is the personal name of the Yellow Thearch. 172. This cult of divine wu-shamans continued into the early Han, when it was o‹cially established along with other sacrifices by the first Han emperor Gaozu TMTM (r. 206–195 b.c.e.). Hanshu (1975 ed.) 4:1211. 173. In addition to the people of the Land of Shaman Xian ≈wG, another tribe identified as shamans is the Zhi People T¡ [no. 219], who are descended from the thearch Shun. They are

surnamed Ban l like one of the wu on Shaman Mountain, eat grains, and live in a paradise where they can obtain food and clothing without working. The Guideways notes that they are also known as the People of Shaman Zhi ≈T¡ but o ers no further description of their activities. This people is also mentioned in chapter 6, where they are described as yellow and able to kill snakes with bows and arrows. According to some commentators, the graph zhi T should be read as die, meaning “abundance” (H6:3a; 15:3b). 174. See Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 36–37; also translated in Hawkes (1962), 31. Nine-Similar-Peaks E√s, where Xian descends, is a mountain in modern Ningyuan, Hunan, and a traditional burial site of the thearch Shun. 175. H18:2b. 176. See, for example, Chang (1983), 65 , Major (1999), 129–131, and He (June, 1934): 28–29. 177. Translated in Hawkes (1962), 101–9 and 109–14, respectively. In “The Great Summons” j¤, the performer of the ritual is specifically identified as Shaman Yang ≈ß. The Song commentator Hong Xingzu identified him with one of the six mentioned in chapter 11 who revived Yayu [no. 265] with the Never-Dying Herb and quoted Guo Pu’s commentary to this entry further identifying Yang as a “divine physician”  ́Â. See Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 198. Beginning in the latter half of the sixth century b.c.e., the concept of an ethereal soul (hun Ó) and an earthly soul (po z) developed and gradually became the most common Chinese view of the human spirit. After death, these two souls separated, with the ethereal soul seeking immortality in a heavenly paradise and the earthly soul proceeding to the underworld while still somehow remaining connected with the interred body for a period. 178. For discussions of early Chinese views of death, see Carr (1985), Erkes (1952), Keightley (1991), and Yu (1964–65, 1981). Han views of the hereafter are surveyed in Loewe (1979), 6–9, and (1982), 25–37. In a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Han tomb number one at Mawangdui (c. 168 b.c.e.) near modern Changsha, Hunan, Wu Hung (1992) describes the ritual of summoning the soul during the Warring States and Han and contrasts the arrangements for the corpse with that for the interred body. Another approach to resurrection of the dead in which the living legalistically petition an underworld bureaucracy for release of the soul is not represented in the Guideways. It can also be traced to the Warring States period, however, and is discussed in Harper (1994). 179. In certain cases of demonic activity, it was believed that the natural process of the separation of the two souls had been interrupted, perhaps through improper burial or violent death. In an anecdote in Zuo’s Narratives dated 534 b.c.e., the aristocrat Zichan of Zheng replied to an inquiry about ghosts by stating that even in the case of ordinary people, the ethereal and earthly souls can remain conjoined in the person’s body if they have died a violent death, becoming demonic, and that this was even truer in the case of an aristocrat with higher spiritual qualities. This seems similar to the corpses in the Guideways, though the passage in Zuo’s Narratives does not identify them as such. Conversely, the Guideways does not mention either the ethereal or the earthly soul. In any event, the corpses in the Guideways are not ghosts but strange creatures who are still alive. See Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi: Zhaogong 7 (Ssjzs ed., 2:2050); translated in Legge 5:618. 180. Wang Ziye, who may be identified with another mythical figure, King Hai  ̋Ë [see no. 300], is described by Guo Pu as someone whose “body has been dismembered but whose spirit is intact; whose appearance is bizarre but whose vital-energy is harmonious” (H12:4b). Yuan Ke, however, believes this may be too mystical a reading. However, if these corpses were merely unburied bodies without any spiritual power, they would not have been recorded in the Guideways as strange creatures. See Y319–20 (H18:7ab, 12:1b, 12:4b–5a). 181. H12:3a, 15:4b, F207n84. 182. H17:7b. 183. H9:1b, 14:3a. 184. H7:3a, 16:4b. 185. For an interpretation of the ten suns myth as the founding myth of the Shang dynasty, see Allan (1991), 19–56. In the Guideways, the ten suns are the children of Xihe TMM, the wife of Thearch Jun, who dwells in her own land beyond the Southeast Sea and bathes the suns in the Sweet Depths. For translations of these and other myths of Xihe, see B123–25. The ritual exposure of female shamans is discussed in Schafer (1951) and Qiu (1983). In Shang times, female wu

as well as certain kinds of physically deformed people termed wang ø were burned to invoke rain during a drought. By the Warring States period, burning seems to have evolved into exposure for about eight or nine days, a practice that continued into the Han. 186. H17:6b; Y218, 430–34. This exorcistic curse is a unique piece of shamanistic information preserved in the Guideways. 187. For a thesis along these lines, see Yu (1992). 188. Legends of dog ancestry are known to have existed among Asian peoples from Siberia to Indonesia. Dubois St. Marc documented legends of the dog-tailed people of Java and reproduced photographs taken there of congenital anomalies such as a child born with a “tail” and a hairyfaced man. See Liu (1932). In China, the myth of the union of the dog Panhu L} with a princess, first recorded during the early fourth century c.e., has formed part of the origin myths of local aboriginal tribes in the central and southern regions. See B118–20. 189. Huainanzi 4 (Zzjc ed., 7:62–64); H:Xulu:1b. 190. See He (June, 1934) and Wang (1934). 191. A chapter on maps is included in the “Maps of the Earth” chapter of the Master Guan filGaœ, and it is reasonable to suppose that many early works concerned with geography were accompanied by some kind of image or map. In addition to the Nine Bronze Vessels of Yu, other hypotheses about the origin of the illustrations to the Guideways are that they are: 1) maps recording territories o ering tribute; 2) didactic pictures displayed by wu-shamans for an audience during the performance of religious rituals; 3) frescoes in temples and palaces; 4) images of strange creatures in omen or demonological catalogues. For a history of the illustrations, see Fracasso (1988), especially 93–94. 192. The earliest statement connecting the Guideways with the Nine Bronze Vessels of Yu appears in the “Rhymeprose on the Capital of Wu” d£· by Zuo Si TM‰ (c. 253–c. 307). See Wenxuan (Sbby ed.) 5:6b. The view that the text was originally a commentary on the images was later elaborated on by Ouyang Xiu ⁄ß◊ (1007–72), Yang Shen, and Bi Yuan, among others. 193. See Zhu (1998), 64, who argues that neither Liu Xin nor the “Treatise on Literature” in the History of the Han Dynasty mentioned illustrations. While the burden of proof that early illustrations existed remains and may, at this point, only be resolved by archaeological discovery, it is quite possible that the text in its early phases circulated separately from illustrations in some cases, as it did throughout later periods. Zhu, moreover, disregards the internal evidence in the text that seems to suggest references to images. 194. For remarks on the di‹culties surrounding the graph tu œ see Sivin and Ledyard (1994), 26–27, Clunas (1997), 102–111, and Yee, “Chinese Maps in Political Culture,” 72n9. 195. H:Xu: 3a. 196. Given the presence of variant myths and descriptions of strange creatures in texts as well as the absence of a national religious establishment and an organized priesthood, it is unlikely that there was much consistency in the style or content of divine representations. The remark in the Master Hanfei  ̇Dl (c. before 233 b.c.e) that artists found it easier to depict ghosts and demons rather than dogs and horses because no one had ever seen the former suggests a considerable range in the details of these images. See Hanfeizi 21 (Zzjc ed., 5:202); also note 210. 197. For a creative but controversial theory of the meaning of animal decoration on Shang and Zhou bronzes, see Chang (1981). Chang argues that some of these motifs represent mythological animals that act as agents of shamanistic communication between man and the spiritual world of ancestors and gods, citing the Guideways as textual confirmation. Among the motifs he discusses are the Taotie πK. Feiyi-Snake ŒÚ [no. 113], Kui ‹ [no. 304], and Dragon s and notes that not only do examples of these types vary considerably in their features but that their designations were applied retroactively by later scholars without much foundation. The comparatively recent identification of the Feiyi-Snake motif, for example, is based on a description in the Guideways. It is worth noting that the so-called Taotie widely represented on early bronzes is not mentioned in the Guideways at all. 198. For the theory that these tomb guardians are Earth Lord (Tubo) gB and, moreover, that Earth Lord can be considered a transformation of both Earth God (Houtu) Zg and Yu the Great, see Sun (1973). According to Sun, all three could be represented as a dragon with horns. Early tomb guardians are also briefly discussed in Ho (1991), 86–87.

199. Wang Yi  ̋h (c. 89–c. 158), compiler and annotator of the poems of the Songs of Chu believed that the “Questions of Heaven” was composed by the poet Qu Yuan in response to viewing depictions of gods and spirits of the landscape, ancient heroes, and strange creatures on a mural in the ancestral temple of former kings of Chu and in the sacrificial hall for aristocrats and high ministers. The poem was supposedly written by Qu on a wall next to the mural. See Chuci buzhu (1983), 85. 200. These have been reproduced and described in detail in Zenghouyi mu (1989), 1:26–45. 201. Among the hypotheses are Earth Lord, a kind of occult expert in charge of exorcisms known as the fangxiangshi Ë¤Û, and a kind of Transcendent known as “feathered-man” –H (yuren). See Zenghouyi mu 1:43.
202. This enumeration of the strange creatures in the Chu Silk Manuscript follows Hayashi (1972). 203. See H5:28b, in which these gods are described as having three heads with human faces. These three special mountains along the seventh guideway through the Central Mountains are identified as zhong-level ‡ sacred peaks requiring Grand Corral ”c sacrifices. 204. H6:4a. 205. H3:8a. 206. H1:5b. 207. The Chu Silk Manuscript now in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has been documented and analyzed in Barnard (1973), while the significance of the twelve figures has been studied by Hayashi (1970, 1972), Rao (1972), Rao and Zeng (1985), Li Xueqin (1987), and Li Ling (1985). For brief, updated remarks by Rao and Li Ling at a recent symposium, see Lawton (1991), 175–83. These scholars have all correlated the twelve gods with a set recorded in the early glossary Approaching Refinement, which is believed to reflect Chu usage. Hayashi o ered a further hypothesis that five of these bear names similar to those of wu-shamans mentioned in the Guideways, specifically Peng ^, Gu h, Xie ¬, Yang ß, and Xiang ¤. Thus, he argued, they may also represent divine wu-shamans, though it is not clear how these two groups might have been related. This view is specifically rejected in Li Ling (1985), 33–34, who maintains that the figures are only the gods of the twelve months. This conclusion has been further refined by Li Xueqin (1987), and he and Li Ling both now believe that the Chu Silk Manuscript reflects the form of a practical cosmic diagram known as the Liuren shipan a–°L as used by exponents of the School of Techniques and Calculations. The Chu Silk Manuscript was also briefly discussed in Loewe (1978), 102–8, which o ered another set of hypotheses about the shamanistic nature of the twelve figures. For a recent translation of the text see Li Ling and Constance A. Cook (1999). 208. Although pre-Qin sources mention the existence of murals, illustrated books, and maps, it is only beginning in the Han that more detailed descriptions about book formats have survived. In the “Treatise on Literature” in the History of the Han Dynasty ~—G¿Â” (late 1st cent. b.c.e), a number of texts are recorded as written on bamboo slats g, while the accompanying illustrations or maps are noted as depicted on scrolls  ̃. The Eastern Han scholar Ying Shao ≥o (c. 140–c. 204) noted that it had been the practice of the Western Han court bibliographer Liu Xiang to first transcribe ancient texts onto bamboo slats for editing, then recopy them onto silk scrolls for the imperial library. Another possibility, the use of closely bound bamboo or wood slips as a surface for illustration as well as text, is suggested by the recent discovery of the Shuihudi manuscripts (c. 3rd cent. b.c.e.). See Harper (1985), 466n13. For a survey of early Chinese writing formats, see Tsien (1988), especially 59–89. Recently, the idea that the Guideways originated as captions to a mural has been revived by Yu Quanzhong (1992), who argues that at least as far as chapters 6–9 are concerned, the text derives from captions to an early Zhou mural that preserved Shang worldviews. 209. For a concise description of this piece, see the explanation of plate 53 in Zhongguo meishu quanji (1986), vol. 1, 26–27. 210. See Huainanzi 13 (Zzjc ed., 7:216): “Nowadays, painters like to depict demons and MeiHobgoblins and dislike painting dogs and horses. Why? Because demons and Mei-Hobgoblins do not reveal themselves to people while dogs and horses can be seen every day.” See also Hanfeizi 21 (Zzjc ed., 5:202).

211. The colophons to these strange creatures on the Wu Liang Shrine do not exactly coincide with the extant version of the Guideways. They may reflect an earlier version of the text or perhaps were based on similar omen catalogs. Yet another possibility is that they may have been free transformations by artisans. 212. For a study of the ideological significance of these and other omen creatures depicted in Han tombs, see Powers (1991), 246–78. The twenty-odd creatures selected for representation in the Wu Liang Shrine were intended as political criticism of contemporary problems such as humane government, political oppression, and o‹cial recruitment. The relationship of these creatures to omen books and to the Guideways is also discussed in Wu Hung (1989), 79–84. 213. This scroll is in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (P. 2683). The front and end portions are damaged, as are the illustrations in nineteen out of forty-two sections. A commentary added to the text of section 25 on the Jiao-Dragon [no. 274] quotes the Guideways but actually paraphrases Guo Pu’s commentary. For a discussion and reproduction of the scroll, see Matsumoto (1956). 214. This scroll was divided into two sections: P. 2682 containing nineteen images with texts is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and S. 6261 with six images and texts is in the British Library, London. According to a statement in P. 2682, it originally depicted more than one hundred creatures. The Beast of the White Marsh (Baize) ’A was said to be a divine, talking animal obtained by the Yellow Thearch when the latter visited a mountain. In response to the Yellow Thearch’s inquiry, the Beast told him about 11,520 strange creatures, and the thearch ordered that they be illustrated. Texts titled The Beast of the White Marsh’s Illustrations ’Aœ are first mentioned in Ge Hong’s The Master Who Embraces Simplicity but may well predate the Six Dynasties. For a study and reproduction of these two scrolls, see Rao (1969). A version of the myth of the Beast of the White Marsh has been translated in B235–36. 215. Guo Pu’s commentary occasionally contains such comments as “this creature is included in the depictions of frightening creatures” b»~e§ (see no. 39n74). It is not clear exactly what this refers to. A later description of the set painted by Shu Ya ŒÆ (c. 935–1005) indicated that these images were organized into categories (see note 216). Perhaps “frightening creatures” was such a category or a well-known genre of painting not directly related to the Guideways but overlapping some of its content.

For comments on this painting, see Cahill (1980), 5, and Liu (1958), 38–40. 219. Another clear example of this mode of pictorially domesticating the strange can be seen in a Song painting, which may be a later copy, now in the National Palace Museum, Taipei. It is said to be the unpredictable god of the Northern Sea, Ape-Strength Î¶ [no. 253]. The Guideways describes him as having a bird’s body with a human face wearing two green snakes through his ears as he treads on two green or red snakes. In the painting, however, he has been represented as a quiescent Buddhist monk listening to the doctrine to express the culture’s desire to subdue the unruly passions of this demonic natural force.

In Erya yintu (1884 ed.), 1a–2b. 223. The Shared-Wings Birds are described in chapter 6 of the Guideways as green and red and dwelling in the south. They possess one wing each, requiring them to fly in pairs. Guo Pu noted that they resemble ducks. In chapter 16, however, they are said to dwell in the Great Wilds to the west (H6:1b, 16:6b).

changes in the viewing and reading habits in the Ming and early Qing periods, see Clunas (1997) and Hegel (1998). 225. Because of the nature of traditional Chinese bookprinting, which utilized carved woodblocks instead of movable type, editions could be printed in small numbers as the market demanded, thus costing far less than comparable European methods at the time. Editions could also be reprinted easily enough at later dates, often requiring only a new frontispiece, a more recent preface, and, perhaps, the addition of illustrations. Some surviving editions of the Guideways were republished in this way. For a discussion of the material nature of late Ming book production, see Hegel (1998), 72–163, and for information on commercial illustration, see Hegel (1998), 164–289. 226. See the prefaces by Hu Wenhuan JÂÿ (fl. c. 1593–1596) and Zhuang Rujing  ̄pq (n.d.), also of Hangzhou, the latter dated 1593. This work was obtained by the modern scholar and bibliophile Zheng Zhenduo G∂M (1898–1958), who identified it in 1956 as part of the Collectanea for Investigating Things and Extending Knowledge ÊPO— (late 16th cent.) also edited by Hu of which about 168 titles survive. It is now in the collection of the National Library of China, Beijing. 227. See Moule (1930). He concluded that the book was originally compiled from 1392 to 1430 under the patronage of Zhu Quan ∂v, Prince Ning Á ̋ (1378–1448), but not printed until 1489 under the auspices of a prefect, Jin Xian  ̃— (n.d.), who mistakenly considered it a book from the Song. However, the Cambridge copy is incomplete and lacks a title page. It contains a number of textual errors, and the quality of printing is not that of a publication sponsored by an o‹cial. Thus, it may be an even later, more popular version, perhaps from the late Ming. 228. See Yu ed. (1974), 650–52, which compares the illustrations of foreign peoples in the Library of Congress version of the Complete Handbook with the Cambridge Records and Illustrations and concludes that the latter work is the source for the former. Selections of images from the Collected Illustrations were published in an English-language edition in Goodhall (1979). For specific remarks on the images related to the Guideways, see 12–13 . 229. Ji Yun doubted Wu’s claims and considered all the illustrations to be the creations of later artists’ imaginations. Therefore, he declined to reproduce any of them when Wu’s edition was reprinted in the Complete Works of the Four Libraries. See Ji et al., eds. (1971 ed.), 3:2939. 230. This set of portraits was appended to some editions of Hao Yixing’s version and has been partially reproduced in C, S, and Y. 231. It is worth noting that a bias against representations of gods developed in the late Ming among certain segments of the Neo-Confucian elite who felt that these were not only without foundation but interfered with the more abstract understanding of the Way (Dao D). This led to the elimination of such images in state cults, although not in popular religion. Such an attitude, which may also have been held by some elite readers, may explain why the Supreme God Di and the thearchs are not represented in the Guideways, with the exception of Yu the Great [no. 345]. Even this figure, however, was later dropped from the Chongchen-period reengravings. See Clunas (1997), 77. 232. The name Suming ¿ ̇ appears in the upper righthand corner of plate 1. Wang Xingchun’s name appears in the lower lefthand corner of plate LXII and in the upper right of plate LXVI. Although the artistic style of all the plates is fairly consistent, close comparison reveals subtle di erences between the first sixty-one plates and plates LXII–LXXIV, leading to the conclusion that Liu Suming may have been responsible for the first group and Wang Xingchun for the latter. For more information about Liu Suming, see Fang (1988), 220–22. An example of this edition is preserved in the Harvard-Yenching Library, which also preserves a reprint from the same woodblocks but with a di erent title page dated 1689.

234. This edition titled Shanhaijing tushuo s ̧gœ° with Guo Pu’s commentary was published by the Guangyi shuju sq—Ω in Shanghai but is undated. The illustrations follow a similar series in a slightly older edition with the same name but with Bi Yuan’s commentary published in Shanghai by the Huiwentang |ÂÛ in early 1918. The images have clearly been redrawn, but both series can be seen to originally derive from the Ming and Qing portrait tradition. The Encomiums, which sometimes appear as colophons, are mistakenly attributed to Hao Yixing instead of to Guo Pu. The 1918 edition was also cheaply printed and probably sold for between twenty-five and forty cents in Chinese money.

235. On plates I–XXII, an earlier Chinese reader wrote in the names of the creatures next to their images, a practice sometimes found in other extant editions of the Guideways.
Plates I to LXXVI
1. See “Introduction,” 70 and note 226. Beier is also the name of a mountain located in modern Pinglu, Shanxi. Because Yuer does not appear in the text of the Guideways, later editions of these illustrations from the seventeenth century onward did not reproduce plate I but began with plate II, which was renumbered as plate I. Plate LXXVI was also dropped (Shanhaijing tu 1:6b; Guanzi 16 [Zzjc ed., 5:277]). 2. H1:1a–2b. 3. In chapter 18, the graphs for Xingxing are written as VV (H18:4b–5a). 4. Lüshi chunqiu 14 (Zzjc ed., 6:141).
5. In more recent centuries, the name Xingxing was sometimes used to refer to monkeys such as the orangutan or chimpanzee. Ailao, literally “Sorrowful Cage,” was a prosperous barbarian kingdom that entered into tributary relations with the Han court and whose territory was eventually reorganized into districts by the Eastern Han (H1:1b, 10:3b, 18:4b–5a; M3n4; Y275–76nn2–3). 6. “Hall Mountain” is alternately transcribed as `xßs (Changting zhi shan; Eternal-Court Mountain) (H1:1b–2a). 7. See Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 282, where the graph for yuan (gibbon) is written as μ. 8. H: tuzan œg:1b. 9. H1:2a. 10. Gibbon-Wings Mountain mlßs is alternately transcribed here as ^lßs (Jiyi zhi shan; Millet-Wings Mountain). Following the commentator Wang Niansun  ̋¿] (1744–1832), Yuan Ke (1916–) suggests that it is probably Ylßs (Jiyi zhi shan; Carp-Wings [or CarpFins] Mountain) reading Y ( ji) as V ( ji; Golden-Carp), which is similar to the name of a lake in the region later mentioned in no. 15. This is one of several places whose names contain the graph yi l (wings), but it is not clear exactly what this signifies. Yi is also the name of one of the twenty-eight constellations, so the word may also possess an astronomical significance (H1:2ab; Y3n1). 11. H1:2a. 12. H1:2b; C3. 13. H1:2b. 14. The Niu-Tree is mentioned in the poem “On the Mountain Is the Thorn-Elm” in the Book of Songs ÷gGs≥œ (c. 11th cent. b.c.e.–Han). Commentators noted that it was also known as the “Everlasting-Tree” U≥ and provided strong wood for bows and wheels. It appears to be a kind of ilex or oak. Guo Pu interpreted “red-metal” TM ̃ as copper and “white-metal” ’ ̃ as silver, even though the Guideways generally denotes these elsewhere by the more common terms chitong TM... and yin », respectively. However, Hao Yixing argued that these referred to purple gold μi ̃ and white bronze t. Both Fracasso and Mathieu agreed with Guo Pu (H1:2b–3a; F10n3; M6n3; Maoshi zhengyi 6 [Ssjzs ed., 1:361–62]). 15. H:tuzan:1b. 16. H1:3a. 17. Both Guo Pu and Hao Yixing read the graph d (liu; lingering) as p (li; plow). The PlowOx p ̊ is mentioned later in chapter 4 [see no. 139] and described by Guo as “an ox with tiger stripes” (H1:3ab, 4:1ab). 18. H1:3ab. 19. According to Guo Pu, the graph ≥ should be pronounced as Õ (chan) in Mount Chanyuan (H1:3b). 20. For a short discussion of female jealousy and the Guideways, see Yenna Wu (1995), 40, 79–80. In addition to the Lei, chapter 3 of the Guideways states that eating the flesh of the YellowBird ¿æ, which is perhaps an oriole, could also cure jealousy. Chapter 5 mentions the pearshaped, red-veined leaves of the Yu-Tree ÁÏ as having a similar e ect when worn against the body.

The Chinese denote both goats and sheep as yang œ. The Explanations and Analyses of Graphs records that a sheep’s skin n (dui) was hung high on the city wall to discourage anyone from entering unauthorized areas by frightening their oxen and horses.

It is not clear which mineral “green cinnabar” Co refers to, though Mathieu quotes various opinions such as green jade or malachite (H1:4b; M11). 25. In later usage, gu ¤ refers both to poison produced by insects and reptiles as well as to shamanistic black magic in general. Guo Pu’s commentary notes both meanings, so that eating the Nine-Tail Fox may also undo the e ects of the latter. For more about insect-poison, see Deng (1996); Feng and Shryock (1935); Harper (1990), 225–30 (H1:4b). 26. The myth of Yu the Great’s encounter is recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue dVKÓ (mid-1st cent. c.e.) and is translated in B156.

This passage records the number of mountains and length of the first guideway through the Southern Mountains as stated in the text. However, Hao Yixing noted that only nine mountains along 2,700 li have actually been recorded in the extant version, indicating that a section has been lost. Mathieu noted that Winnower fl and Tail ¿ are two constellations appearing in the Master Zhuang, while Hao Yixing indicated that a citation of this text in the dictionary Chapters in Jade ...g (Yupian, c. 6th cent.) reprints it only as Winnower Mountain. According to Guo Pu, the graph Ú (mao) indicates o ering up sacrificial animals that possess the same color. Yuan Ke, however, disagreed and argued that it indicates a class of animals with hair such as pigs, chickens, dogs, and goats that are appropriate to sacrifice. Modern translators such as Mathieu, Fracasso, and Birrell have followed Guo (H1:5ab; F11; M14; C5; Y8n2). 32.

The extant versions of Tao’s poems identify the bird by other names but later commentators have changed this to the Zhu-Bird to conform to the text of the Guideways. See Davis 2:129. See also Yuan Ke’s theory that the Zhu-Bird is related to myths of Huantou [no. 313] and Danzhu [see no. 313] through linguistic linkage, the bird motif, and the theme of banishment (Y190n2, 274n2). 36. H1:6a. 37. H1:6b. 38. The forms of the graphs Ÿ (yao; forced labor) and √ (luan; chaos) may have been confused with each other, according to commentators (H1:6b; M18n3; Y10n4). 39. The text actually mentions three other mountains standing between Lofty-Brilliance and Floating-Jade. Here and in similar cases below, I have added together the distances between each for the sake of continuity (H1:7ab). 40. H1:7ab. 41. The graph r should be pronounced as t (zi), according to Yuan Ke (H1:7b; Y12n3). 42. H1:7b. 43. Five mountains separate Floating-Jade and Mount Xun (H1:9a). 44. H1:9a, tuzan:2b. 45. Two mountains separate Mount Xun and Mount Luwu (H1:9b).

46. The portrait is reproduced in Y14. 47. The distance recorded in the extant version is actually 7,210 li (H1:10a). 48. H1:10a. 49. For a discussion of the graph · (si) as denoting a kind of wild bu alo in antiquity, see Lefeuvre (1990–1991); also Jenyns (1957).

Six mountains stand between Pray-and-Pass Mountain and Chicken Mountain (H1:12a). 55. H1:12b. 56. Hao Yixing noted that in other versions of this passage, the graph 8 is written as p (H1:12b). 57. Hao Yixing noted that the extant version of the text lists only thirteen mountains for a length of 5,730 li (H1:13b). 58. Hao and Bi read the graph Ë (qi; to pray) as q ( ji; to smear with blood and sacrifice). Following this section is a summary statement believed to have been added by early editors that this chapter comprises forty mountains both big and small along a length of 16,380 li. However, as Hao noted, based on the counts at the end of each guideway, it should have stated that there are forty-one mountains along a length of 16,680 li. This may indicate a copyist’s error. However, the extant text records only thirty-nine mountains along 15,640 li (H1:13b). 59. H2:1a. 60. Guo Pu noted the pronunciation of the graph Ú as similar to that of w (zhen). However, Yuan Ke, perhaps following the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs, stated that it should be pronounced like the graph w (xian).

Mount Fuyu is separated from Greater Lotus Mountain by one other mountain. Based on early sources, Mathieu proposed that the Veined-Plant is a kind of grapefruit. See M44n3. However, in the next entry in the Guideways about Brittle-Stone Mountain, another plant of the same name is described di erently, as resembling a scallion with white flowers and black fruit that can cure itching (H2:3b). 66. H2:3a. 67. H2:3a. 68. H2:3a. 69. The graph ¤ should be pronounced like ‡ (shao), according to Guo Pu. Eminent Mountain is separated from Mount Fuyu by one other mountain (H2:3b–4a). 70. Guo Pu also noted that the graph ~ (li; contagious disease) was interpreted in some other early texts as c– (echuang; severe wounds) (H2:2a, 4a; Shuijingzhu yinde 19:31b). 71. H2:3b–4a. 72. The modern equivalent of the Yellow Guan-Plant ¿q remains unidentified. Guo Pu noted that it was purple and red. Approaching Refinement identified it with the Huan-Orchid £ı, while according to Mathieu a commentary to the Book of Songs equated it with the luomo Y◊, which may be a kind of asclepiad (Erya zhushu 13 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2627]; H2:4ab, 3:13b–14a; M50, 50nn1,2; Shiji [1975 ed.] 1:265; Shuijingzhu yinde 19:30a; Y323n1). 73. One mountain stands between Bamboo Mountain and Black-Ewe Station Mountain. Yuan Ke cited Jiang Shaoyuan’s (20th cent.) interpretion of the term Yingyuan zhi yu (Yingyuan-Jade) ¶Æß... as a misprint for Yingdou zhi yu (Yingdou-Jade) ¶Ëß..., meaning a kind of jade suitable for necklaces. Guo Pu noted several variations in the transcription of Yingyuan (H2:5b; Y27n2, 57n3; Jiang [1966 ed.], 23n10). 74. H2:5b. 75. H2:5b–6a.

76. H2:5b–6a. 77. One mountain separates Black-Ewe Station Mountain from South Mountain. Hao Yixing considered the Cinnabar River a tributary of the Red River mentioned above, but Mathieu suggested that it might have been a textual error confusing this river with the previously mentioned Cinnabar River (H2:6ab; M54n5). 78. H2:6ab. 79. Both Hao Yixing and Mathieu suggested that the graph r be read as „ (shi) based on the glossary Approaching Refinement (H2:6b; M56n1; Erya zhushu 17 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2648]). 80. H2:6b. 81. Two mountains stand between South Mountain and the Mountain of the Supreme God of Heaven (H2:7b–8a). 82. H2:8a. 83. Guo Pu noted that the graph • should be pronounced as ‚ (se). He also indicated alternative names of the Rose River as D (Kui; Straw Basket) and ∂ (Fu; Fu-Plant) (H2:8a–9a). 84. H2:8a–9a, tuzan: 5a; M60nn2,3. 85. H2:9a. 86. H2:9a. 87. H2:9a. It is not clear here if the graph ¿ (huang) in the name of the mountain refers to the color yellow or the Yellow Thearch or is a homonym for “imperial.” 88. H2:9a. 89. For a study of parrots in China, see Schafer (1959) (H2:9ab, tuzan:5a). 90. H2:9b. 91. H2:9b. 92. Lady’s Bed Mountain is the fifth mountain along the second guideway through the Western Mountains. Guo Pu identified Shinie-Stone ¤I as alum s¤. However, several later commentators have suggested that it denotes another mineral known as “black cinnabar” »¶, also ¬¶, which can be used as mascara, writing ink, or fabric dye. It is also said to appear when the king’s virtue extends to the hills and mountains (H2:12a; Y35n1). 93. Among the birds that have been suggested as origins for the mythical Luan-Bird are the pheasant, argus, and peacock. A number of inappropriate translations have appeared over the years including “roc,” “phoenix,” and “simurgh.” The latter, appropriated by the American sinologist Edward Schafer (1913–1991), originally denoted a legendary Persian bird, but there is no convincing evidence of a connection with the Chinese Luan. For a detailed inquiry into the LuanBird in early and medieval Chinese literature, see Hargett (1989) (H2:12ab; Schafer [1985], 288n251; Shuowen jiezi [1977 ed.], 79). 94. One mountain stands between Deer-Terrace Mountain and Lady’s-Bed Mountain. Various commentators have identified the name Baihao ’® as referring to the Brave-Pig [no. 38] (H2:13a). 95. H2:13b. 96. H:tuzan:5b. 97. According to Hao Yixing, the extant text records a distance of 4,670 li. He also noted that the graph x should be read as Ë (qi; prayer). Guo Pu noted that other names for Seal Mountain xs were Cold Mountain Ns and Muddy Mountain Ós (H2:14b–15a). 98. The Zhi-Citrus L is said to be found north of the Huai River a and resembles an orange, according to the Records for Examining the Artisans “uO (Warring States–Han) quoted by Hao Yixing. Mathieu cited identifications of it as the Poncirus trifoliata. See also Fracasso, who notes that the tree is thorny. According to Yuan Ke, Í (hu; tiger) should be read as ¿ (wei; tail) so that the phrase “leopard and tiger markings on its arms” would read “markings on its arms and a leopard’s tail.” Guo Pu noted without explanation that in another version, Lifter is called Boaster (Kuafu j“ [no. 247]). However, there seems to be little connection between the two creatures, leading Yuan Ke to hypothesize that perhaps divine creatures of great power and speed were generically called Boaster the way other mythologies might term such creatures Giant. The graph W (yuan; gorge) often designates a deep lake or river at the bottom of a chasm (H2:15ab; F263; M52n3; Y39n9). 99. H2:15b–16a.

100. H2:15b–16a, 6:1b, 16:6b. 101. Three mountains separate Bell Mountain from Mount Chongwu. There is no scholarly agreement on the meaning of Yao-Stone Ω, which has been translated as “jade,” “emerald,” “turquoise,” “jasper,” and so forth. See also F261. The Guideways denotes the area of an omen’s e ect by various terms expressing di erent degrees of power. Here, the appearance of Gu as a Jun-Bird a ects the yi ∂, which has been variously translated. K. C. Chang described it as indicating a walled town or city in early China, which was sometimes organized as an aristocratic estate or fief. Mathieu translated yi as “les exploitations agricoles,” while Fracasso preferred “area abitativa.” In the Guideways, it denotes the smallest area in contrast to the larger district §, commandery p, state Í, and the world —U. I have translated it as “town,” though the size of these places varied, and some might be better thought of as ancient cities (H2:18a–19a; F29, 29n53; M84; Chang [1976], 61 ). 102. The Guideways as well as later sources identifies Torch-Darkness Î± with Torch-Dragon Îs, despite several discrepancies. In chapter 8, Torch-Darkness is described as similar to the Torch-Dragon of chapter 17. However, in chapter 8, Bell Mountain is located in the northern lands beyond the seas, while in chapter 17, Torch-Dragon is located on Mount Zhangwei π¿s [no. 336] (H2:18a–19a, 8:1ab, 17:8b–9a; Y43n2, 231n1, 438–9; Zhuangzi yinde 16:6:32; B68, 232; Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 93; Hawkes [1962], 49). 103. H2:19ab. 104. H2:19ab; Lüshi chunqiu (Zzjc ed., 6:142); Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 79. 105. The graph ¤ should be pronounced as ‡ (shao), according to Guo Pu. He also stated that the term ›¿ (luomu) referred to r≥ (puluo; snails) (H2:19a–20b). 106. The Ruo-Tree is further discussed in Y437n2. The Guideways also locates the site of Lord Millet’s burial elswhere in chapters 11 and 18. In the latter, it is specifically at the paradisical Plain of the Broad Citadel £sß•. For other myths of Lord Millet, see B20 (H2:19a–20b, 11:2a, 17:8b, 18:2b–3a; M90n2; Y291n1, 445n2). 107. H2:20b–21a. 108. H2:21a–23a. For a complete translation of this passage, see “Introduction,” 39. 109. See the opinions of Guo Pu, Yuan Ke, and Mathieu, which are opposed to that of Hao Yixing that the Supreme God Di mentioned here is the Yellow Thearch ¿“. For a possible representation of Luwu in Han art, see Powers (1991), 77–79 (H2:21a–23a, tuzan:6b; M91n5; Y294n1, 299n3). 110. H2:21b. 111. H2:21b–22a. 112. H2:23a. 113. H2:16b–17a. 114. H2:23ab. 115. H:2:23b, tuzan:7a. 116. H2:23b–24a. 117. Hao Yixing noted other early texts where “Xiwangmu” refers to a foreign land. Fracasso, “Holy Mothers” (1988), argues that the various entries in the Guideways reflect three separate mythological traditions that cannot be combined into a single figure and rejects attempts to trace her back to the Shang oracle-bone inscriptions that speak of a “Western Mother” Ë¿. Her meeting with King Mu is recorded in chapter 3 of The Chronicle of King Mu (Mutianzi zhuan 3 [Sbck ed., 3:8–9]). The line that Guo Pu quotes to mean that she is a daughter of the Supreme God (Mutianzi, 8) was read by later commentators in various other ways. Some have suggested that she appears in this text as a tribal chieftain, but Guo, who wrote the earliest surviving commentary to it, clearly regarded her here as also a goddess. Cahill (1993), 17, and Mathieu (M100–101n4) note that she appears in the Guideways as a shamaness. For studies of her iconography in the Han, see Loewe (1979), 86–126, especially 103–4 for an illustration of the Sheng-Crown ”; also Wu (1989), 108–41. For a study focusing on the Queen Mother of the West in the Tang, see Cahill (1993). A brief summary and translations of other early textual evidence appears in B171–75 (H2:23b–24a, tuzan:7a).

120. The graph ` should be pronounced as m (xing), according to Guo Pu, and  ̋ (lu; record) is a homophone for ¿ (lu; deer), according to Hao Yixing (H2:24b). 121. Three mountains separate Mount Zhang’e from Jade Mountain (H2:26a). 122. H2:26a. 123. For a reproduction of the Bifang-Bird at the Wu Liang Shrine, see Hayashi (1973), fig. 46; also Wu Hung, 81, 243.

One mountain separates Three-Dangers Mountain from Dark Mountain (H2:27a). 127. H2:27a, 12:1a, 16:4ab. 128. H2:27a. 129. H2:27a. 130. One mountain separates Celestial Mountain from Three-Dangers Mountain (H2:27b28a). 131. The fable about the Thearch of the Center can be found in Zhuangzi yinde 21:7:33–35. For the entry on Hundun in Zuo’s Narratives, see Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi 20: Wengong 16 (Ssjzs ed., 2:1862–63); also Legge (1966 ed.), 5:282–83. For translations and studies of these and other Hundun myths, see B95, 98–100; Eoyang (1989); Giradot (1983), 77–133. While Mathieu and Birrell both follow Chinese commentators by connecting Dijiang with Hundun here, Fracasso refrains from doing so and translates this passage without reference to the personified Hundun. Yuan Ke’s identification of Dijiang with Thearch Hong (Dihong) “E, who appears in chapter 14, is not entirely implausible if one accepts that the graph ø ( jiang) may be a variation of E (hong) without the righthand element æ (niao; bird). It also reinforces the alternate transcriptions of this passage that indicate that he is a divine bird. Hao Yixing noted other sources that identified Thearch Hong with the Yellow Thearch (H2:28a, 14:4a, tuzan:8a; F34; M110; Y56n5). 132. H2:28ab. 133. Hao Yixing believed that the discrepancy between Guo’s two descriptions of Rushou was due to a confusion of the graphs ¿ (wei; tail) with Ú (mao; hair). For a study of Rushou in early Chinese texts, see Riegal (1989–1990), who notes that the synthesizing tendencies of Warring States religion tended to represent gods in three ways: 1) as agents of heaven bestowing rewards and carrying out punishments; 2) as members of a cosmological system such as the Five Agents correlated with temporal and spatial schemes; 3) as historicized figures incorporated into the divine genealogies of the major ruling houses of the Eastern Zhou (H2:28ab, 7:6a; Y57n2, 227n1). 134. H2:28b–29a. 135. H2:29a. 136. H2:29a, tuzan:8a. 137. According to Hao Yixing, the extant text records only twenty-two mountains along 6,240 li (6,440 li if the Desert of Shifting Sands is included) (H2:29ab). 138. Upper-Shen Mountain is the sixth along the fourth guideway through the Western Mountains. Shen was a feudal state in modern Shaanxi and Shanxi that was destroyed by King Wen of Chu (r. 689–677 b.c.e.). Its remnants remained militarily active until they were later destroyed again by the state of Qin. In the text, Upper-Shen Mountain is located 320 li north of Shen Mountain ”s (H2:30b–31a). 139. The last two lines of Guo’s encomium echo chapter 11 of The Old Master: “The thirty spokes of a wheel share a single hub but the cart uses the hub’s emptiness to function. . . . Therefore, one can take advantage of what exists while making use of what is empty” (H:tuzan: 8a; Laozi zhuzisuoyin 11A:4:6).
140. Six mountains separate Hard Mountain from Upper-Shen Mountain. The graph £ should be read as m (qi; lacquer), according to Wang Fu (1692–1759). The graph ‹ should be read as u (yin; to chant) according to Guo Pu. For other interpretations, see Hao Yixing  ̨Ì (heqian; yawning), F36 (“un gemito”), M124 (“un carillon”) (H2:33a; Y61n1). 141. Hao Yixing believed that the graph 4 (chui) should be read as } (tui) defined in the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs as a divine beast (H2:33a; Shuowen jiezi [1977 ed.], 189).

142. This Luo River is di erent from the better-known one that flows through the later city of Luoyang (H2:33a). 143. H2:33a. 144. The graph ‚ should be read as fi (yuan), according to Guo Pu. Though Hao Yixing cited the Explanations and Analyses of Graphs as indicating that the graph © (mi) meant “a piece of grass getting in the eye,” Yuan Ke argued that it meant Ω⁄ (yanmeng; nightmare) based on a reading in the Master Zhuang. See also F37 (“accecati”) and M125 (“une optalmie”) (H2:33ab; Y62n2). 145. M127n2 identified the Huai-Tree (Huai) T as the similarly pronounced Huai-Tree (Huai) i, a kind of sophora (H2:33a–34b). 146. See “Introduction,” 1 (H2:33a–34a, 8:5b). 147. H2:34ab. 148. H2:34ab, 12:2ab; Y312n1; Huainanzi 4 (Zzjc ed., 7:65); Shenyijing (Bbcs ed.), 10b. 149. The graph ¢ if read as diao is defined in Explanations and Analyses of Graphs as a vessel for warming things, a reading favored by Hao Yixing. See also M130 (“une bouilloire”) (H2:34b–35a; Shuowen jiezi [1977 ed.], 295). 150. H2:34a–35b, tuzan:9a. 151. Hao Yixing noted that the text literally states that the Rupi-Fish has “fish’s wings” Ωl but cited two other versions that state that it merely has wings (H2:35ab). 152. H2:34b. 153. H2:35b–36a. 154. For the mention of Mount Yanzi in the poem “On Encountering Sorrow,” see Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 27; also Hawkes (1962), 28 (H2:35b–36a, tuzan:9b). 155. H2:36a. 156. The text states that the Slippery-Fish makes a sound like Ô (wu), which Guo Pu interpreted as KÔ (zhiwu; to quarrel). Hao Yixing interpreted it to mean the paulownia Ô‰ and, by extension, the sound of the zither that often was made from the wood of this tree. Since both interpretations are hypothetical, I have followed Guo’s simply because of its comparative antiquity. See also M135 (“leur crie ressemble [au son d’une guitare] de sterculie platanifoliée”), while Finsterbush (1952), 16, prefers Guo’s explanation. F39n92 reproduces both versions in a footnote maintaining that the sense of the text here remains obscure (H3:1b). 157. H3:1b. 158. H3:2a. 159. According to Guo Pu, the name should be pronounced like the graph — (you); however, Hao Yixing stated that the graph Ï should be read as W (shu) as in the version in the Ocean of Jade ... ̧ (1266), which also describes the fish as having a red tail instead of red feathers and three tails (H3:2a). 160.

The literal name of the Youyan, Secluded-Quail, does not seem to fit its categorization as a beast. The graph v (yan; quail) should be pronounced like the graph K (e) according to Guo Pu, while Yuan Ke noted that Guo’s encomium and another version of this passage printed the graph as ∂ (e; nose bridge) (H3:4ab, tuzan:10a; Y73n7).

176. H3:4b. 177. Guo Pu noted that the graph w was also pronounced like the graph  ̃ (ke). According to another version cited by Hao Yixing, only the tail of the Jiao-Bird resembles that of female pheasants, not their feathers (H3:4b). 178. H3:4b–5a. 179. H3:5a. 180. H3:5a. 181.

Most commentators have regarded the text as indicating a single strange creature; however, the ambiguity of the language has led Hao Yixing and Mathieu to consider the possibility that it may refer to “dragons and turtles” (H3:9a; F44n111; M157). 198. According to Hao Yixing, the actual length of this guideway as recorded in the extant version of the text is 5,680 li (H3:9a).

200. Hao Yixing cited both a later passage and another version of the text in which the graphs for LA (Yinze; Imprint Lake) are written as TA (Qiongze; Hilly Lake [see no. 120]) (H3:11a). 201. The Guideways only includes one statement that might refer to a Qilin. In chapter 18, the god Han Liu  ̇y, a descendant of the Yellow Thearch, is described as having “the body of a lin” Ô≠, which may refer to a Qilin (H3:11a, 18:2a). 202. H3:11ab. 203. The controversial question of the meaning of the Taotie decorations on ancient bronze vessels has been surveyed in Kesner (1991). For a further theory that attempts to relate the rebellious god Chiyou with the Taotie and Paoxiao myths based on their common feature of devouring people, see Y374n2 (H:3:11ab, tuzan:11b; Lüshi chunqiu 16 [Zzjc ed., 6:180]). 204. H3:11b. 205. H3:11b–12a. 206. The graph J should be pronounced as Ù (wei), according to Guo Pu. This Wei is thought by commentators to be the same as the Wei-Porcupine b mentioned in connection with Thoroughly-Odd [nos. 83, 283] (H3:12ab; M127n4). 207. The assocation with Lifter (Jufu) may result from the similar sound of its name to Boaster (Kuafu) in Chinese, according to Hao Yixing (H3:12ab). 208. The Great-Line Mountains are located in modern Jiyuan and Huolu districts, Henan. Guo Pu noted that the Ling-Antelope tœ resembled a goat with a large horn. It eats little and likes to roam among the mountains (H2:9b, 13ab; M171n4). 209. H3:13b. 210. H3:13b–14a. 211. H3:14a. 212.

213. The graph J (yu) has been glossed by commentators as – (you; tumor) (H3:14b; M174n1). 214. One mountain separates Celestial-Lake from Horse-Succeeds Mountain (H3:14b–15a). 215. Hao Yixing noted that the Explanation and Analyses of Graphs defines ling ‚ as meaning “neck” and hu J as “protruding chin or jaws” (H3:15a; Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 89, 182). 216.

Eleven mountains separate Departing-Doves Mountain from Scenic Mountain (H3:19b20a). 223. For Tao Qian’s poem, see Jingjie xiansheng ji (Sbby ed.) 4:15 and for a translation, Davis (1983) 1:161–62. The early myth of Spirit-Guardian is briefly discussed in B214–15, and some later versions are mentioned in H3:20a and Y92–93n4. 224. Eleven mountains separate Great-Play Mountain from Departing-Doves Mountain. The graph G is pronounced as } (yi), according to Guo Pu (H3:23ab). 225. H3:23a. 226. Seven mountains separate Dry Mountain from Great-Play Mountain (H3:24b–25a). 227. The text only identifies this creature as Pi, which usually denotes a species of bear. However, Guo Pu’s encomium and Hao Yixing’s commentary identify it as the Pijiu (H3:25a; tuzan:12b). 228. Three mountains separate Inverted Bell and Mufeng Mountains from Dry Mountain. For the pronunciation of the graphs fi_ (chunyu), see F56n149, 92n274. Mufeng Mountain ¿{ ßs could be translated as Mother-Peak Mountain, reading the graph { as p (feng; peak). However, see no. 138 and note 230, in which Mufeng is written as L{ (wufeng; literally, “without peaks”) (H3:25b–26a). 229. H3:26a; 18:7b–8a. 230. According to Hao Yixing, the extant text lists forty-seven mountains along 12,440 li. The text here prints Mufeng Mountain as Wufeng Mountain L{ßs, which could mean “mountain without peaks.” Since the total number of gods is only forty-four, Hao Yixing speculated that some must control several mountains. See Jiang (1966), 26n10, and Yuan Ke’s commentary, which suggest that the graphs “aquatic grass and angelica” ¶≤ are a misprint for “mottled jade scepter” ¶^ as such sacrifices in the Guideways usually involve burial of jade objects (H3:26ab; Y99n1). 231. H4:1ab. 232. H4:1ab. 233. One mountain separates Mount Xunzhuang from Mount Shuzhu (H4:1b). 234. H4:1a–2b. 235. Six mountains separate Solitary Mountain from Mount Xunzhuang (H4:3a). 236. H:tuzan:13a. 237. H4:3ab. 238. The later cults of the Supreme Mountain have been studied in Chavannes (1910) and Kroll (1986). For a record of the Eastern Han emperor Guangwu’s ~ ̇Z (r. 25–57 c.e.) pilgrimage to the mountain in 56 c.e., see Strassberg (1994), 57–62 (H:tuzan: 13a). 239. According to Hao Yixing, the distance recorded in the extant text is only 3,500 li (H4:3b–4a). 240. H4:4ab; F61n164; Y105n1. 241. Vine Mountain is the fifth along the second guideway through the Eastern Mountains (H4:4b–5a). 242. A passage in the now lost Record of Nanyue nV” (n.d.) reprinted in the Tang dynasty Encyclopedia for Elementary Studies Ï«O (early 8th cent.) states that a similar creature has four eyes. This portrait from the Wu Renchen edition is reproduced in Y106 (Lüshi chunqiu 14 [Zzjc ed.] 6:141–42; H4:4b–5a; tuzan: 13b). 243. The graph ¶ should be u ( ji), according to Hao Yixing (H4:5a). 244. H:tuzan:13b. 245. One mountain separates Shining Mountain from Exceedingly Lofty Mountain (H4:5b).

246. H4:5b. 247. H4:5b–6a. 248. Five mountains separate Mount Gufeng from Mount Luqi. If the graph { is read as a variant of p (feng; peak), then this mountain could be translated as “maiden peak mountain” (H4:6b). 249. Hao Yixing believed that the graph ø should be written as v(H4:6b). 250. H4:2b, 4:6b. 251. The graph w is pronounced as u (zhen) according to Guo Pu (H4:6b–7a). 252. H:tuzan:14a. 253. H4:7a. 254.

H4:8b. 261. According to Hao Yixing, the extant text only measures 6,400 li (H4:9a). 262. Y113n1. 263. According to Guo Pu, the graph t should be pronounced like the graph Ø ( ge). However, Hao Yixing argued that its name should actually be tc (Gedan) (H4:9a). 264. H4:9b. 265. The text of the “Questions of Heaven” prints the graph Ô; however, most later commentators have followed Liu Zongyuan’s hv∏ (773–819) “Answers to the ‘Questions of Heaven’ ” —Ô, which treated it as a mistranscription for ∂ (que; magpie) and assumed that these lines allude to the creatures recorded in the Guideways. See also Hawkes’s translation of the Qi-Magpie as “monster bird” (H4:9b; Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 96; Hawkes [1962], 49). 266. H4:9b. 267. H4:9b; M236; Y114n1. 268.

H4:10b. 273. H4:10b. 274. H4:11a. 275. Shuowen jiezi (1977 ed.), 119 (H4:11a). 276. The Tuo-Rat remains unidentified (H5:1ab). 277. One mountain separates Mount Quzhu from Sweet-Jujube Mountain. According to a passage in the Record of Collected Places Aa” (Tang dynasty) cited by Hao Yixing, the name of this mountain, literally “Canal-Pig” Îfi, may be a combination of two di erent names for this mountain, Canal Î and Pig fi. This mountain is also considered part of the Bo Mountains (H5:2a). 278. Seven mountains separate Oxhead Mountain from Mount Quzhu (H5:3ab). 279. Guo Pu gave the pronunciation of the graph \ as pei, while Wang Fu glossed it as fei and Mathieu and Fracasso read it as ku (H5:3b; F73; M248; Y120n1). 280. Fresh Mountain is the fourth mountain along the second guideway through the Central Mountains (H5:5b). 281. H5:5b. 282. The description of this Longzhi di ers from another beast also named Longzhi [no. 150]. The graphs for zhi are written slightly di erently in both cases.

284. Two mountains separate Vine-Channel Mountain from Mount Kunwu (H5:6b–7a). 285. H5:7a. 286. Guo Pu noted that other versions record the name of Tall-Bank Mountain Œ§ßs as Presentation Mountain ms and that the place produced “fine stone” rather than “fine jade.” He also was unable to identify the trees in the Yellow River Forest; however, Hao Yixing and Mathieu believed the Qian » is the Qiancao »Û (Rubia cordifolia, i.e., madder bush) and that the Ju | is the willow h (H5:7b; M258nn5,6). 287. Hao Yixing identified the graph M as a variant of I (shan) while Guo Pu noted that it should be pronounced like the graph Ò (tian) (H5:7b–8b). 288. For various myths of Gun, see B79–81 (H5:7b–8a, 18:10b–11a; F77; M260–61; Y125–26, 472–75). 289. Guo Pu noted that the Gaoben xa was a fragrant plant, and in another version of the text, the Xun-Plant  ̊Û is called the Bao-Plant cÛ (H5:8b–9a). 290. H5:8b–9a. 291. H5:9a. 292. One mountain separates Harmony Mountain from Black-Horse Mountain (H5:9b–10a). 293. H5:10a; Lüshi chunqiu 6 (Zzjc ed., 6:58). 294. According to Hao Yixing, the distance recorded in the extant text is only 80 li (H5:10ab). 295. Supported-Pig Mountain is the second along the fourth guideway. Guo Pu noted that the graph U is also pronounced like the graph G (mi). The graph A is a variant of } (ruan), according to Hao Yixing (H5:10b–11a). 296. H5:10b–11a; C74. 297. While Guo Pu pronounced the graph ` as j (sou) and believed it to be a kind of madder, Hao Yixing argued that based on the glossary Approaching Refinement it refers to a kind of orchid and is properly pronounced like ≠ (gui) (H5:11a). 298. H5:11a. 299. H5:11ab. 300. H5:11ab. 301. Head Mountain is the second along the fifth guideway. Hao Yixing read the graph  ̋ as a variant of ¿ (lu; deer) (H5:13ab). 302. H5:13ab; F81; M271–72; Y132–33. 303. If the graph { is read as p (feng; peak), then Pingfeng could mean “flat-peak” (H5:16ab). 304. H5:16ab; Y136n1, 137n5; Hanshu (1975 ed.) 7:2038. 305. One mountain separates Mount Gui from Mount Pingfeng (H5:16b–17a). 306. Four mountains separate Secret Mountain from Mount Gui (H5:18ab). 307. Great Misery Mountain is the seventh along the seventh guideway through the Central Mountains. The graph y is a variant of W (ku; misery), according to Hao Yixing (H5:23b–24a). 308. Hao Yixing suggested that perhaps Noble Mountain was located in the area of Guiji Commandery (modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), since there were no other records confirming a Yangxian district in Wuxing (H5:23b–24a; Erya 16 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2640]). 309. H5:24ab. 310. H5:24ab. 311. According to Hao Yixing, the distance recorded in the extant text is only 1,056 li (H5:28a). 312. The final phrase repeats the earlier description of the sixteen gods (H5:28b). 313. The graph V is read as W (zhu), according to Guo Pu. This illustration may also be the Jiao-Fish BΩ, a kind of shark that is found in the Zhang River sÙ farther on (H5:28b–29a; G355–56). 314. One mountain separates Proud Mountain from Scenic Mountain. The commentator Wu Renchen read the graph W as e (tuo; alligator). See also no. 198 (H5:30a; C85; F95). 315. H2:7a, 5:29b; Erya 13 (Ssjzs ed., 2:2629). 316. H5:30ab. 317.

this passage appear to be corrupt. The translation follows the reconstruction of Yuan Ke based on Jiang Shaoyuan. For a more literal rendering, see F97 (H5:33ab; M318–19; Y156n2). 322. H5:34ab. 323. Although the shape of this creature is clearly that of a turtle, the dragon-like face and relatively large size suggest that it might be the artist’s attempt to depict a Tuo-Alligator (G366; H5:34ab; Y156n1; Lüshi chunqiu 5 [Zzjc ed., 6:52]; Erya 19 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2653]). 324. One mountain separates Mount Ju from Mount Min. The reading North River instead of Long River is based on Guo Pu’s annotation (H5:35ab). 325. H5:35ab. 326. One mountain separates Snake Mountain from Mount Ju. The graph X is pronounced as x (si), according to Guo Pu as corrected by Hao Yixing (H5:36a). 327. H2:14a, 5:24ab, 36b; F262. 328. H5:36a. 329. H5:36a. 330. According to Hao Yixing, the extant text records the length of this guideway as 3,650 li. This passage is corrupt in several places and has been corrected according to the suggestions of Hao Yixing and Yuan Ke: the graph Â is read as ¢ (min), Ú is read as Œ (yong), and u is read as “ (di) (H5:38ab; Y160–61). 331. Mount Fuzhou is the fifth mountain along this guideway. The commentary to this passage contains an encomium by Guo Pu that di ers from the one collected in the Encomiums (H5:39a, tuzan:18b). 332. H4:8ab, 5:39a, 8:4a; Y242n2. 333. Abundance Mountain is the sixth mountain along this guideway (H5:41b). 334. H5:41b. 335. Two mountains separate Yaobi-Stone Mountain and Abundance Mountain (H5:42a). 336. Chunqiu zuozhuan zhengyi: Huigong 1, Zhuanggong 29 (Ssjzs ed., 2:1718, 1782); H5:42a. 337. Hao Yixing and other commentators considered the graphs ŸÙ (Jishui; Relief River) to be a mistake for RÙ (Yushui; Nurturing River), since the Ji River does not flow into the Han but into the sea. They also argued that ‰ ̃ßs (Mount Zhili) was a mistake for  ̃ßs (Mount Gongli) (H5:42ab; Y166nn1,2). 338. H5:42b. 339. One mountain stands between Mount Jinli and Mount Zhili (H5:43a). 340. The graph z is read as \ (ku), according to Guo Pu (H5:43a). 341. The meaning of protecting against the e ect of wind (feng ∑) here is ambiguous, but it may be a misprint for a homonym, ∆ (feng; insanity, paralysis, apoplexy). Among various translations and commentaries are “preventing fear of winds from heaven” (Guo Pu, H5:43a); “non resta paralizzato” (F106); “maux de tête” (M343); “gouty arthritis” (S133); rheumatism and other illnesses caused by moisture (Wang Fu, cited in Y167n5); and “lunacy” (C95). 342. Four mountains separate Follow Mountain from Mount Yiku (H5:44a). 343. H5:44a; Erya 16 (Ssjzs ed., 2:2640). 344. Two mountains separate Happy-Horse Mountain from Follow Mountain (H5:44b). 345. Six mountains separate the Mountain That Relies on the Supreme God Di from HappyHorse Mountain (H5:45ab). 346. Erya 19 (Ssjzs ed., 2:2652). 347. Six mountains separate the Mountain That Relies on the Supreme God Di from Fresh Mountain. The expression §j should be read as § ̧ (moquan; desert dog), according to Hao Yixing (H5:46b–47a). 348. H5:46b. 349. Grandee Mountain is the sixth mountain along this guideway. The graphs ““ should be read j“ (dafu; grandee) and  ̊TM should be read as  ̊\ ( jigu; chicken grain), according to Bi Yuan and Hao Yixing. The latter is identified as a kind of dandelion with medicinal properties according to Mathieu (H5:42a, 49b–50a; F254; M340n2; Y176n1). 350. H5:53a. 351. H5:50a–51b; M119n6; F257; C100. 352.

Chuci buzhu (1983 ed.), 59–68, translated in Hawkes (1962), 37–39, also Waley (1955), 29–36 (H5:50a–51b). 353. The commentators Bi Yuan and Hao Yixing considered this an interpolation of the late Zhou-Qin period and not part of the original text of the Guideways, since clearly these remarks could not have been uttered by Yu the Great. Both Guo Pu and Hao noted that these lines appear in the “Measurements of the Earth” chapter of the compendium Master Guan, where they are spoken by Guan Zhong in response to a question by Duke Huan about the extent and bounty of the earth. The text concludes with an early count, perhaps by Liu Xin, of 15,503 graphs for the first five books of the Guideways. However, Hao Yixing counted 21,265 graphs, indicating considerable expansion of the work over the centuries (H5:53b–54b; Guanzi 77 [Zzjc ed., 5:382]). 354. H6:1ab. 355. H6:1ab, tuzan:20a. 356. The graph – (yu) may mean “wings” and/or “feathers.” The illustration here depicts them as having human bodies with wings. However, the portrait in the Wu Renchen edition reproduced in Y187 depicts their entire bodies covered with feathers as well. The text here and in many later places records alternative versions. Some scholars have seen this as the work of Liu Xin, for when alternative versions are noted by Guo Pu, they usually appear within his own commentary (H6:1b–2a). 357. The depiction of Transcendents as Feathered Men was conventional in the Eastern Han. However, such illustrations were derided by the iconoclastic thinker Wang Chong  ̋R (27–c. 100 c.e.) in the “Formless Things” chapter of his collection of philosophical essays, Judicious Disquisitions ◊≈GLŒg (c. 70–80 c.e.). The Bifang-Bird was earlier described in more detail in chapter 2. Hao Yixing believed that the human face mentioned here is a textual error. This bird was mentioned in the “Ten Faults” chapter of the philosophical work Master Hanfei  ̇DlGQL (before 233 b.c.e.) as one of the guardian animals of the Yellow Thearch when he met with a group of demons and gods. In later mythology, it was regarded as the essence of wood, one of the Five Agents (Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 167; Hawkes [1962], 83; Hanfeizi 10 [Zzjc ed., 5:44]; H2:26a, 6:2a; Lunheng [Zzjc ed., 7:15]). 358.

The graphs TÚ (sanmao; three hairs) appears to be a textual corruption of T] (sanmiao; three sprouts) based on homophonic graphs (H6:3ab). 363. The graph T is also pronounced as ¿ (ti), according to Guo Pu (H6:3a, 15:3b). 364. H6:3b. 365. The Yuan dynasty text A Record of Strange Regions ßÏ” by Zhou Zhizhong PP§ (n.d.) cited by Yuan Ke appears to be di erent from the Ming text of the same name discusssed in the “Introduction” (H6:3b; Y194n1, 195, 195n2; Shizi 2:4a [Sbby ed.]; Zhushu jinian 1 [Sbck ed., 1:2b]). 366.

H7:5b–6a. 402. The text has been reconstructed by Guo Pu and other commentators (G451; H7:5b–6a; Y226; Zhushu jinian 2 [Sbck ed., 2:5a]). 403. H7:6a. 404.

409. Hao Yixing noted that the pronunciation of the graph d (liu) in dQ (Liuli) is roughly homophonous with X (rou; flexible) in XQ (Rouli) (H8:1b). 410. The pronunciation of the graphs  ̊p (Niuli) appears to be roughly homophonous with Liuli and Rouli. See note above (H8:1b, 17:8b; Y232–33n1). 411. H8:1b–2a. 412. For other myths of Gonggong, see B97–98; also Boltz (1981), who interprets Gonggong as a personification of the Deluge and of chaos, with Yu the Great as the restorer of order (H2:16a, 8:1b–2a, 12:2b, 17:5b; Huainanzi 3 [Zzjc ed., 7:35]; Y233n1). 413. H8:2ab. 414. Hao Yixing noted that the graphs @ÿ (yimu; one eye) were probably a misprint for @Í (yiyue; another version states . . . ) (H8:2ab, 17:7a; Shizi 2:4a [Sbby ed.]; Y236n2). 415. H8:2b; F147. 416. While Hao Yixing doubted that the Pendant-Ears People were the same as these people, Yuan Ke and Mathieu believed the two were identical. The Tang myth about the Big-Ears People appears in Li Rong (Yuan) ıæ(∏) (fl. 10th cent.), A Record of Singular and Strange Things Wß” (n.d.) (H8:2b, 17:4a; M418n4; Y237n1). 417. H8:2b–3a. 418. The theory of Shen Yanbing H≠B (also known as Mao Dun Ÿfi and Xuan Zhu »], 1896–1981 ) is briefly stated in Xuan Zhu (1929) 2:1–17. Yuan Ke interpreted Kuafu’s name to mean “giant” and traced his lineage back to the Flame Thearch. For a further discussion of Kuafu, see B215–16, which interprets his name to mean “boastful father” or “braggart man.” A photograph of the contemporary statue of Kuafu appears as the frontispiece to Shanhaijing xintan (1986) (H5:20a, 8:2b–3a, 11:1b–2a, 17:3b, 4b–5a, tuzan:24b; B218–19,Y238, 427–28; Liezi zhuzisuoyin 5:27:15–5:28:5, 5:28:7–8). 419. H8:3ab. 420. This passage concludes with the phrase “in another version, they are called ‘Bofu,’ ” which contradicts the beginning and supports the view that initially this place was identified as the Land of [the People of] Kuafu j ̃Í (H8:3b; M420–21; Y240n1). 421. H8:4a. 422. Yuan Ke’s reconstruction is based on reading the graph ’ as Ù (ying; goiter) (H8:4b; Y242nn2, 3; Huainanzi 4 [Zzjc ed., 7:63]; Zhushu jinan 1 [Sbck ed., 1:19a]). 423. H8:5b. 424.

See also Yuan Ke’s ingenious but highly speculative theory that myths of Ape-Strength and Yujing provide the foundation for the fable of the Peng-Bird P and the Kun-Fish À in the Master Zhuang.

439. Twenty-five clans were established from among the descendants of the Yellow Thearch. Fourteen among his children were elevated to o‹cial rank because of their virtue, and twelve of them received surnames. In the Guideways, foreign peoples who have these surnames could claim kinship to the rulers of the Chinese feudal states and were regarded as less barbarian than other peoples (Guoyu 10: Jinyu 4 [1978 ed., 2:356]; H9:5a, 17:3b–4a; M445n1; Y264nn1,2, 425n2). 440.

489. Hao Yixing, quoting Yi Yin’s Orders to the Peoples in the Four Directions (Yi Yin sifang ling, n.d.), suggested that Tafei refers to the Taer People l’, who are listed there as dwelling to the west, as the graphs D (fei) and ’ (er) are similar in form. Mathieu, however, o ers various other hypotheses based on linguistic arguments (H12:3a; M489n4). The Giant Wasps jh along with the Red Ants ∂ø are located before the entry for Tafei in the text. According to Guo Pu, these are identical to the Black Wasps »h and Red Ants ∂c mentioned in the poem “The Summons of the Soul” in the Songs of Chu. The Black Wasps have bodies as large as gourds and, according to the commentator Wang Yi, are poisonous while the Red Ants resemble elephants. However, in the poem, both are located in the west rather than the north (Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 200; G522; H:12:3ab; Hawkes [1962], 104; M489n4). 490. H12:3a. 491.

Fu Qian’s description was quoted in a commentary to a passage in the “Basic Annals of the Five Thearchs” chapter of the Historical Records that records a variation of this myth from Zuo’s Narratives. It is also recorded in Yuan, ed., Zhongguo shenhua chuanshuo cidian (1985), 449 (Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 218; H12:3ab; Hawkes [1962], 110; F179n222; Shiji: Wudi benji [1975 ed.] 1:38; Y314n2). 496.

The passage about Zouwu cited by Guo Pu does not appear in the extant text of the Six Bow-Bags (H12:3b; Y315n3). 500. H12:4ab. 501. Hao Yixing suggested that the alternate name for Bingyi’s location might be §•ßW (Zhongji zhi yuan; Gorge of Extreme Centrality), arguing that the homophonous graphs æ (zhong; loyalty) and § (zhong; centrality) were interchangeable in antiquity. Mathieu regarded this segment as a later interpolation, perhaps by Guo Pu. The Confucian concept of “loyalty” does seem inappropriate here (Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 76–78, 99; H12:4ab, tuzan:28b; Hawkes [1962], 42; Huainanzi 4 [Zzjc ed., 7:233]; M492–93; Shizi 2:14a [Sbby ed.]; Y316–18; Zhuangzi yinde 12/4/82, 42/17/1–44/17/53). 502.

Hao Yixing and Yuan Ke read the graphs ‚’ (lianger; “both ears”) as ‚u (liangbi; “both arms”) based on a similar passage in the Imperial Digest of the Taiping Era, though this interpretation is not accepted by Mathieu. For a brief survey of other myths of giants, see Y252n1, 341n1 (H9:1ab, 12:6b, 14:2b, 17:2ab; M527n2; Taiping yulan yinde, 377, 494). 516. H14:3a. 517. H14:3a, tuzan:29b. 518. H14:3a. 519.

In the alternate genealogy of the Yao People n¡in the Guideways, Yuan Ke considered the graph ∏ (xi) as a homophone for ˆ (yi), thus indicating another way the Youyi ≥ˆ tribe was connected with Xi and Shun (B105–8; Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 106–7; H14:5b–6a; Hawkes [1962], 52; Legge [1966 ed.] 3:122; Y351–54; Zhushu jinian 1 [Sbck ed.], 1:16ab). 522.

Although the name Yinglong is sometimes translated literally as “responding dragon,” Wang Yi and Guo Pu commented that it means “a dragon with wings.” The custom of fashioning clay dragons to invoke rain during a drought is discussed in Qiu (1983). An artist’s interpretation of the image from the Wu Liang Shrine dated 1821 appears in B133 (B132–34; Chuci buzhu [1983 ed.], 91; H14:7b, 17:5a, 6ab; Hawkes [1962], 48). 532. H15:1a. 533.

The term KN (bazhai; eight chambers) is highly problematic here. Guo Pu left no comment, though Hao Yixing interpreted it as “eight meditation chambers.” Mathieu suggested that it signifies eight plants consumed during a ritual of purification. The translation follows Hao in assuming that it refers to eight structures of some kind (Erya zhushu 17 [Ssjzs ed., 2:2649]; H15:2a; F203n59; M549n3).

Earlier, in chapter 2, it was recorded by its more common name, £Pßs (Buzhou zhi shan). For an interpretation of Gonggong as the personification of the Deluge, see Boltz (1981). Gonggong was identified with several other water gods in Yuan, “Gun” (1940). This could also illustrate the goddess Nüwa kE, who was noted by Guo Pu and others as originally a snake with a human face.

In the discussion of the Grand Exorcism in the “Treatise on Ritual and Ceremony” in the History of the Latter [Eastern] Han Dynasty (Houhanshu: Liyizhi, late 2nd cent. c.e.), Jiangliang’s name was written with variant graphs as jÁ (H17:4b; Houhanshu [1965 ed.] 11:3185; Y427n4). 582. H17:6a–7a. 583. The graph { is an alternate rendering of Ÿ (ba) in some later texts. This could also be a figure recorded later in the text, Xian, Woman of the Red River TMÙkm, who similarly wears green clothes. However, Guo Pu and other commentators believed that she is identical to Drought-Fury (B132–34, 66, 77; G612–13; H16:2ab, 17:6a–7a, 18:9b; Maoshi zhengyi: Datian [Ssjzs ed., 1:476]; Y430–33). 584.

The Lin Ô, also known as the Qilin QÔ and popular in later Chinese folklore as an auspicious beast, is not found anyplace else in the Guideways, so the graph may well have been a misprint. On the other hand, no other creature is described as having a scaly body either. Among the other textual problems with this passage is the description of Han Liu’s ears by the term ‘’ ( jiner). Guo Pu confessed that he did not understand it, while Hao Yixing interpreted it as the final particles ‘‡ ( jiner). Yuan Ke and others preferred “small ears” and Mathieu, “des oreilles dont il prend soin.” I have followed Fracasso, who o ered the hypothesis of “orrechi vigili.” The phrase “a daughter of Zhuo” attempts to represent the graphs Ôl (zhuozi). Hao Yixing interpreted this to mean “a daughter of the Zhuoshan Clan” BsÛ (Zhuoshanshi) or “a daughter of the Shushan Clan“ æsÛ (Shushanshi) based on linguistic and textual arguments (H18:1b–2a; F234, 234–35n228; M626). 594. H18:4a. 595. In some later versions of this passage, the graphs Q ̄ (yanzhang; supervisor of salt) are written as ? ̄ ( jianzhang; chief supervisor) (H18:4a; F237, 237n243; M630n6; Y448n2). 596.

H18:8a. 607. H18:10b–11a. 608. For myths about Yu the Great, see B81–82 . A recent reinterpretation of the origin of myths about Yu and the Deluge based on ancient astronomical events appears in Porter (1996) (H18:10b–11a, Xulu:1ab) and a survey of four traditions of Chinese flood myths in Birrell (1997).
