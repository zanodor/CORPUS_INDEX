Kalpadruma sculptures with Indus Script hieroglyph embellishments to signify Meluhha categories of wealth resources
Some sculptural friezes of kalpadruma show additional iconographic details which define the narratives related to the sacred tree. One more image posted on Twitter (shown below), a vase containing mint coins is shown in one scene and a lotus tāmarasa 'lotus' (Pkt.) rebus: tāmra, tamba 'copper'; कणर्क kárṇaka, 'pericarp of lotus' karaṇī 'scribe, supercargo', kañi-āra 'helmsman'. On some sculp;tures, kinnari's are shown; kinnara are associated with Kubera who is a divinity associated with riches and treasure.
I submit that these features are in the Indus Script Cipher tradition of rendering Meluhha rebus hieroglyphs to signify wealth resources.

Medium: Photographic print Date: 1875 Photograph of a pillar capital carved in the form of a tree from Beshnagar, taken by Joseph David Beglar in the 1870s. Besnagar is located at a fork between the rivers Betwa and Bes. It was a large city from the Mauryan period onwards which has been confirmed from the coins found at the site. The pillar capital shown in this photograph is carved in the form of a banyan tree which we can assess from the shape of its leaves. It also represents the wish-fulfilling tree (kalpadruma or kalpavrksa) as indicated by the riches and treasures carved around it. The sacred railing at the base is the vedika that used to be built around sacred trees and sacred spots or chaityas in ancient India. The capital bears no inscription, but it has been dated to the Shunga period. The statue is now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/s/019pho000001003u01305000.html

Pratimaa of 10th Jain Tirthankar Shitalanatha with his symbol of Kalpavriksh below. "Kalpavriksha (Devanagari: कल्पवृक्ष ), also known as kalpataru, kalpadruma or kalpapādapa, is a wish-fulfilling divine tree in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. It is mentioned in Sanskrit literature from the earliest sources. It is also a popular theme in Jain cosmology and Buddhism. The Kalpavriksha originated during the Samudra manthan or "churning of the ocean" along with the Kamadhenu, the divine cow providing for all needs. The king of the gods, Indra, returned with this tree to his paradise. Kalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as Parijata (Erythrina variegata), Ficus benghalensis, Acacia, Madhuca longifolia, Prosopis cineraria, Bassia butyracea, and mulberry tree (Morus nigra tree). The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature...In Myanmar, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the significance of the Kalpavriksha is in the form of an annual ritual known as Kathina (presenting a robe) in which the laity present gifts to the monks in the form of money trees.(Padma, Sree (17 September 2013).
