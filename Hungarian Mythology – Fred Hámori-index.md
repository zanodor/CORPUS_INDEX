God and his helpers
by Fred Hamori
The follwing essay also reveals who is the true creator of the
humanity...
This only a short summary of Hungarian Mythology starting from
before their conversion to Christianity. This first part will mainly be
about God and his helpers, other parts will deal with the Devil and his
deimons and Mythical Heroes.
The last millennium has obliterated much of the old traditions,
especially since there was a strong anti-Hungarian propaganda in the
Church, which tried to prove that the Christian Church was
responsible for all that was good like religion, culture, letters and
everything was thought to the “wild and nomadic” Hungarians by the
church. This must always be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism
especially since we have records and physical proof showing that
Hungarians were literate using a script similar to the Central Asian
Turks and the some of the Scythians, whose earliest remnants were
found near Alma Ata. (Isik) Words for book, letters, writing are all
from the east. Most of the words associated with religion, farming,
cities, tools and basic professions were not European in origin in
Hungarian but were from Asia.. therefore they were brought with
them from their earlier homeland and not thought to them by the
“civilized and cultured” Europeans, as the church maintained so long.
Especially since this was the Dark Ages in Europe at that time. In any
case after more than a millennium of living in the center of Europe,
much of the Hungarian language has been Europeanized in the sense



and meaning of their words. This sometimes causes problems in
properly understanding the old meaning of some words in ancient
times.
The type of religion they practiced was monotheistic, where god was a
formless spirit, never represented with images and often associated
with the Sun and the sky. Remnants of this association are found even
today in remote Transylvanian villages. The following references from
the European chroniclers of the time remain.. Recent evidence and
research that many of the Huns & Sabirs who lived in the Caucasus
were Christianized and these were in close contact with the
Hungarians. The Georgian and Albanian early chronicles documented
their conversion to Christianity under the guidance of Cardinal Israel
and their building of Churches and translating and writing of the bible
into their own language and their own runic script, whose remnants
(the writing method) survived in Hungary into modern times.
Early Reference to their religion.
Theopylaktos Simocata /Greek/ : “The Turks (Hungarians) respect
fire, air, water and even the earth and sing praises to earth, however
they only worship the one who created heaven and earth.” [Note the
Greeks called Hungarians at first Turks and only later did they get
familiar with their proper Magyar (Macar) name after they settled
next to them.]
Abufeda /Arab? or Persian/ :”The Magyars are a Turkic nation, their
territory is between the Bedsenak (later absorbed by Hungarians) and
the Sikul (also absorbed by Hungarians). Both were eastern nations in
origin.
The other neighboring nations of the Hungarians before their
settlement in their current homeland also had a similar religion as the



following examples show.
Menander: The Avar-Hun Khan swears to the god of fire “deus ignis, aui
in coelo est.”
Desguignes (French historian) “.. The Hiung-nu king Tanjou, as his
name indicates him to be the ‘son of heaven and earth’, worshipped the
sun at dawn and the moon at night, and gave offerings to the sky and to
the earth.” [This refers to the eastern Hun emperor.]
Herodotus /Greek/ “.. amongst the gods they (Scythians) worship the
following: first of all Hestia (fire)..”
In the first contact with Hungarians, some Christian priests believed
them to be Christian due to their religious manners. However at the
time of their settlements there were some who were also Manichean
and some were Muslim as well. Many however were simply a
variation of the Magian/Parse religion as is indicated by their religious
terminology. God=Isten, Heaven=Meny, Hell=Pokol, Devil=Ordog
are found in eastern Manichean terminology also. Greek references to
the house of Álmos the father of Árpád, and the first Hungarian
dynasty (in Europe) state that their religion was Manichean.
Priestly titles:
Táltos Priest king (root-word is wisdom, knowledge “Tud, Tut”
Magoch Magus, Magian priest (root-word magia=bonfire)
Bacsa,Baksa Priest of crafts, science
Harsány Priest of song and ceremonies
Arbis Priest of medicine (modern “doctor”=Orvos)
Barus,Rasdi Priest of magic (modern Varázs)
Garabonciás Priest of storm black magic. (from Kara-pan)
The name of the “bonfire” or the sacred flame of old, remains as
Magia in modern Hungarian, recalling the old Magus priests who



maintained the sacred flames.
The most typical Hungarian word for a church (not used by Catholics)
is even today called Egy-ház, which in a simplistic way is translated as
the house of ONE. However this same word EDGY or ÜGY is also holy
in meaning and the word for GOD in Hungarian IS-TEN is also related
to the universal ONE god, since in Babylon and Persia also a special
word described the universal ONE as ISTEN (Babylon) and YSTEN
(Persia). Hungarian legends all state that they came from the
borderlands of Persia. This word ISTEN is not Persian in origin as far
as I know. It can be best explained with Sumerian from the word ASH
TEN (first/one creator). The TEN word means godly spirit in the other
Altaic languages also, and perhaps they passed the word even to the
Chinese as the word for heaven “tien”. The word is also found in early
Parthian as shown by an inscription on one of their temples to the
goddess Nana. (N.N. Y.S.T.N.) It was the Parthians and not the
Persians who ruled during the time of Christ, and from their territory
came the three wise men.
The Creator God
The chief god and creator of the world therefore was called ISTEN
and is still the Hungarian word for God. Today it is still used in the
neighborhood of Persia, by the Kurds according to some tourists. I
don’t know the circumstances of the usage, as it may be just a special
title there.
The IS-TEN word is based on the archaic variation of the word for first
& ancestor. Elso =As,es while first Os,us =ancestor.. as the ancestor of
everything, the creator. The word Iz/is can also mean fiery. Ten can be
related to the word TENY-esz meaning to breed, genetically
manipulate, ...create new life forms.



Other references to the name ISTEN for god found in Manfred
Lurker’s, Lexicon der Gotter und Demonen, Stutgard, 1904.
ISTEN or ISDEN in Egypt a god related to TOTH (scribe and wisdom),
in the later’s aspect as cynocephalus hamadryas./?/ In Hungarian TUD
also means knowledge.
ISTANU was the Hittite sun-god, the Hattic form is ESTAN (=sunday).
One of his main attributes is a winged sun as part of his head-dress.
ISTEN; Supreme god of the Hungarians. Among his attributes; the
arrow, the Tree, the Horse.
Other important titles of God are “creator”, TEREM-tö” based on the
root word TEREM, for creation, grow and flourish. Certain Finno
Ugrian tribes also use the TAREM word for the name of their chief god
of heaven. While linguists may still be arguing about the original and
common Finn-Ugor meaning of the root word, it is quite obvious in
Hungarian. The name can be found as far east as the name of the
Tarim Basin in western China and in India as the name of the Tree of
Life among the Dravidian language family. In Sumerian his name
Darama, was one of the titles of the god of knowledge and creator of
many plants, better known as ENKI. In the Middle Ages a variation of
this “pagan” god(?) DOROMO,DRUMO was made a devil by the
Christian church, all the more so since its ancient dwelling according
to the Sumerians was the deep subteranean waters. His son Saba
(Hungarian Csaba) or Dumuzi (Hungarian Damacsek) was also
retained in the early Pagan Szekely-Hungarian chronicle, as the god to
which Csaba prayed to before returning to Scythia with his Hun army..
In old stories god is often described as living in the 7th heavens, in a
golden kingdom. However he does interact with this world and he
sometimes hurls great stones to earth “stones of heaven=menykö, or
in anger may shoot his arrows down to earth “god’s arrow



=istennyila”. Fires started from such lightning bolts were the source
of the sacred flames tended by priests.
The best explanation I ever saw for the Hungarian name of God came
from Persia, which was quite precise and closer to the original
meaning than today’s Christianized form. It describes the perfect
unity, self generated, not constituted of matter but ethereal, the
uncreated creator of all. This comes from the archaic Yzdan-ite holy
book the Dab-Istan, a religion which is pre-Persian.
While the Hungarians of the 10th century were monotheists in the
sense that there was one god to which all was subservient, they also
had memories of more archaic times, and these ancient gods were
over time made to be angels, nymphs, heroes and devils, due
sometimes to the influence of their newer religion.
One of the most beneficial of the ancient goddesses was called by
several names:
Nagy Asszony meaning Great Queen.
Boldog Asszony meaning Bountiful & Glad Queen.
Baba meaning midwife, but also meaning God in some isolated
Hungarian communities in the Carpathians.(Csango dialects)
In the lowlands of the Hungarian plains, the mirage of the sun is also
called Déli Báb, the noonday BAB, the feminine mate of the Sun
which is typically translated as FATA MORGANA.
She was the benefactor of marriages, childbirth, agriculture. These I
believe were though to be the same, however they may have been
differentiated in the distant past. The term “Boldog Asszony” was a
predominantly associated with marriage and childbirth, and some



women in the Hungarian city of Szeged still worshipped her in recent
times after their childbirth and there are many folk customs associated
with her, including the birthing bed. Her day is Tuesday, when women
were warned not to wash or dirty the water. Apparently she was
associated with fresh water also, like the eastern Scythian Anahita the
source of fresh waters.
She was also associated with agriculture as many Hungarian folk
holidays of Boldog Asszony are agriculturally named, and have
nothing to do with Christianity. She was included into Hungarian
Catholicism to ease the way to conversion, as the grandmother of
Christ and today there are many hymns to her. In the east the
Manichean religion also had a pure goddess of Joy, called RAM-ratuk.
(RAMA=Hungarian OROM).
Historical association of the names show that these are early
Mesopotamian in origin. For example the goddess of birth and fertility
in Sumerian was called BAU meaning bounty, while DUG also meant
gladness. From this one can readily get BODOG, which also means
gladness in Hungarian while just BÖ means bounty.
The other title “Asszony” means queen in early 10th century
Hungarian. Today it means lady. This word also is most closely
associated with early Elamite, the neighbors of the Sumerians where
USAN (ref. DS109,L301) means goddess. The same word in Sumerian
of the Emesal dialect is GASAN meaning queen, lady (ref. G182). The
chief Sumerian dialect Emegir uses the term NIN for lady, which is
also still used in Hungarian Neni (lady, aunt..). The Accadians also
borrowed it as ASATU meaning just wife (?). Persian also uses a more
distorted form of the word, derived from the aboriginals of Iran, the
Elamites. Often linguists state that Hungarians obtained the word
from Iranians, who only got it from their aboriginals, whose language
is much closer related to Hungarian than Persian was.



In Babylonian mythology BAU was also the wife of Nimrud which was
a chief god at one period, hence the important Assyrian city of
Nimrud. In Hungarian mythology he is not a god but a mythical
ancestor of several nations, including Hungarians, Scythians and
Iranians, who according to Hungarian traditions lived 201 years after
the flood. That would make him a Pre-Sumerian king, possibly
Elamite. (Elamites, Medes, Parthians? rather then Persians proper.)
Hungarians including their neighbors all had stories of a mythical
giant ancestor (like Nimrud) to whom they gave respect. Finnish
Veine_MONEN while the Sabir Huns also had a giant ancestor. So it is
no wonder that when they became Christians the NIMRUD name was
adopted instead of the NEMERE name, which is often the name of the
wild wind in Transylvania. The original Sumerian NINURTA or
NIMURTA was also the wild southern wind, and the god of war. But
Hungarian Chroniclers sometimes called him by his Scythian or Greek
name Heracles, which the Romans took over as Hercules. This name
also is from the east.
The chief holidays of Boldogaszony, the mother-goddess, was
Christmas, which in Hungarian is called Kara’chon, a word also
borrowed by Russians, Rumanians, Slovaks from the early eastern
horsemen for Christmas. It means the new year, turning point of the
sun. However if one takes notice of pronunciation distortions then
Kara-acsony/aszony is another way of saying Nagy-Aszony, the name
of the Great Queen, to which the Sun God Mithra sacrifices the bull at
the end of the year, to free the sun. The earliest references to
“Karácson” is from Iran, where January was called “Karasanaj” in
early ancient references. “Kara/Kora” is root word for big in
Hungarian found in composite words only. (me- kora=how big).
In Hungarian Mythology Boldog Aszony had seven daughters, who
brought good things to mankind. In Assyrian/Babylonian mythology
she was called Bau or ANUTA, which was the same as the mythical



wife of Nimrud in Hungarian mythology ENETH, who also had 7
daughters.. the 7 days of the week. Whereas Nimrud ruled over 365
kings.. the days of the year as the Babylonian sun god.
TÜNDÉR
The ancient angels in Hungarian mythology became nymphs and
special aerial phenomenon’s under Christian influence. These are
called TÜN- DÉR. The word relates to the Altaic languages TEN-GRI
and Sumerian DIN-GIR.. the lesser gods of the Sumerians of
Messopotamia. The queen of the “nymphs” which were often
associated with heaven and wet places, mountains etc. was the
beautiful “Tündér-ILONA”, who often was represented by the swan in
Hungarian fairy tales. This could be a variation of the Parthian and
Mesopotamian NANA or Sumerian goddess Dingir-INANA, the
daughter of the Moon, who was the young goddess of the heavens and
also at times was warlike, and a seductress. Sometimes she is called
szép-aszony meaning beautiful queen, in Hungarian.
In Mesopotamia she was at times the wife of the god of vegetation
and shepherds DAMUZIG/SAB in Sumerian and Mesopotamian
mythology. The old Hungarian word for shepherd is CHABA just as in
many Altaic languages still use the word CHOBAN, which is SIPAD in
Sumerian. Dumuzi or SABA, was also the Sumerian god of the rebirth
of spring, and shepherds and is the source of the Hungarian word for
Spring TAVAS. (MU often changes to V in Hungarian) from the later
form of DUMUZI which became TAMUZ, in later Mesopotamian usage.

The Great Stag
The following essay proves that the sumerian god, Enki is Satan, the True
Creator of the humanity, our “Good God”.
This essay was written by Bobula Ida, Hungarian sumerologist and
linguist. She was the first one who started to reveal the the truth about
the Hungarians that our ancestors are the Sumerians. The enemy tried to
put her to silence many times...
A Sumerian Divinity by Bobula Ida



One of the elements of human culture which migrated from Western
Asia into the Western World seems to be the concept of a benevolent,
divine father who created mankind out of clay and who cares for the
welfare of the Earth.
The Mesopotamian divinity, who in contrast with most other male
gods of the early Pantheon, was considered benevolent, was the
water-god Enki. It seems that his cult was so deep-rooted that it
survived the fall of Babylonia and was inherited by many younger
nations, who brought it to Europe, where traditions which have come
down to modern times seem to be the still-living fragments of this
ancient cult.
Enki came to be known later as Ea./1 Ea’s name was written with four
strokes of the stylus; it seems that his holy number was four times ten:
forty./2 It may be inferred from one of the texts that he was
considered -at least in one period- the fourth in rank of the “Great
Gods”./3 He was supposed to be the child of Enlil/4 and the goddess
Nammu, the primeval sea./5
Enki was one of the first divinities of the Sumerian Pantheon to be
identified by archaeologists, more than 50 years ago/6, as the water
god, whose regular attribute was the spouting, overflowing vase and
two streams with fish.
The figure of Enki appears on many cylinder seals and other
monuments./7 Seldom standing -more often seated on his throne- he
wears the horned, high hat of the great gods/8, and often holds the
rod and the ring, symbols of divine power, which in Sumerian art
distinguish gods from mortals, but which are not special attributes of
any one god./9 His special attribute is a horned animal, usually the
ibex or mountain goat, which is often depicted together with the fish.
On a few seals a third animal appears in Enki’s presence: a bird which



seems to be the eagle.
Later the fish and the horned animal are contracted into one single
monster: the well-known fish-ram symbol of Ea, which has long been
recognized as a sign of the Zodiac./10
Many authors have asked: why is the name of the water-god Enki,
which means “Lord of the Land”? Frankfort answers: in the marshes of
Southern Mesopotamia land and water are so intimately mixed that
they seem to be essentially the same!”/11 We cannot agree: land and
water must have been contrasted even in the primitive Mesopotamian
mind. But Ki did not mean “land” only, it meant “earth”, too; and we
may presume that Enki was supposed to be the Lord of Earth. The
three animals which we see around Enki -the fish, the bird and the
horned goat- may well symbolize the totality of the animal world – all
that flies, swims or runs. Water is essential to the life of all of them.
The transparent symbolism of Sumerian creation myths makes it clear
that Father Enki was regarded as creator and special father of the
plants, too, who are mothered by many goddesses./12 Finally the
goddesses inspired Enki to create man, which he did – fashioning men
from clay, to be the servants of the gods./13
Being thus responsible for the existence of man, Enki was naturally
supposed to take far more interest in his creatures than any other god.
Enki organized the peoples and decreed fates for them./14 He taught
man agriculture, cattle-breeding and industry. He gave to mankind
“bread to eat”. He wrote all the fundamental laws of civilization on
clay tablets. These were kept in Enki temple at Eridu. He was the god
of wisdom, healing and every other kind of magic. In danger he was
the helper. He saved humanity from the deluge by secretly instructing
Ut-Napistim, the Sumerian Noah, to build an ark in which he
survived.



This myth, so reminiscent of the Biblical story, has led some earlier
authors to believe that the strongly delineated square in which Ea’s
figure sometimes appears is the Ark/15. Lately it is believed rather
that this square symbolizes Ea’s home in the watery depths./16
It is possible that the square connected with Ea- the square which
surrounds him or on which he sits- is the symbol of the World, which
in the Sumerian mind was something four-cornered./17 The square is
sometimes marked with a cross, a sign which is related to the number
40.
The most frequent divine companion of Ea is his Janus-faced
messenger, whose name has been read as Usmu or Isimud. He is the
man sent by the god on various errands./18 Another form of Ea’s
servant is that of the fish-man.
Often we see one or two gigantic doorkeepers19 by the throne of
Ea/20 ; these are called the twins./21
Enki-Ea had many names/22, one of them was Dara-Mah “The Great
Stag”/23. On this quality of Ea we may read numerous comments./24
This name of Ea was probably of astrological origin, connected with
his benevolent activities as helper of the Sun, his nephew, whom he
liberates daily from his mountain grave.
It seems that the Zodiac was the subject of early speculations by
Sumerian -maybe pre-Sumerian- astrologers. In the early art of the
Near East we find everywhere horned animals -stags, deer, goats,
ibexes – who wear between their horns the sun-disc or a symbol of it,
which may be a square, a cross or a sun-bird: the eagle./25 The
examples are well known, beginning with the pottery of Susa I.
Sometimes, instead of two horns, there are two animals flanking the
Sun symbol./26 If we ask, why is this motive so widespread, we may
suppose: because it was a message of joy and happiness. When the



Sun appears between the horns of the heavenly stag -ie. at the winter
solstice- winter is passing, the sun regains its former strength, the days
are getting longer, a new cycle, a new year begins. A disc or a bird
between horns must have stood for the Great Stag, bringing back the
Sun between its horns./27
The rout of winter darkness and the retrieving of the Sun must have
meant the greatest possible service to a more or less primitive human
society. No wonder that the cult of the benefactor persisted so long.
Helping humanity is traditional in Ea’s family. His son, Dumuzig -later
known as Tammuz and much later as Adonis – is the shepherd-god
who dies with the dying vegetation, but comes back to life, too, like
the plants. The epithet of this god is SABA (staff holder, shepherd
prince), which recalls the name Csaba of the young prince of
Hungarian legends, the immortal hero who always returns to help his
people. His plant has the power to heal all wounds, too, probably
being related to the evergreen Tree of Life, which is the symbol of
Tammuz.
[The source of the Hungarian name of Spring, Tavasz.m/v common in
Hungarian.]
Two Hungarian chronicles preserved a name taken from the ancient
pagan religion: that of the god DAMACSEC. This corresponds
obviously to DUMUZIG. After the conversion of the Hungarians to
Christianity, most of the legends which made up the Magian religion
of the forefathers, were discarded. Yet, the Csaba story survived. The
figure of csaba was smuggled over, from mythology to history, by
medieval chronicle writers, who rationalized the concept: “son of the
great Ruler” and wrote that Csaba was son of Attila, king of the Huns.
We are informed by those chronicles that the real Huns rallied around
Csaba, who saved a small group when most of them were killed, led



them to safety and bid them to prepare for reconquering Panonnia.
Arpad, the historical figure of the Hungarian conquest in the ninth
century A.D., is said to be a descendant of legendary Csaba. [Who
married a Chorezmian woman in Scythia] It is well possible that in
contrast with his father, Dar- Mah, the Great Stag, Saba was once
thought of as the Little Stag or goat which would sound as Dar-Ge.
This could account for later divine names in the Near East, like Tarku,
Targitaos [ancestor of the Scythians], etc; ultimately for the names
TURK and TURAN, this later being the land covered by the Norther
Sky, the sky of Carpricorn as opposed to IRAN, covered by the
Southern Sky (UR-AN), the sky of Leo. On the seal of the Kassites – a
people of speech and race which is little known but of whom
Moortgart remarks that they had many graphic ideas and symbols in
common with the early Sumerians – we often see a divinity who may
be Ea, or rather Marduk, the son of Ea. On these seals the Kassite
cross appears frequently./28 We see also in the art of the mountain
peoples, neighbors of Mesopotamia, horned animals defending the
Tree of Life.
Sumerian thought deeply influenced Greek thought. We may wonder
like the British editor of Lenormant- whether the cult of EA had not
something to do with the idea of Thales, that the first cause of all
things was water? May not EA have influenced the use of the word EU
“good”? [Hungarian YO] Had father Ea something to do with the
concept of a later EU-piter? [The Japhet of the Bible?]
On the peripheries, far away in space and time, a snake cult, or a tree
cult seems indicative of some cult of Ea and his family./29 But the
staunchest survivor seems to be the stag cult.
Indeed, the Celtic divinity Cernunnos, so ably described by Phyllis
Pray Bober, may well be one of Ea’s late manifestations./30 He is a
god of waters, like Ea, wearing horns and a torque (the ring, left over



after disappearance of the rod) like Sumerian divinities, and
accompanied by a horned serpent, which is probably a variant of Ea’s
horned fish. (The water streams of Ea, if they are carelessly drawn,
may easily be mistaken for snakes.)
The Celts, however, were certainly not the last carriers of
Mesopotamian traditions towards the West.
At the time of Rome’s decline, among the Eastern cults which invaded
the empire must have been the cult of the divine stag, and his father,
the divine bull (Enlil). Early Christianity found entrenched in Rome
the Babylonian custom of celebrating New Year or winter solstice,
with green wreathes, food and drink, song and dance, exchange of
gifts, and people enacting the heavenly drama in masks of stags and
bulls. The custom remained popular all over Europe. We have a series
of documents from the fourth to the ninth centuries in which Church
authorities of many countries forbid the people to have anything to do
with these pagan practices./31 Condemned and vehemently
denounced over many centuries, the originally benevolent stag
divinity became in people’s minds the devil, with horns and cloven
hoofs. This is why a diabolical stag, which leads its followers to
destruction, appears in later European folklore. Such is the Finnish
stag of Hiisi./32 [Hungarian IZ]
In a former study/33 I tried to explain how the Hungarians of the
ninth century could bring with them a wealth of Babylonian traditions
and the staunchly conserved hieratic language of the Magians. [Magy
ari]
It seems that they also brought along the cult of the benevolent stag
divinity. The chronicles state that the Hungarians in their westward
migration were guided by a white stag. According to the sense of the
somewhat cryptic national traditions, the great mother of the



Hungarians conceived the conquering duke in a hieros gamos with the
divine eagle – (the eagle of Ea, the eagle of Lagash?). Her name is
Emese. The corresponding Sumerian word Emes, according to Diemel,
is “priestess of Ea”./34 She dreams about the future: a mighty river
issuing from her womb covers distant lands.../35 Such a hieros gamos
seems to be illustrated on a gold vessel said to be of Bulgaro-Turkish
origin. We even find traces of the name Dara-mah./36 [A similar myth
is also found in the Mede myth about the coming of a new dynasty]
The divinity to whom these signs point, was, it seems, regularly
celebrated at the feast of Kar csony -the Hungarian word today for
Christmas – of unexplained etymology. It seems to conserve in its first
syllable the Sumerian GAR “turning” or “originating”. [Karacsony from
the Scythian name of January or Karasanay. It also can mean Kara
acsony/aszony= Great Queen]
About 50 years ago a special ethnographic survey revealed in Hungary
179 villages which observed the tradition of “Reg”/37 or “Reg”ls”
the pagan or semi-pagan celebration of the New Year. [in song format,
“Rig” means talk in Sumerian.] Gy. Sebestyn collected and published
in one volume all the variants of the “Reg” ceremonies and songs; in a
second volume he wrote a study on the probable origins and the
European analogues of the custom/38. The essence of this custom is
that on Christmas or New Year’s night/39 a group of singers go from
house to house in the village, dressed in queer costumes or animal
skins, often with blackened faces. They carry special instruments,
drums, sticks with chains and other noise-makers, with which to rattle
at the end of every verse they sing. They ask for permission to enter,
and if admitted, they proceed to sing their song, which announces
that God has descended upon the house, angels bringing a table
covered with food and drink amid a great light: now is the time to
feast! Most of the songs speak of a miraculous young stag, which
comes through the clouds, from heaven, and brings the sun between



its bright horns. In the song a lake appears full of fish, in the lake a
round island rises/40, the miraculous stag descends upon it and feeds
on the young reeds. In some variants, the stag speaks; he asks King
Saint Stephen (the energetic uprooter of pagan traditions) not to hunt
him, for he is not a wild animal, not a devil he is the Lord God’s
messenger! After this, the most important part of the song is a series
of blessings, which are all wishes for the prosperity and fertility of the
family, their crops, their animals. In many places the singers arrange
marriages; they mention together a girl and a boy who should get
married. The young people take this seriously, it is the voice of public
opinion. Every verse is followed by rattling, dancing and various forms
of the following refrain: EJ REU REJTEM! This refrain, which has no
meaning in Modern Hungarians, has been repeatedly analyzed for half
a century and many suggestions have been offered to explain it, none
of the satisfactory./41 The refrain may perhaps be a magic formula:
Ea’s incantation. At the end of song, the singers levy a toll on the
house; they ask for half of the cash the master of the house has, while
from the mistress they ask a bountiful gift of foodstuffs./42 In fact
they are satisfied with a much smaller gift, but the song may preserve
the memory of ancient priestly demands. Today the group of the
“reg”s” singers is usually a gang of young boys who keep up the old
tradition for the sake of the gifts which may be collected./43 But the
name “regos” points to an order of professionals which must once
have performed the ceremony.
The “reg”s” name of the old royal entertainers is fully documented./44
May we add that, while 179 villages have conserved the old custom
under its own special name, there are many more places where
variants of the ceremony exist under different names: for example, the
“turkaj r s”/45 or “szzgulyafordit s”/46.
[both names refer to bulls, cattle, the symbol of the great stag]
Sebestyen [incorrectly] brings up many analogies in the solstice feasts



of Poland, Rumania, and the Southern Slavic countries. While he
recognizes expressly that the center of the territory where the custom
still lives is Hungary, Sebestyen believes that the Hungarians inherited
it from Rome, in a complicated way, through hypothetical Avar
Slovene Szekely-Hungarians. This explanation is scarcely acceptable.
According to what we know of the Roman and the Western
ceremonies, these were but faint echoes, a masquerading carnival
with the masks of the Zodiac animals. The Hungarian ceremony was a
serious religious rite -organic fertility magic- called by its true
Mesopotamian name, which survived in Hungary only. It was a more
complete and stronger variant which arrived in Europe at a time when
the Western practice was dying. It did not come through Rome, but
straight from the East, as the last conscious ritual in honor of the
beneficent Great Stag god. Christian clerics made constant war against
the pagan tradition and called it “the feast of the devil”/47- in
Hungary, as elsewhere. Thus the ancient “Lord of the Deep” (the
creator of man) gradually became the Lord of Hell.
Stags and birds remained popular subjects of art. But the Sumerian
DARAMAH name of Enki survived only in the queer devil-names/48
DOROMO, DURUMO, DROMO, used all over Hungary to denote the
Prince of Darkness/49.
Such was the end of the great and ancient bringer of light. In the
decorative arts, the symbols of Ea live on independently. The stags
who guard the Tree of Life reappear, but people have forgotten their
meaning. The divine face goes into hiding, behind a camouflage of
flowers. Only the keen glance discerns in Hungarian ornaments the
round eyes, the eyebrows, the horns of the horned divinity. If you ask
the Hungarian peasant woman what she embroidered on her
pillowcase, she will answer: tulips. But look and you will see the
ancient message of resurrection, the horns of the Great Stag and
between them the disc of the victorious Sun.



_______________________________ 1. Ea according to F. Lenormant:
“dwelling, house” (Chaldean Magic, London, 1878, p 155). But in the
Sumerian mind “to build” was related to create, “to generate”. Ea,
“Beishlaf” F. Delitzsh, Sumerisches Glossar, Leipzig, 1914 p. 30. [Ea is
also the name of river in Sumerian much like FinnUgor YU,YO as in
fo-lyo=chief river].

3. Enki was preceded by Anu, the distant sky divinity of the universe
and Enlil, the “Holy Wind”, the violent storm god. Ninmah, the great
mother, goddes of birth-giving, preceded Enki, too. S. N. Kramer:

12.In one of the still not clear myths of creation we are told that after
a rather complicated process of impregnating a series of divine ladies,



Enki became the father of a variety of plants and trees. But being
curious, he ate those plants, which reminds one of the later Saturn
story. The goddess of birth cursed Enki for this and he almost died of
the curse, but then the great lady had pity on him and began to bear
again. That much is clear, that Father Enki, the personified Water, is
the father of plants, too. Kramer, op. cit. p. 57. [In a desert of
Messopotamia, plants are very dependant on irrigation indeed.]

17.”Four corners of the world” are often mentioned. We may have
inherited this concept in the four cardinal points of our compass,
which are arbitrary. In connection with Ea’s throne, mostly square and
bearing the signs of the cross we may recall that four strokes of the
stylus made a sign which Delitzsch reads as NIG, “something,
anything, treasure, possession”, connecting it with the identical
written GAR, “to be, to become” (Op. Cit. pp. 80 and 200). Fossey
gives to this sign the meanings: “four; to bring; to place”. (Syllabaire
Cuneiforme, Paris, 1901, no. 509). Diemel reads it as NINDA and
interprets it as having the meanings “four” and “bread box” (N. 597).
The same sign is explained by J. Dineley Prince as having evolved
from a square, with the meaning “building”. Prince believes that the
sign has two pronunciations: GAR and NGA (p. 110). The same
author explains an almost identical sign as “surround, totality, collect”
pronounced GAAR, but the name of the sign is NINDA. He explains
also the word NIGI as dwelling. The sign list of Stephen Langdon gives
a square as the early sign for “totality, universe”. (p. 294). R. Jestin
translates NIG as possession, treasury, luck everything: “toute chose”.



(Le verbe Sumerien, Paris, 1943, p. 395). His words for GAR:
“introniser, tetablir”. We may add to these data for consideration that
in Hungarian for is NEGY, totality is MINDEN and the great feast of
Ea, the winter solstice -today Christmas- is called (GAR-A-SU-MU)
Karacsony. These data belong to the already copious literature on the
“four corners”. /common in most ancient cultures/
18. Many years ago Lenormant believed that the fish-man Oannes
mentioned by Berossus or the Euahannes of Hyginus are identical
with Enki-Ea. (Freacois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic and Sorcery, p.
203). This view is still held by Charles Virolleaud (Legendes de
Babylone, Paris, 1949, p. 17). We must rather believe that the two
faced messenger and doorkeeper, the door incarnate (Iauna) is the
famous Oannes or later Janus, the divinity of entrance and beginning.
January begins the year, fight after the feast of the winter solstice
janus, the messenger of the water-god may be the prototype of the
later Joannes, who christened with water before the God-man. The
leader of the last pagan resistance in Hungary was called Janus, also.
/IA is also the Hungarian root word for river/
19.These reminded L. Heuzey of the later myth about the columns of
Hercules. Le. Sceau de Goudea, p. `33.
20.E. Douglas Van Buren: Symbols of the Gods, p. 46.
21.Talim meaning “twins or companions”. Frankfort, op. cit. p. 60.
These twins may well be the heavenly Gemini, or the first Cherub
angeles. KUR in Sumerian means “guarding” /becoming Cher- ub/
(Diemel, S. A., p. 147: Bewachung).
22.Lenormant’s reading of the name was HEA. On the names of Enki
Ea see Deimel: Akkadisch Sumerisches Glossar, p. 91. Among them
are: Dingir Magur “the god boat”, NUDIMMUD “creator”, DINGIR
KAR-RA-E and MUL GULA. In Sumerian times Enki, in Accadian times



Ea was the generally used name. It may be supposed that these names
were somehow related with the Sumerian root A. meaning both water
and father, or generation. Deimel, when treating this root, mention its
resemblance to Indoeur. AHWA “water”. (Sum. Akk. Gl. p. 1) A.
Falkenstein writes: ” ..vielwehr kommt der Zeichen E in der alteren
Zeit der Lautwert A zu...” (Die Sprache Gudeas. Roma. 1949, p. 25).
These suggest one more addition to the innumerable attempts to
explain the holy name JAHVE. Did not a very early common culture of
many peoples possess the concept of a god-water or god father, the
Creator? 23.DARA, DAR, TAR were in Sumerian generic names of the
swift cervidae, ibex, mountain goat, deer, stag, perhaps mouflon. [a
generic name in many language families for horned animals.]
24.”The ibex or ture (Capra Caucasica)... was also perhaps AYALUM
in Babylonian, Hebrew AYAL... The Assyrian TURAKHU is translated
Steinboch by Delitzsh. It is one of the names of Ea.. and forms part of
four other names of Ea”. Ward: Cylinder Seals, p. 416.
25.A pre-Sargonid god of fertility, worshipped throughout the land,
under a variety of epithets was represented everywhere in his warlike
aspect by the “lion headed eagle”. Cf H. Frankfort: Early Dynastic
Sculptured Mace-heads. A. Orientalia 1935, p. 105.

29.Ea was a divinity of the subterranean waters. Vladimir Georgiev,
the Bulgarian decipherer of Minoan inscriptions, tells us that YA was
the Minoan syllable expressed with what we call the Delta letter, and
which corresponds to Latin ianus, underground passage. (Inscriptions
Minoennes Quasi Bilingues Annuaire de l’Universite de Sofia. 1950, p.
21). The wise animal inhabiting the wet underground passages is the
snake. And we are told: the mysterious prehistoric stone buildings of
Western Europe occur invariably at spots where underground water
currents are meeting (Charles Diot: Les Sourciers et les Monuments
Megalithiques. Boug, 1935). Lenormant stated “that the serpent was
one of the principal attributes and one of the forms of Hea”.
(Chaldean Magic, p. 232). The snake of Ea seems to be somehow
related to Marduk’s dragon. The dragon in Hungarian folklore is often
called SARKANY-KIGYO “dragon-snake”.[which by the way is also
often assosciated with rain, storms, and fertility!!]

32.Hiisi is the spirit of the underworld, the underworld itself. Hiisi
rides a vicious fish, who swims in the waters of Tuonela, the
underworld. The fish tries to catch the souls of the deceased; he
makes himself a body of plants and appears over the earth as stag to
lure the living. Kalevala, 13th Runo.
33.Sumerian Affiliations, Washington, 1950.
34.”e. Priesterin Ea’s”. Sum. Akk. Glossar, p. 92.
35.Ea’s name may be hidden in the archaic Hungarian word for river:
JO (pronounced YO). The idea of “good” is expressed in Hungarian by
the word JO also. A royal edict of the XI-th century forbade
Hungarians to celebrate at rivers, fountains and trees. But a belief in



the fertility magic of water survived until modern times (East). [the
Hungarian Easter custom of dunking of maidens.]
36.Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos, Byzantine emperor and writer,
relates that in the X-th century a young prince of Hungary visited
Constantinople -his name was Termatzous. (M. H. K. p. 128).
37. The Hungarian word REG corresponds to Sumerian RIG, “to
speak, recite”. (Deimel, S.A., p. 191 Sprechen), also to Accadian
RAGAHU (Deimel A. S., p. 395 schreien, rufen, beanspruchen); maybe
to Sanscrit rk*, too -see Rig Veda.
38.Reg”s nekek, A. Reg”s”k. Budapest, 1902, Athenaeum.
39.In medieval centuries the year began on December 25th -only since
the end of the 15-th century have Christmas and New Year been
separated.
40. The house of Ea, the “mountain of Ea” emerged from the waters,
too. (Falkenstein, op. cit. p. 25).
41.The first word: EJ or HEJ -an exclamation- contains perhaps the
name EA or HEA. The second means: recitation. The third word:
REJTEM may be related to Sumerian RI “to protect” – UH “magic”
Accadian RUGHTU “magic”. The refrain meaning: “EAs recitation:
protective magic”.
42.In some variants the foods are enumerated: a large ox to roast,
hazelnuts for stuffing and Perec cakes to hand on the horns of the ox.
The perec is around hard cake, which has a hole like a doughnut and
recalls the torques of Cernunnos. (pretzel)

the ceremony in Vol. 3 of A Magyars g Nprajza, Budapest, 1938.

44.In a document of King Louis of Anjou, dated 1347. After the
extinction of the national royal house, bad days must have come upon
the former order of royal entertainers. The document states that the
former property of the “Combibatorum Regalium condicionarium
vulgariter Regus dictorum” the land called “Reg- teluk” is given now
to a comes Lorand. K. Szab ̆: A Kir lyi Reg”s”kr”l. Sz zadok, 1881, p.
553.
45.A group of boys go round leading ofne of their number in stags
mask. Many variations of the custom are described in ethnographic
publications.
46.The word means “turning the virgin cattle”. A group of men go
from house to house on New Year’s night and make a noise with
whips, horns and bells under the windows. This custom of several
Hungarian villages in county Zempln is described in Ethnographia,
Budapest, 1926, p. 89. We may read there about the custom of
Hajduszoboszlo county Hajdu: lighting fires and sounding cowbells at
New Years night.
47.G. Helta: Dialogus. Kolozsv r, 1552, Introduction.
48. The name is documented in witch processes: witches confessing
that they were in the “army of Dromo”. See also Ipolyi: Magyar
Mythologia. The variant Doromo occurs in a play of Csokonai:
Tempef”i. Listed as Durumo in the Magyar Etymologiai Sz ̆t r with the
remark, “etymology unknown”. (Gombocz Melich, Budapest, 1930, p.
1451).
49. B. Homan: a Hungarian scholar of German origin, contended that
the stag of the Hungarian origin-myths was a loan from German
traditions. ( A Magyar Hunhagyom ny s HŁn -Monda. Budapest, 1932,



p. 64-65). Berze-Nagy refuses to believe Sebestyns good guess too,
that the Hungarian stag is connected with the Capricorn of the Zodiac
– he tries to prove that the Hungarian stag was female, could not have
horns, and came from Eastern folklore and is of eschatologic
character; it originated in the IX -the century A. D. We believe we have
shown that Berze is right about the Eastern direction, but the stag is
much older than a mere 1000 years. Being miraculous, it could well
be female and have horns. We have pictures of such animals (e.g.
Scythian art).
