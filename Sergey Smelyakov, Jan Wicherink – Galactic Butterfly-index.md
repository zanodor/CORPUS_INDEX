THE MYSTERY OF MAYA SYMBOLS
AND THE EPOCHS OF CRUCIAL WORLD TRANSFORMATIONS
The sequel to [1]
Sergey Smelyakov, Jan Wicherink
Annotation
In this article we show that correspondence exists between the Maya artefacts pertaining to their Cosmogony and the Old World ones as well as with the Great Celestial Conjunction (GCC) [1] symbols and concepts. This allows us to conclude that the concepts of XX-correlation and GCC were also known to Maya and reflected, principally, in the same symbols.
Besides, one more composite symbol is considered which unites the basic concepts of Evolution which is widely used our days, but, nevertheless, has caused a lot of acute discussions. For distinctness, we call it the “Galactic Butterfly” (GB) – by the name which is used for this icon by indigenous people. Though its origin has not been established yet, it is shown that the composition and elements of this composite symbol reflect the esoteric ideas of Cosmogony that were the same in the Old and the New Worlds. In particular, it is shown that this symbol reflects graphically the idea of the GCC even in a more profound way than the 8-pointed Cross and evidently presents the “Mesoamerican” analogue of the ancient Old World Swastika.
As a consequence of the established correspondence between the New and Old World cosmological symbols and concepts and existence of intra-American esoteric Tradition we put forward the suggestion that the origin of this symbol lies not in weaving patterns, but in the Tradition being maintained by the Mesoamerican Initiates and, for this reason, the symbol GB was known to Maya Initiates as well.
Notes
1. For convenience of reading this article it is supplied with the Appendices which contain extended quotes and references the extracts of which are used in the article as the premises; for this reason some extracts are given without reference. However, the authors of this work do not share every conclusion presented in Appendices 2 and 4: partly because they exclude polysemy and partly because it makes little sense to discuss the concepts which are based on heterogeneous or questionable premises.

The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 2
1. INTRODUCTION
Maya artefacts. If the Old World cosmogonies are described more or less thoroughly, at least on the exoteric level, a significant part of Maya concepts and artefacts remains unclear or causes intensive discussions. The basic cause of this lies in the systematic destruction of Maya culture in the preceding centuries. Nevertheless, though the Maya beliefs and writing system differ in their form from those of the Old World, the principal Maya symbols and concepts pertaining to Cosmogenesis (including the concept of non-linearity of time, etc.) remain the same, even in graphics. Moreover, the Maya time count system (first of all – the Long Count) provides us with an exact numerical model that can be both tested and used.
Maya Calendar. As it was established earlier [Page 3], the Maya Calendar (viz. Long Count) describes Time not only exoterically – in the well-known linear models of various cycles, but progressively – in evolution periods that decrease in the Golden Section ratio, in compliance with their idea of accelerating of Time which corresponds to the Theosophical statement that “{the evolution develops} ... in cycles and on a strictly geometrical and mathematical scale of progression” [SD 2, 732]. This is apart from other facts that provide evidence of a high level of mathematical knowledge of the Maya.
End of Maya Calendar and the GCC. After then it was revealed that the end of the current exoteric 5order fragment of the Long Count, or Mayan Calendar for short, exactly corresponds to the rare Space phenomena – the Great Celestial Conjunction (GCC) [1] which takes place 4 times a Platonic year (viz. once in 6500 years). In that work it was shown that XX-correlation, as the correspondence of two Celestial Crosses – those defined by the lines of Equinoxes and Solstices of the Tropical Zodiac (TZ) and respective structure, but for the Solar System (Solar zodiac, SZ), is reflected in the Old World symbology by the 8-pointed Cross. Meanwhile, the GCC – the event of conjunction of these two Crosses caused by the precession of the Equinoxes – is reflected by the 4-pointed Cross.
Mayas and their neighbours. At the Yucatan site of Tancah, the murals “show striking similarities to the designs of pre-conquest Mixtec codices from the Mexican highlands...” (Sharer, The Ancient Maya p.413). Sharer also says, “Thus, as part of Mesoamerica, the ancient Maya were influenced by, and in turn influenced, their neighbouring cultures, such as the Olmecs to the northwest, on the Gulf coastal plain, the Zapotec and Mixtec of Oaxaca (west of the isthmus), the cultures centered in Teotihuacan and Tula (to the north, in Central Mexico), and the less well-known societies to the southeast in Central America” (Sharer p.20). So, ... there could have been cross-over of symbology ... and definitely was in other cases, e.g. in the case of the Toltec Quetzalcoatl adopted by the Yucatec Maya as Kukulcan [App 4].
Therefore, by taking into account that the Maya culture presents the basic interest for this study and the bulk of the considered below artefacts belong to it, in the further consideration we will use a collective attribute “Maya”. The more so that the neighbouring cultures have much in common relative to these artefacts and concepts. Nevertheless, while considering the artefacts which, at present, are attributed to other cultures we specify their origin explicitly. Besides, the term “Mesoamerica”, for short, is used for Mesoamerica itself and the adjacent regions of Mexico where the Aztec empire was allocated.
A scientific approach to study of Maya artefacts. The creation of the Universe and its evolution present a relentless interest to the “official” science. However, its conclusions rest on and are bounded by the interpretations of artefacts on the ground of the scientific concepts pertaining to the respective epoch. For this reason it is doomed to circulate within the sphere of axioms (premises) defined by these concepts.
Due to this reason the conclusions pertaining to the historical events were systematically formed, concealed and/or distorted with the use of a “scientific” background for them to comply various goals of the ruling circles, since the oldest times and until our days. By putting up this rigid statement we should like not to accuse historians or scientists in falsifications, but to emphasize a notorious fact that a series of “facts” or “events” which had been once “scientifically established” at later epoch were successfully discarded. We mean to say, that making use of scientific (viz. logical) approach does not guarantee, by itself, that the conclusion will be true, since any approach uses premises. And even if these premises are commonly accepted to be correct (e.g. that the age of the Universe is about 6 millennia, with respect to the well-known dogma), this does not mean that they are actually correct. This is true within physics and, in a definite sense, even with some mathematical theories.



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 3
Thus, I still remember how the manuals of history for schools and universities in the Soviet Union were changed, as well as the respective displays at the museums, almost each 5 years, after the course of the Communist party was corrected at the current Congress. And the same philosophers, who reviled cybernetics and genetics in the 50-ies, were sitting later, in the 60-ies, in the entrance and Ph.D.allowance exams on philosophy which the post-graduate students in cybernetics and genetics were to pass. Now, together with the former Communist party leaders, they teach us how to build capitalism.
However, this pitiful situation is not the propriety of the former USSR and its heirs. By returning to the goal of our study we feel it necessary to give one more, but very important example of use of double standards in archeology and anthroposophy. Most Egyptologists believe, and this is reflected in Books, Discovery Channel films, the tourist guides, etc. that the Great Pyramid was built about 4600 years ago by Khufu (Greek: Cheops) in 20 – 26 years. However, whoever was the builder of the Great Pyramid (GP), he was not Cheops (Khufu), and whenever it was built, it was not before 10 000 BC. Facts are stubborn things. Thus, even a brief consideration of few matters concerning the construction of the Great Pyramid clearly indicate [http://sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/great_pyramid.html] that the builders of fourth dynasty Egypt did not have the engineering capacity to erect the Great Pyramid (we do not have the capacity even today) and that this structure was used for a purpose altogether different from mere burial; e.g. "Silt sediments rising to fourteen feet around the base of the pyramid contain many seashells and fossils that have been radiocarbon-dated to be nearly twelve thousand years old. This evidence alone suggests that the three main Giza pyramids are at least twelve thousand years old". This is apart from the elementary logistics: try to calculate the amount of time, people, wood (for transporting the blocks by ships and on the surface) and other resources for cutting off, polishing and setting up 2.6 million blocks of stone (from 2 to 50 tons each). For more references and details See [Page 7].
Therefore, even the “scientific” conclusions that are obtained through a logical analysis of the material artefacts must also be checked for their consistence, or rather the premises which predetermine them.
An esoteric approach to study of Maya artefacts. On the other hand, there exists the Ancient Knowledge which provides us with a much wider and coordinated system of concepts pertaining to the evolution of the Universe which can be used for both numerical and semantic analysis of artefacts.
However, in the ancient cosmogonies these systems of interrelated concepts pertaining to astronomy, geography and other branches of knowledge were given in a veiled or even such a distorted presentation that it was almost impossible to understand the origin of their symbolism. This mean, in particular, that these symbols and concepts were masked and simplified, and almost always it was forbidden to discuss their meaning. For this reason the ancient knowledge was everywhere divided into two principal parts the esoteric and the exoteric ones. Under the penalty of death for divulging of esoteric concepts, they were transferred from Initiate to Initiate. At the same time, for the masses these concepts (relative to cosmology, symbols etc.) were given in a religious form – as mono- or theolatry [3].
It remained so until the end of the XIX century, when, firstly in millennia, Mahatmas decided to disclose some elements of this Ancient Knowledge, that once was common to the ancients – the Theosophy, the concepts of which were always known to a narrow circle of Initiates, but kept secret (under the death penalty) from masses.
This Great Revelation was presented to mankind through the assistance of Helen Blavatsky, who presented this Knowledge in “The Secret Doctrine” [3] and other works. In particular, she shows in this work the common roots of the basic religions, how the Ancient concepts of Creation were modified in various religious and philosophical systems, as well as the origin of the principal symbols pertaining to the Creation and Evolution and use of the same basic symbols in Egypt, Europe, Asia and Central America including the Maya.
In her works it is explicitly stated that Theosophy does not require an implicit belief, but invites us to adopt its concepts through proofs and verification. It rejects “supernatural”, but discloses the origin of inexplicable phenomena by showing the 7-planes of existence surrounding the physical plane which is considered in modern science as the only plane of existence. For these reasons Theosophy can be considered as a substantially wider world outlook than a pure scientific approach as it does not reject the use of logic and sciences, but proposes to use them; in particular – for testing and developing of the



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 4
Theosophical concepts whenever it is possible. Other theoretical teachings and practices such as esotery, occultism, etc. reflect the Theosophical concepts, but not as clearly defined as in Theosophy. For this reason they are not considered below, but the term “esoteric” (“exoteric”) is retained for specifying those concepts which, for millennia, were kept secret and were not exposed to the masses.
That is why each profound world outlook is still comprised of two systems – esoteric and exoteric. To this end it is very important to distinguish between the “Tradition” (esoteric or Theosophical knowledge) and its simplified version in a form of “people's religion”. The symbols and concepts of the former were transferred from a teacher to an aspirant and kept secret to the masses, whereas their simplified images and ideas were, as a rule, dressed in a religious form and intended for the masses; these symbols were presented in books, paintings, monuments. Therefore, if a profane (viz. not-initiated plain man) knows and uses a symbol, this does not mean that he understands its significance. From this point of view it becomes clear that the existing myths, in written and oral form, may bear the correct concepts, but, as a rule, are presented in the coded form – mainly in symbols and symbolic narrations. And here we meet the problem of decoding the Myths and symbol.
The existing scientific approach tries to make logical conclusions by treating the artefact images (texts) “literally”. But if we agree that they present the coded messages, this approach leads to nowhere.
At the same time, the Theosophic approach does not reject logical analysis, but suggests considering these artefacts on the ground of the revealed world-wide concepts and symbols. So, a scientific approach is also applicable for these objects, if we will understand it as a systematic use of logic in treating the fundamental concepts and their presentation in symbols, like mathematics does by derivation of theorems from axioms and, and physics – by obtaining formulae, with the use of calculus, from primal laws of nature.
So, when studying the myths or other esotery-like concepts and symbols the basic difficulty lies in their selection and verification (for acceptance). And for Maya heritage, from our viewpoint, the solution to the problem of decoding of esoteric Myths and symbols lies in correlative analysis of their artefacts against the well-developed esoteric theory. Keeping this in mind we come to the necessity to formulate
The Platform (premises and criteria) for Studying the Maya Artefacts and Concepts. By keeping in mind the blank spots in our knowledge of actual Maya Cosmogony [App 1], we are forced to make suggestions as to their Cosmogony and its symbology. For this, we put forward the following PLATFORM (Maya Studying Platform, MSP for short) correlating with that for the Great Pyramid [Page 7]:
P1. For the system of Maya (Mesoamerican, in a broad sense) concepts and symbols to be authentic and, on this ground, used in some theory, it must comply with the respective concepts and symbols of the once Universal Cosmogony, the basic elements of which are described in The Secret Doctrine.
P2. We must distinguish between the Ancient Wisdom of Higher Priests, who had no intention to disseminate, and widespread knowledge (or popular religion) presented in codices and carvings. From this point of view it makes no sense to estimate the level of the former (in astronomy, mathematics, and other spheres of knowledge) by the latter one (like in Russian saying: “if you see an elephant in a cage with the label “fly”, don’t believe your eyes!”).
Besides, by allowing for an enigmatic abandonment of the Maya lands in the 9th century and destruction of the Maya culture and most part of Maya codices by Spaniards, we can hardly assume that the actual esoteric concepts of Maya could be found on stelae; rather, due to the established cultural exchange between the American cultures and existence of international esoteric communications we can presume that the subsequent cultures (Aztecs – the most important among them) shared the same Cosmogenesis, but were probably less rigid in keeping these secrets due to their lower level of esoteric development or simplification of the concepts (like the Christians took the Cross for everyday use).
P3. By allowing the fact that the same symbol may reflect, but several concepts, in the further consideration we must take account for the Polysemy of the artefacts: different concepts may

simultaneously be signified by the same symbol; as it is said in the Secret Doctrine, there is a key for every mystery, and it must be turned seven times.



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 6
2. COSMOGONY OF THE NEW WORLD – THE SIBLING OF THE OLD WORLD’S ONE (Maya Cosmogenesis [Apps 2, 4] vs. the Secret Doctrine [App 3])
2.1. What Does HUNAB KU Stand For?
2.1.1. Modern Maya Daykeeper Hunbatz Men calls Hunab Ku “The Only Giver of Movement and Measure”, the Universal Consciousness and prime organizer of our Galaxy [App 4, 4]. With these and other attributes Hunab Ku cannot [App 3] stand for the “Supreme ALL”, or Absolute Deity.
2.1.2. In some way Hunab Ku is associated with the stars, planets and solar systems, as well as with the Milky Way as a whole. As far as from a perspective of our planet there are three “observable” levels of Spiritual Hierarchy [1] – those of the Earth, Solar System and Milky Way (Galaxy), which are also reflected in the well-defined physical systems, Hunab Ku should be referred to the Galactic level.
2.1.3. Cosmic consciousness which the Maya called “Hunab Ku” (“all of the Consciousness that has ever existed in this Galaxy”) is provided with such attribute as the “the Only Giver (“Sole Dispenser”) of Movement and Measure” – viz. of Time and Space (as Time is the equivalent for Motion, as Measure for Space [3]), to whom they also attributed the mathematical structuring of the universe. Inasmuch as they also considered Hunab Ku as the ultimate Creator of the Universe (the "Mother Womb" which is constantly giving birth to new stars and it gave birth to our own Sun and Planet Earth), we can resume
that Hunab Ku stands for the Demiurge of our Galaxy, or manifested (or second) Logos, or the “Divine Powers, who are the active manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are the framers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested Universe, in the only sense in which the name “Creator” is intelligible; they inform and guide it; they are the intelligent Beings who adjust and control evolution”; the Builders – “are the real creators of the Universe”.
Note also that Time and Space are the forms of the One incognizable Deity [SD 2, 382]). The Puranas insist on the identity of Vishnu with Time and Space (Vishnu is all – the worlds, the stars, the seas, etc... and the Rabbinical symbol for God is MAQOM, "Space"...[SD 2, 611].
2.1.4. So, it is clear that due to the high level of Hierarchy of Hunab Ku this Creator should have been “a remote from everyday affairs”, figure “little in the {everyday} life of the ancient Maya” and, due to its holiness, should not be exposed, as the ineffableand unutterableNAME, in exoteric sources (“in the codices or elsewhere”).
2.1.5. Symbols of Hunab Ku and the Milky Way.
i) The Sun as a star and the Central Spiritual Sun that stands behind the visible Sun – are two different things [1, 3]. If for the former the symbol is used, the latter is understood as the Logos of the Solar system which is too Divine and not cognizable for us to bear a symbol, as the ineffable and unutterable NAME.
In the strict conformity with this approach Hunbatz Men has never actually said that the symbol “Galactic Butterfly” (See Sec. 5) was Hunab Ku [App 4]; moreover, apparently with a clear understanding of the esoteric meaning of Hunab Ku, Men doesn’tstatethat Hunab K’u is the Milky Way; instead, with respect to the concepts of the Secret Doctrine he says: “The Maya lived integrally worshipping that which is represented by the “G”. I will reveal to you, dear reader, with all due respect for the sacred Hunab’Ku, from whom came my illumination and who enabled me to see it, the place of origin of this form. It is nothing less than our galaxy. Yes, the Milky Way!” [App 4]. Men also demonstrates that the Mexicas and other Mesoamerican peoples worshipped the Milky Way as represented by this symbol.
ii) Alongside, the same hierogram – , “the circle of Heaven” [App 3, pr.2], was used with a sacred meaning, as an indirect indication to the Architect. Therefore, it is quite probable that in this sense the following statement, if applied to the esoteric side of Maya Cosmology, is also authentic: the Maya



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 7
represented Hunab Ku “by a circle{marked out by the Authors of that article} in which was inscribed a square , just as did Pythagoras” [App 4, pr.2].
Further on, with the clear correlation with the concepts of the Circle (viz. zero) [Sp.1] and the Secret Doctrine Men continues:
“For the Maya, wherever the symbol of zero is marked {SS: note that Maya knew the number “zero” long before it came to Europe}, its value is known, for it represents the essence of the beginning, the Logos. ... In order to understand the sacred Hunab’Ku, the Only Giver of Movement and Measure, one must venerate the origin of the zero, the Milky Way, because it is there that the mold for the most ancient things was located” [App 4].
iii) This gives us a clear indication that Hunbatz Men, as a man in Tradition, apparently follows principally the same Cosmogony that is given in the Secret Doctrine and evidently separates the Creator (Hunab Ku) and His Creation (the Milky Way). Namely, these considerations show that Initiated Mayas (as the Secret Doctrine) had evidently distinguished, on the symbolical and conceptual levels, between Hunab Ku as the Demiurge (“ ”) and its “visible” image – the Milky Way, or manifestation of Hunab Ku (“G”).
At the same time “the circle of Heaven” was not only known to Mayas, but used as an attribute of Venus (See Para. 2.2.2) from where a Hierarchy of Creators had come to Earth.
2.1.6. In compliance with the Theosophical paradigm, Hunab Ku, as the Highest Hierarch for the elements of this Galaxy, “represented the gateway to other Galaxies beyond our Sun” [App 4, pr. 2.3].
2.1.7. The manifested or physical nature of the Galaxy was also well-known to the Maya:
i) Hunab Ku, according to the Maya, is also the Consciousness (viz. Creators) which organized all matter, from a “whirling disk”, into stars, planets and solar systems [App 4, pr. 2.3];
“In the earliest Hindu exoteric cosmogonies, it is not even the Demiurge who creates. For it is said in one of the Puranas that: "The great Architect of the World gives the first impulse to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in turn over each planet and body." It is this action "that causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun." After which action, "it is the Brahmandica, the Solar and Lunar Pitris (the Dhyani-Chohans)" who take charge of their respective spheres (earths and planets), to the end of the Kalpa” [SD 1, 442]. (Note: in the Secret Doctrine the creation of the Galaxy is considered, but in outline.)
ii) They also believed that the "Creator" directs everything that happens in our Galaxy from its center through the emanation of periodic "Consciousness Energy" bursts [App 4, pr. 1].
iii) Today, modern astronomers have verified that at the center of our Galaxy is a “whirling disk” with a “Black Hole” at its center that is both swallowing and giving birth to stars [App 4, pr. 1].
There appears to be a convergence between what the Maya believed and understood and what modern scientists are discovering about our Galaxy today. One big difference is how modern physicists view and how the ancient Mayas viewed “Time”. Today, physicists view Time as being linear ... In contrast, the Maya believed essentially that Time flows in a circle. There is a beginning and an end to things but there is a renewal at the end of the Time cycle. There is a “periodicity” to all manifested phenomena. The Mayan highly accurate Long Count Calendar is based on this precept. The Maya also believed that Time originates out of the Hunab Ku and is controlled by it [App 4, pr. 1].
2.1.8. It is very difficult to dismiss the Mayan Cosmology and Astronomy because they left extraordinary evidence that their "Time" keeping methodologies give extremely accurate results. Their pyramids like the one at Chichen-Itza in Mexico are precisely aligned to the the yearly Solstices and the Equinoxes that are caused by the precession of the Earth's axis as it orbits the Sun. The Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 8
Itza is essentially a superb and highly accurate Time keeping devise that never fails to mark the yearly “Precession of the Equinoxes” [App 4, pr. 1].
2.1.9. The ancient Maya astronomers accurately predicted the Great Celestial Conjunction at the end of the present Long Cont cycle on December 21, 2012 when humanity will pass a point of bifurcation. On this day, according to the Mayas and subsequent Meso-American civilizations, the return of Kukulcan (Quetzalcoatl) will take place. By taking into account of Para. 2.2.2 and [Apps 2, 3], we can presume that apart from intensification of the Galactic influence (“Consciousness Energy” burst though the alignment of the TZ and SZ axes), our Venus Lords may probably exert their influence in an “unusual” way.
2.1.10. The physical reflection of the esoteric concept of rotation (of all worlds) on three levels of Hierarchy – Earth, Solar System, and Galaxy is seen in the basic planes – Equator, Ecliptic, and Galactic Equator; and namely these three planes define the XX-correlation and the GCC.
Resume 1
1. The essence of the Cosmology paradigm of Maya complies, in its main aspects, with the basic ideas of the Secret Doctrine (relative to Cosmogenesis) and astronomy (as to the structure of the Galaxy).
2. Therefore, as far as the Ancient Maya (Initiates, of course) followed the concepts of the Secret Doctrine, they should have to keep their esoteric knowledge secret; and with the recent evidences of Hunbatz Men, we obtain more grounds to affirm that the Ancient Maya had two forms of their teaching: the exoteric, which was exposed to everybody in stelae and codices, and the esoteric one, the full scope of which remains unknown to the modern world.
3. Hunab Ku is associated with engendering of the “whirlingdisk” of our Galaxy that is “governed” from its centre (Centre of the Galaxy) from which it produces the Consciousness Energy bursts. Along with the three levels of Hierachy, this structure defines the basic elements of XX-correlation and GCC.
4. According to Mayas, Time flows in a circle, originates out of the Hunab Ku, and inseparable from Space. This denotes that the cycles (or spirals) of Time must correspond to definite Heavenly bodies positions. Apart from presenting one more evidence to the authenticity of the concept of GCC, it also provides one more argument in favor of the Auric Time Scale [Pages 1-3].
5. The evident geometrical images of these Maya concepts ( , whirling disk, Center of the Galaxy, unity of Time & Space, emanations from the centre, etc.) are integrated in the symbol of “Galactic Butterfly” (See Sec. 5).
2.2. Maya Cosmogony in Codices and Stelae Symbols
“Creation of the Earth-Sky is the central motif of Maya myth and religion. The Temple of the Cross at Palenque and other Classical inscriptions report the events of Creation, though in a condensed, sometimes cryptic manner. These sources do not always agree in detail {SS – from the existing point of view}. Nevertheless, they show a remarkable continuity in the Maya conception of the cosmos over two millennia of history” [http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html].
Moreover, not only does this principal concept of Maya Cosmogony [App 2] reflect the ideas of the Secret Doctrine [App 3], but their symbols as well; in common, they present an exact esoteric system of astronomical knowledge. Although, these aspects of their knowledge are known to us, probably the only source for revealing the esoteric aspects of their knowledge resides in the oral tradition which, at present, is opened slightly by Hunbatz Men.
In compliance with the Secret Doctrine, The Maya believed that: “The creation of the present world, the world of humankind, was only one act in an eternal cycle of birth, death, and renewal. The cycles



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 9
of the seasons and the stars in their courses are reflections of this cosmic dance. The events of Creation are writ in the sky” [http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html].
Even the existing Maya codices show that they were well acquainted with the general structure and mechanics of the Solar system and Galaxy. In particular, they possessed the Ephemeris for Venus, Moon and Mars (the eclipse, Venus and Mars tables), as well as the numerical methods for correcting their astronomical tables. This is apart from the accumulating evidence that other astronomical information and cross-references are hidden in the existing codices.
The following review shows that there exists a close correspondence between the Old and New World systems of astronomical symbolism.
2.2.1. Ecliptic
The celestial bodies are often shown suspended from a “sky band” representing the Ecliptic, the path of the sun, moon, and planets through the heavens against the background of stars.
The Ecliptic is also represented by the two-headed reptile (or sky band), the front head of which is almost always marked with the Venus glyph, while the rear one – with a Sun sign. Moreover, in Maya languages, chan (sky) and kan (serpent) are homonyms.
Thus snakes or snake-bodied creatures are often sky symbols. For example: - the Serpent bar representing the ecliptic forms the cross-piece of the Palenque "cross" or World Tree (Fig. 3); - although no astronomical tables have been identified with certainty in the Madrid Codex, astronomical symbolism, Skybands and what are likely zodiac and eclipse symbols appear in many illustrations.
2.2.2. Earth, Venus, Orion and Pleiades
In Maya myth, Venus is the companion of the Sun, and Kukulkan is most closely associated with Venus and presents one of the Lords of the pantheon of Venus deities.
The Venus glyph is a four-pointed star (Cross). Standing alone (Fig. 1.a) it presents either Venus or a lesser "star." With a prefix “chak” it stands for “great star” (Fig. 1.b) and probably refers specifically to Venus; the latter symbol – a cross surrounded by four circles – comprises the elements of the known
Venus symbol and resembles an eight-pointed star.

The “great star” symbol (in addition to a synopsis of the Crosses and Circles [Sp.1]) gives us one more important universal glyph : the point within the circle which represents not only the Sun (in carving it is impossible to make a “point”: this is seemingly the reason why these glyphs are presented as double circles). “... this first, or rather ONE, principle was called “the circle of Heaven” ... the point being the LOGOS” [SD1, 426]. This gives us one more clue that Venus was honoured by the Mayas for Her Lords.



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 10
The great significance which the Maya pay to Venus corresponds with the significance the Secret Doctrine (App 3) pays to the Lords of this planet and explains the multitude of Venus gods as presenting Kumaras, Dhyan Chohans, etc.
A remarkable example of Mesoamerican understanding of the structure of the Solar System is seen in Fig. 2, where the 4 inner circles (inside the band of dots) stand for the visible inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) while the 5outercircles– for the outerones(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto). At the same time, the band of dots itself represents the Asteroid belt. This is a perfect representation of the Solar System! Also the left and right side of the picture is separated by a vertical band of 9 circles, representing the 9 planets of our Solar System, or the numerological concept of time.
Fig. 2. This is drawn from a seal. The “O” is the universal symbol of consciousness. The central cross is similar to what is known in the Americas as the Cross of Quetzalcoatl [Credit to: Share Int., 1997, V.16, N. 4]
The orientation of the crosses is also indicative as they are tilted from one depiction to the other. It may represent the rotating cross of the Tropical Zodiac (TZ), the equinox and solstice axis relative to the “stationary” Solar one (Look at the left cross in the center of the circles and compare it with the cross on the right).
In addition the crosses are also depicted in the corners. The cross in the upper right corner is rotated with respect to the cross on the lower left corner, for both halves of the picture. At this, the different angles may present not only the GCCs, but the 1/5 of the Platonic year – viz. the duration of the Long Count in units of the Precession.
Orion, as in the Secret Doctrine, is of great importance to the Maya. Thus, The "3 stones of Creation" and
turtle (Fig. 1 of App 2) representing bright stars in Orion are the important symbols in Maya creation myths the symbolism of which resonate with the Old World ones. It is seen, for example, in Fig. 6 presenting the Egyptian Analogue of Izapan Stela 67.
The Pleiades, as in Egypt, were also honoured in Mesoamerica.
2.2.3. The World Tree, the Cross, and the Serpent
2.2.3.1. The World Tree. The World Tree (Figs. 3, 4, 8, 9; 1 – 8 of App 2) is the most pervasive Maya symbol of the creation and ordering of the world. It is the axis of the Earth-Sky which connects or rather associates the principal elements of the Galaxy: (i) the Galaxy itself (or its Hierarch, or Deity, being manifested by the Galactic Centre), as the system, (ii) the Solar System (or its Hierarch, or Deity, being manifested by the Sun) as the element of the Galaxy and (iii) the Earth as the element of the Solar System. Though other names are used for the upper levels, we can note that in the Secret Doctrine the “underworld” (or Avichi) is the earthy life itself: “earth is Avichi”. So, though exoterically they could speak about “Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld”, they had distinguished between the Milky Way and



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 11
Ecliptic and, therefore, should not have united the physical Sun and Galaxy in a unit while placing the Globe and Spiritual Underworld in another two ones.
For this reason the three Cosmic Centresof Maya – Galactic Centre, Sun and Earth – mimic the same conventional astronomical and esoterical centres of influence which define the outer influence in the concept of XX-correlation and GCC.
2.2.3.2. The World Trees at Palenque. In the Temple of the Cross the World Tree is depicted (Fig. 3) as a symbol of the Milky Way (and, hence, the Galactic Equator). Through the centre of the “cross” runs a serpent bar, representing the Ecliptic (Figs. 2-4, 7, 8 of App 2). Together with the sky band (viz. Ecliptic) it also presents the Cross of the SZ. On the dates assigned to centering of the world at Creation of the present era, the Milky Way stands erect at dawn, running through the zenith from North to South. It becomes the axis of the heavens and, thus presents an analogue of the TZ and, thus, – XX-correlation by relating the SZ’s Cross with the orthogonal Sun-Earth planes.
As a symbol, the Serpent had as many aspects and occult meanings as the Tree itself [SD 1, 405]. Besides, the Cross and the Tree are identical and synonymous in symbolism [SD 2, 588]. These keys allow us to reveal other meanings of these symbols.
The Tablet of the Cross illustrates the World Tree, which connects Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. It is flanked by the Palenque Ruler Chan Balam (right), who dedicated the Temples of the Cross group in 690 AD, and his father, the greatest of Palenque Kings, Pakal. The glypic text tells of the birth of First Mother and First Father, and the “raising of the sky” by First Father, the Maize God Hun-Nal-Ye.

The Symbol for Sacred and Secret Knowledge was universally in antiquity a Tree, by which a Scripture or a Record was also meant (e.g. the Tree of Knowledge is the esoteric or Secret Doctrine [SD 2, 202]). Hence ... the "Dragons (or Serpents)," symbols of wisdom, who guard the Trees of Knowledge.
So, the collective name “World Tree” assigned now to all New World Trees is the same Old World’s “Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil [that] grows from the roots of the Tree of Life”.
2.2.3.3. The Celestial Bird. Both World Trees at Palenque (Figs. 7, 8 of App 2) are crowned with the Celestial Birds. Their position over these Crosses complies fully with the meaning the Secret Doctrine denotes to this symbol:
“Examine the Mexican MSS (Add. MSS. Brit. Mus. 9789); you will find in it a tree whose trunk is covered with ten fruits ready to be plucked by a male and female, one on each side of it, while from the top of the trunk two branches shoot horizontally to the right and left, thus forming a perfect (Tau), the ends of the two branches, moreover, each bearing a triple bunch, with a bird – the birdofimmortality, Atman or the divine Spirit – sitting between the two, and thus making the seventh. This represents the same idea as the Sephirothal Tree, ten in all, yet, when separated from its upper triad, leaving Seven.
These are the celestial fruits, the ten or , 10, born out of the two invisible male and female seeds, making up the 12, or the Dodecahedron of the Universe ...” [SD 2, 35-36].
So, as the universal symbol for the divine Spirit is the circle, then these crosses evidently present the
sacred Ankh , or Venus (See [Sp. 1]).



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 12
2.2.3.4. The Serpent: this symbol is one of the most ancient ... and the general association of the Serpent with the tree ... the "Serpent" and "Dragon" were the names given to the "Wise Ones," the initiated adepts of olden times. ... that is why the earliest Initiates and Adepts, or the “Wise Men,” for whom it is claimed that they were initiated into the mysteries of nature by the UNIVERSAL MIND, represented by the highest angels, were named the “Serpents of Wisdom” and “Dragons”... ”. The Nagas of the Hindu and Tibetan adepts were human Nagas (Serpents), not reptiles. Moreover, the Serpent has ever been the type of consecutive or serial rejuvenation, of IMMORTALITY and TIME [SD 1, 404].
The same concept is seen in the New World: “Some of the descendants of the primitive Nagas, the Serpents of Wisdom, peopled America, when its continent arose during the palmy days of the great Atlantis, (America being the Patala or Antipodes of Jambu-Dwipa, not of Bharata-Varsha). Otherwise, whence the traditions and legends – the latter always more true than history, as says Augustin Thierry and even the identity in the names of certain "medicine men" and priests, who exist to this day in Mexico? We shall have to say something of the Nargals and the Nagals and also of Nagalism, called "devil-worship" by the Missionaries” [SD 2, 182].
... Everywhere the sacred serpent, the naga, and its shrine and its priest ...; in Rome ... In Greece ... The Cainites and the Ophites call it Creator ... one should also visit ... the Voodoos of Port-au-Prince and Jamaica, the Nagals of Mexico, and the Pa, or men-serpents of China, etc... [SD 2, 209].
Such similarity (between the Indian Nagas and the American Nagals) cannot be attributed to coincidence. And now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem is proven. It is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, that of the devil; but is, indeed, the (“the eternal Sun-Abrasax”), the Central Spiritual Sun [SD 2, 214].
2.2.3.5. Two Serpents. The trunk of the ASVATTHA (the tree of Life and Being, the ROD of the Caduceus) grows from and descends at every Beginning ... The two Serpents, the ever-living and its illusion (Spirit and Matter) whose two heads grow from the one head between the wings, descend along the trunk, interlaced in close embrace (Fig. 1 of App 3).
Note, that this concept is clearly seen in the two-headed Cosmic Creature (Fig. 2 of App 2), the heads of which are presented by our Principal Lords – the Spiritual Sun and Venus.
But the symbol of Tree stands not only for the Space: “...among the luxuriant branches of all those mundane trees, the "Serpent" dwells. But while the Macroscosmic tree is the Serpent of Eternity and of absolute Wisdom itself, those who dwell in the Microcosmic tree are the Serpents of the manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All; the others are its reflected parts. The “tree” is man himself, of course, and the Serpents dwelling in each, the conscious Manas, the connecting link between Spirit and Matter, heaven and earth” [SD 2, 98].
Explicitly, this correlation of the World Tree and two serpents with the Earth and mankind we see in the Selden Codex (Fig. 4), where the mythological birth of humanity shows archetypal Man emerging from the Sacred Tree (Compare with Fig. 1 of App 3). The two serpents represent Spirit and Matter (or good and evil) – the duality of existence, or the two poles of the same homogeneous substance, the rootprinciple of the universe.

2.2.4. The Cosmic Canoe, the Ankh, the Crocodile
Stela 67 (Fig. 5) is similar to Stelae 11 (Fig. 7.a) and 22 (Fig. 7.b). As the Deity sits in the middle of a cosmic canoe representing the Milky Way, we have to consider Him to be the Hierarch of the Galaxy (Demiurge) that is manifested by the Galactic Centre as the Central Spiritual Sun of the Solar system is substituted by the visible Sun. Hence, with His outstretched arms He produces the Greater Cross that can thus be related to the cardinal axes of SZ, whereas the Crosses in His arms to – to the axes of TZ (each of them is a cross between the 4-pointed cross and Ankh, or primeval Swastika).
By taking into account the ballcourt’s orientation [App 2, pr.3.2], this image reflects the idea of GCC.

We find a similar symbology with the Egyptians. In the “Orion Mystery” by Gilbert and Bauval we find a picture of Osiris standing erect in a barque on the Milky Way river, stretching ONE hand horizontally
with the Ankh [Sp. 1] in his hand (Fig. 6).

Stela 22 (Fig. 7.b) has much in common [App 2, pr.3.2] with Stela 67 (4-point cross and the Deity in a canoe) and the World Tree (two serpents, sky dragon or Principal Bird Deity); these elements, once again, mimic the considered world-wide esoteric symbols. A new topic here is the serpent headed rope that suspends the canoe over the waters and a parallel serpent rope which mimics “the Spirit over the Waters” (See Sec. 5).



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 15
Stela 11 (Fig. 7.a) presents the same figure on the background of the curly cross, only two arms of which are seen; we may suggest that it is a fragment of full 8-pointed cross, the curly ends of which represent the binary nature of the higher influence, the Spirit-Matter, or rather the two ways how this Higher energy could be accepted (for good and for evil) - and, thus two different ways: evolution and involution with respect to our behaviour. These elements we see, once again, in the symbol of Galactic Butterfly (See Sec. 5).

Crocodile. The Crocodile (Dragon) – is one more “international” [Sp 1] glyph which is found among the Maya Creation symbols; e.g. in stela 25 (Fig. 9 of App 2).
To this end notice the following:
- the North Pole of Ecliptic is allocated (Fig. 3 of [1]) in the centre of the constellation Draco which defines the positions of the axes of the SZ and TZ;
- ... It becomes the task of the fifth Hierarchy – the mysterious beings that preside over the constellation Capricornus, Makara, or “Crocodile” in India as in Egypt – to inform the empty and ethereal animal form and make of it the Rational Man. This is one of those subjects upon which very little may be said to the general public. It is a MYSTERY, truly, but only to him who is prepared to reject the existence of intellectual and conscious spiritual Beings in the Universe... [SD 1, 233]. The Logoi of all countries and religions ... had the aquatic animals and plants sacred to them, the ibis, the swan, the goose, the crocodile, and the lotus [SD 1, 353];
- the Origin (0° degree point) of the Tropical Capricorn defines the Solstice axis of TZ and, at the GCC, the Equinox axis of the SZ.
2.2.5. 4- and 8-pointed Crosses
The following review shows that apart from the above considered indications there exists a close correspondence between The Cross and World Tree [Ap.2] on the one hand, and the 4-and8-pointed Crossesof the GCCand XX-correlationon the other hand.
Long before European Christianity reached the Americas the sacred tree and the cross were widely known there. Thus the Maya World Tree rose in the centre of the Earth-Sky. About this centre, the cosmos was divided into four quarters, each oriented to one of the cardinal points, and each associated with its own sacred tree (Fig. 8). Each quarter is divided in turn, creating eight partitions of the world. The trees at



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 16
the cardinal points support the sky. (Notice, that this gives us a verbal description of the structure and cardinal axes of the TZ.)
Fig. 8. Madrid Codex. The 4 quarters/8 partitions of the world. (In Maya maps, east or west is at the top)
[Credit to: http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html]
Even more clearly the 8-pointed Cross structure is seen on the first page of the Aztec Codex FejérváryMayerin (Fig. 9).The General structure of this cross not only illustrates the concept of XX-correlation, but also reveals that the recurrent “renewal of the world” being specified by a smaller crosses placed in the sides of the greater cross takes place four times a “cycle” (viz. the Platonic year). This greater cross, due to its significance, presents the “immovable” (as specifying the centre of Space) cross of the SZ’s axes, whereas the diagonalcross– the axes of the TZ, which rotate(remember, that the world was considered by Mayas as rotating around its centre) around the former one. Besides, it is clearly seen that the centre of the greater cross (viz. the Galactic Centre) contains the source of influence that acts to the periphery, viz. – to the elements of the Galaxy.

[Credit to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Fejervary-Mayer]
On the other hand, the concept of XX-correlation in the form of the 8-pointed cross presenting a correlation of two 4-pointed crosses gives a reasonable explanation for the world tree emerging from the sacrificed body of the central Deity (Fig. 5 of App 2), as emerging of new “Suns” (viz. new “World orders”) at the successive points of bifurcation that are defined by the Great Celestial Conjunctions.
A similar structure associated with the Space is seen in the Hindu exoteric Pantheon: the guardian deities preside over the eight points of the compass – the four cardinal and the fourintermediate points.

1. The main symbols of Maya Cosmology comply, in their form and contents, with those described in the Secret Doctrine. These are various types of Crosses (the 4- and 8-pointed Crosses, The World Trees, Tau and Ankh) and Circles ( O, , , ), single and double serpents, Crocodile and the Celestial Bird, as well as complicate symbols such as cosmic canoe (over the) water, etc.
2. With the use of primal symbols Mayas accentuated the same Space objects as the Secret Doctrine Sun, Venus, Orion, Pleiades, and even the three Cosmic Centres (Earth-Sun-Galactic Centre) which correspond to the Space Hierarchy.
3. The Ankh, as the synthesizing idea (the Celestial Bird over the Cross), is presented in both Palenque Crosses and other important Maya artifacts. By taking into account that this symbol also stands for Venus, these Crossescan be relatedto the Lordsof Venus as well.
4. Moreover, Maya established the rank of Venus to a much higher level than those of other planets and made it actually equal to that of the Sun. This has no other explanation except that they paid the same obeisance to the Lords of Venus which the Secret Doctrine did with respect to their part in the evolution of humanity.
5. In Maya stelae and codices, as in their concepts, we see a clear reflection of the structures of the TZ and SZ, as well as concepts of XX-correlation and GCC, both in glyphs and conceptually.
3. MAYA AND AZTEC WORLD AGES
What is new in the Cosmogenesis of the Maya (which was not described in “The Secret Doctrine”) is the Maya calendar and the concept of evolution in the sequence of 13th baktun (5125-year) cycles and how it corresponds to new “worlds” or “Suns” at the end of each successive Long Count Cycle [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Calendar]:
“The end of the 13th b'ak'tun is conjectured to have been of great significance to the Maya, but does not necessarily mark the end of the world according to their beliefs, but a new beginning or time of re-birth. According to the Popol Vuh, we are living in the fifth world ... The Maya believed that the fifth world would end in catastrophe ...”
The creation myths of most Mesoamerican peoples included the same idea of successive “ages”: according to the Aztec Legend of the Five Suns, the world will pass through five “suns” ruled by different solar deities. ... In the centre of the famous Aztec sun stone (Fig. 6 of App 2) is Tonatiuh, Lord of the fifth sun. The pictographs about his face represent the four previous suns, and the way each ended: By wild animals, wind, fire, and flood. The glyph above the face, 4 Olin, "earth quake", names the current sun, which will end by earth quake. According to some scholars, each "sun" lasts 100 calendar rounds (5196 years) – nearly equivalent to a great cycle of the Maya Long Count, whereas five these cycles give a figure much closer to the “perfect” number 25920 – the harmonic duration of Platonic year [www.divinecosmos.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=145&Itemid=36], which provides indirect evidence of knowledge of precession and its harmonic keys.
By taking into account that Kukulkan (viz. Quetzalcoatl) is associated with Venus (which is also presented by a 4- or 8-pointed Cross), and the meaning [App 3] of the Tree, Serpents (Dragons), and Lords of Venus for the evolution of the Earth, we clearly see that this symbolism corresponds to that of the SD



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 18
and predicts the Divine Participation of the Lords of Venus in the processes that may take place on the Earth in this crucial point of bifurcation.
In a narrow sense, this means that the current Long Count that expires on December 21, 2012 presents not only the termination of the current 5-millennia cycle, but – by taking into account the concept of the GCC – denotes the Origin of the Platonic year, since only once in five cycles of the Maya calendar the origins of these two types of cycle coincide!
In a broad sense, this concept correlates with the SD concept [App 3] relative to the Root Races and how the current Fifth will terminate its existence – in a quake, as the preceding Fourth Race in the flood.
Resume 3
1. The creation myths of Maya and Aztecs include the same idea of successive “ages”. And it is very important that the end of the current, fifth, cycle coincides with the current Great Celestial Conjunction
of our present time. This means that the current historical epoch, 1998 ± 19.5 (yr) [1], presents the Origin of the Platonic year (P.y.), since it is the only epoch in the 26 000 yr Precession period when the GCC (that is caused by the Precession and takes place 4 times a P.y.) coincides with the origin of the Long Count (which repeats concurrently, taking 5 cycles to cover the P.y.). The resonance caused by the coincidence of the bifurcation points of these two cycles explains why the current age of 1998 – 2012 is so important for the Earth: the bifurcation epoch of 2012 may sum up the activity of mankind over the preceding 5 millennia, or even the Platonic year.
2. The correlation between the Secret Doctrine’s Root Races history and Maya concepts relative to the cyclic nature of Evolution allows us to presumethat the Mesoamerican “Suns” stand for the RootRaces, but, in a fractal manner, can present the Long count cycles as well.
3. Though we cannot say definitely how events will develop around December 21, 2012, the depth of the Maya’s ancient knowledge allows us to accept their Long Count as the actual cycle that was not revealed in the Secret Doctrine (the Doctrine does not reveal all the cycles intentionally, but at the end of the XIX century Helen Blavatsky warned that the XX century would bring very important events for humanity and could even place mankind on the brink of existence). If so, the “new world” should start. However, as far as the current governments do not show any intention to transform the world order with respect to the Laws of Karma, they will be compelled to do so by the Forces directed by the Earth’s and involved Higher Hierarchies including the Lords of Venus.
4. HUNBATZ MEN EVIDENCES AS TO TIME & SPACE AND NUMBER 7
The following extracts give one more evidence that apart from the written and carved exoteric artefacts there still exists an esoteric verbal tradition among the Mayas. Though we do not know the details of its veiled concepts and symbols, even the published ones show the systematic and close correlation with those of the Secret Doctrine.
Modern Maya Daykeeper Hunbatz Men tells of an ancient confederation of Native American elders made up of representatives from Nicaragua to the Arctic Circle. They have been meeting for thousands of years and continue to do so today. Before the Spaniards came the confederation decided to hide the Mayan teachings, entrusting certain families with their care. Hunbatz Men is an inheritor of that



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 19
lineage. In his book Secrets of Mayan Science/Religion, he reveals teachings that mirrorthe Hindu and Buddhist ones of astrology, meditation, and the centenary root of creation [Share Int., 1997, V.16, N. 4].
He speaks of Kukulcan and Quetzalcoatl, not so much in light of an expected return, but rather in terms of the possibility that each of us can attain the same exalted stage by treading the path of attaining knowledge. “To be Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan is to know the seven forces that govern our body – not only know them but also use them and understand their intimate relationship with natural and cosmic laws. We must comprehend the longand shortcyclesand the solar laws {these are evidently the Solar cycles: See [1] as to the Solar cycles in the Secret Doctrine, [Pages 2, 4] as to their properties, and [Page 7] as to how they are reflected in the Great Pyramid at Giza} that sustain our lives. We must know how to die, and how to be born” [Share Int., 1997 (V.16), N. 4].
Now add to this the following verse from the Esoteric volumes: "Space and Time are one. Space and Time are nameless, for they are the incognizable THAT, which can be sensed only through its seven rays – which are the Seven Creations, the Seven Worlds, the Seven Laws," etc., etc., etc. ...[SD 2, 611]
“Seven seems to have been the sacred number par excellence among all civilised nations of antiquity” [3]
“...Speaking of the prevalence of seven as a mystic number, among the inhabitants of the "Western continent" (of America), he adds that it is not less remarkable. For:
It frequently occurs in the Popul-vuh . . . we find it besides in the seven families said by Sahagun and Clavigero to have accompanied the mystical personage named Votan, the reputed founder of the great city of Nachan, identified by some with Palenque. In the seven caves from which the ancestors of the Nahuatl are reported to have emerged. In the seven cities of Cibola, described by Coronado and Niza. ... In the seven Antilles; in the seven heroes who, we are told, escaped the Deluge ...
The explanation of it becomes evident when one examines the ancient Symbols: all these are based upon and start from the figures given from the Archaic Manuscript in the proem of Book I. , the symbol of evolution and fall into generation or matter, is reflected in the old Mexican sculptures or paintings, as it is in the Kabalistic Sephiroth, and the Egyptian Tau” [SD 2, 35-36].
Resume 4
1. The existence of the same symbols and concepts in the neighboring cultures (Secs. 2-4; Apps 2, 4) that correspond to those of India and Egypt gives us one more forcible argument for accepting Hunbatz Men’s evidences; in particular – to the existence of the universal ancient esoteric knowledge and communications between the native American Initiates.
2. To a full degree, this Ancient Knowledge at present is associated, first of all, with the Mayan teachings, though it is reflected in Aztec and other Mesoamerican cultures and closely corresponds to the ideas of the Secret Doctrine. However, to a large extent the Maya tinge of this Knowledge is still kept secret from the modern science and mass media, but verbally, or, probably with the help of the secret codices, is transferred through the Initiates.
3. Therefore, the esoteric symbols and concepts of the Maya Teaching present a reflection of the universal knowledge that trancended into (and seemingly have emerged in) neighbouring cultures.

5. WHAT DOES THE GALACTIC BUTTERFLY STAND FOR?
5.1. The Mysterious “Galactic Butterfly”
Though the origination of the symbol (Fig. 10) which the indigenous people call “the Galactic Butterfly” is unknown and it has not been found among the Mayan artefacts, it is widely used throughout the world for the Maya glyph of the Higher Consciousness or Galactic Centre under the name of Hunab Ku [App 4]. For this reason, since the validity of the latter correlations is not proven, we will use for this symbol the former name (GB – for short); the more so that this name is evidently chosen not at random. Indeed, compare the following concepts:
“Butterflies are seen [in Mesoamerica] as ancestors returning for a visit to physicality [App 4]; “For the Scarabaeus ... has thus been made a symbol and an emblem of human life and of the successive becomings of man... This mystical symbol shows plainly that the Egyptians believed in reincarnation ... and existences of the Immortal entity. Being, however, an esoteric doctrine, revealed only during the mysteries by the priest-hierophants ... it was kept secret” [SD 2, 552].
GBC GBR
Fig. 10. Galactic Butterfly in Circular (GBC) and Rectangular (GBR) presentations
However, although the mishmash with the “formal” correlates for the GB to some extent is explained [App 4], these discussions have not yet revealed the origin of this symbol (unless we would actually attribute its origination to a spontaneous weaver’s fancy-work pattern); neither have they explained the phenomenon of its wide spread occurrence in the “New Age” circles. Indeed:
- it is not proved that this composite, obviously esoterical symbol, the GB, was invented by Aztecs;
- we cannot reject the possibility that the GB was known at least to Maya Initiates and used by them for esoteric purposes, but unknown for plain men or prohibited for use due to its divinity;
- we cannot reject the possibility that Aztecs, as a younger culture, has inherited this symbol from Maya Initiates (Sec. 4) or some other source “as part of Mesoamerica, the ancient Maya were influenced by, and in turn influenced, their neighbouring cultures ... So, though there could have been cross-over of symbology in this case, (and definitely was in other cases...)” [App 4].
That is why by allowing for these premises we are going to find the answers to the following questions:
1. What is the meaning of the composite symbol GB considering the related Maya concepts and symbols?
2. Whether this symbol was known to the Maya?
3. What object this symbol was attributed to?



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 21
5.2. The Graphical Structure of the GB
The principal significance the Galactic Butterfly symbol presents to us is its structure and “international” cosmogeneous and evolutionary elements of which it is composed. With this in mind we can propose the following interpretation of the GB:
1. The 8-point cross consisting of two different 4-point crosses:
- the upright cross, as in the World Trees, presents the cross of the SZ, whereas its curly ends denote the Galactic Energy of dual, Spirit-Matter, nature which comes to the Earth through the TZ-filter and can be accepted here, on the Earth, both for good and for evil; - the inclined cross, as the smaller crosses in the World Trees, presents the cross of the TZ which, as the prism, splits the Galactic rays.
2. The Central point – the presence of which could be concluded both from the convergence of two spirals and from the fact that the inclined cross sides increase their width as moving away from the centre of the symbol as it must be with a beam, – which repeats the Central point of the “circle of Heaven” [App 3, pr. 2] and thus presents the Creator of this Universe. On the physical (viz. manifested) level, it presents the Core of the Galaxy, or the Galactic Centre.
3. Two spirals as the principal two Auric series (spirals) of the Auric Time Scale [Page 1] that converge to the point, or develop from the point – with respect to what phenomenon we consider (evolution, periods, etc.) and reflect the system of periods in nature and society [Page 2] or Evolutional Time [Page 3]. They also reflect the idea that the manifested Galaxy, or Milky Way, presents the “whirling disk”.
Besides, the Maya belief that Time flows in a circle, or rather in a spiral, is close to the Theosophic concept that “[Builders]...work in cycles and on a strictly geometrical and mathematical scale of progression” [SD 2, 732].
Once again, these two interlaced spirals show duality of the Galactic Energy.
Moreover, each spiral reflects the Maya symbol “G” that is associated with the Milky Way.
Even at this point we see that the GB clearly describes the transfer of the Galactic Core energies in Space in cyclic spiral of Time. These crosses, spirals, and other mentioned elements denote the fundamental esoteric analogues. In particular, the combination of “G” symbol (Serpent), Milky Way (Water Depth) and Spirals (whirling motion) mimics the Ancient Mystery [Ap. 3] of Narayana (the mover on the Waters of Space) and Fohat that sets in {a spiral} motion the primordial World-germs,
4. The circular and rectangular versions of the GB.
The circular (GBC) presentation of this symbol reflects the “circle of Heaven” and Maya symbol “O” for the Milky Way. Besides, the GBC’s structure reflects a circle in which inscribed but the inclined
square presenting a symbol for Hunab Ku (Para. 2.1.5).
On the contrary, the rectangular (GBR) presentation of this symbol is lacking for this esoteric perfection (though even in this case we see a square – perimeter of the spirals – within a circle of the envelope of spirals), but evidently more convenient for fabrication. In more detail, this aspect of the symbol GB is considered below in the context of the Aztec culture.
5. The Galactic Butterfly as analogue of the Swastika.
The Swastica is certainly one of the oldest symbols of the Ancient Races [SD 2, 556]. There was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the Crossand Circle, the Swastica, was universally adopted ... One finds it with the old Peruvians,... in the catacombs of the New world, [SD 2, 585]. Few world-symbols are more



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 22
pregnant with real occult meaning than the Swastica... It is the emblem of the activity of Fohat, of the continual revolutionof the "wheels," and of the Four Elements, the "Sacred Four," in their mystical, and not alone in their cosmical meaning ... One initiated into the mysteries of the meaning of the Swastica ... can trace on it, with mathematical precision, the evolutionofKosmos...[SD 2, 587].
“The great Architect of the World gives the first impulse to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in turn over each planet and body”. It is this action “that causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun” [SD 1, 442].
From the beginning of man's inheritance, from the first appearance of the architects of the globe he lives in, the unrevealed Deity was recognised and considered under its only philosophical aspect universalmotion, the thrillof the creative Breath in Nature [SD 1, 2].
“Among different tribes the swastika carried various meanings. To the Hopi it represented the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it was one symbol for a whirling winds (tsil no'oli'), a sacred image representing a legend that was used in healing rituals (after learning of the Nazi mimic "whirling winds" the Navajo rejected the symbol).”[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika]
Notice also, that the entwined spirals that we find in the GB and the Swastika also represent the equivalent of the Tao symbol of Yin (female, centripetal) and Yang (male, centrifugal) energies.
So, we can conclude that:
1. The Swastika was known in the New World, at least to one of the most developed civilizations – to the Maya.
2. The general design of the GB presents the Swastika in several aspects:
- as the pairof rightand leftswastikas: if we divide each pair the curly arms respectively;
- as the spirals themselves: as the swastika presents the intersection of two lines with the bent end, so the two spirals that originate from the same origin.
3. All the above presented Theosophical concepts related to swastika are also applied to the symbol GB.
So, the profound symbolism of the Graphical Structure of the Symbol GB leaves us the least chance that it was “created” by the Aztec weavers as a mantle pattern for a doubtful festival not long before the invasion of the Spaniards. The more so since these “whirling winds” and the accompanying elements reflect the existing astronomical concepts and new discoveries (e.g. torsion waves) [App 4, Sec 1].
5.3. The Origin of the Symbol GB
A. The rectangular design of the GB is found in the Aztec Codex Magliabecchiano;.Hoopes went on to find that the codex shows variations of the rectangular design, and says they are "mantas" - mantles or ritual cloaks that were used in festivals - in particular, the festival of lip plugs [Ap. 4].
B. There is another name for the symbol GB that was found in the codices – the “tocalatl” (spider water). However, Elisabeth Hill Boone conjectures that teçacatl (lip plug) was misread by a scribe into tocalatl (spider water).
On these grounds it was resumed that the symbol GB was originally a rectangular symbol used by the Aztecs as a ritual cloak design, known as the Mantle of Lip Plugs. The symbol survives as a rug design being sold in central Mexico. J. Arguelles popularised the association of this symbol with Hunab Ku in 1987, and changed the symbol to a circular one [Ap. 4].
Consider more attentively the premises that led to this conclusion [Ap. 4].



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 23
5.3.1. The Symbol GB and Codex Magliabecchiano
As to the Aztec Codex Magliabecchiano we have three questions:
1. Whether the Aztecs had invented the symbol of the GB themselves?
2. Can we expect to find even an exoteric, but Aztec-composed (viz. non-distorted by an outer influence) description of a ritual object (as it was primarily a religious document) in this Codex?
3. If this is primarily a religious document, then for what purpose does it describe a handicraft pattern ?
Our answers are as follows.
1. Take into account a relatively short (about two centuries) history of the Aztec Empire, its decentralized structure and low level of Aztec writing system [App 4]
On the contrary: Part of the Aztec’s educationinvolved learning a collection of sayings, called huēhuetlàtolli ("sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals, most of which seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.
The Mexicas borrowed much of their culture from the ancient Toltec; To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture.
The Aztecs also admired the Mixtec codices, so some of them were made to order by Mixteca for the Aztecs. Aztec women even started to wear Mixtec clothing.
Besides, the Codex Magliabechiano is based on an earlier unknown codex.
So, if the symbol GB presents an artefact of esoteric knowledge, it can hardly be assumed that it was “designed” by this more than young and heterogeneous mixture of separate tribes.
2. Take into account that the Post-conquest codices were painted by Aztec tlacuilos (codex creators), but under control of Spanish authorities. Codex Magliabechiano is one of them: it was created during the mid-16th century, in the early Spanish colonial period. Based on an earlier unknown codex, the Codex Magliabechiano is primarily a religious document, depicting ... the 52-year cycle, various deities, indigenous religious rites, costumes, and cosmological beliefs.
Meanwhile, the pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives. There are few extant Aztec codices created before the conquest and these are largely ritual texts.
For these reasons it becomes almost impossible to suggest that the Spaniards, or more exactly the Catholic authorities had allowed to narrate in it the actual New World Theology which they systematically tore up by the roots; instead, it is more natural to assume that the Spanish censors were trying to depreciate the religious concepts; the best way for this is to transform them into jolly festivals; this is the old political cabal: If you cannot prevail some process – head it! Probably the same situation we were observing in the former USSR, were the religious holidays were transformed into official festivals.
Thus, it was prohibited (under various penalties) to celebrate Christmas; in particular, to install a Christmas tree. But many people secretly did this. After then, the authorities established the New Year holiday (which is close to Christmas) that became (and still remains) the most popular festival. So, should we conclude from the Soviet artefacts that the decorated fir originates from the New year festival?
Another example. With the aim to suppress celebration of Easter, Soviet police did not allow the youth to enter the churches at the Easter Night; at daytime, for diverging people from attending the churches it was settled the official (and obligatory for attendance) holiday of labour called the “Lenin’s voskresnik” (viz. “volunteer” Sunday work) that was timed not to the adjacent Lenin’s birthday, but to the current day of Easter; without the “honourable” Lenin’s name it was also timed to other Sundays and Saturdays (as



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 24
“subbotniks” – “volunteer” Saturday work), but these were not the festivals, simply a “volunteer” work. The Lenin’s voskresnik was always organized so that music was heard throughout the cities and houses, streets were decorated with flags, mobile shops were opened on the streets (it was important due to a shortage of foods in official shops) and it was encouraged that the “volunteer” work (mostly – cleaning the street and yards) to be ended with collective drinking. So, should we conclude from the Soviet artefacts that the day of Easter (as it defined astronomically) is a cleansing-drinking festival?
Thus, if the Spaniards forced Indians to adopt Christianity and forbad them to read and write, destroyed hundreds of books on astronomy, religion, and philosophy, and the friars condemned Maya hieroglyphic writing as the work of the devil, how should we have been convinced in the trustworthiness of the Maya and Aztec Codices that were primarily the religious documents, if all these post-Columbian documents were rigidly censored by the zealous Catholic officials that were bearing the full responsibility for any statement that remained in the issued Codex?
So, the codices that were composed under the rigid Catholic censorship, the Codex Magliabechiano among them, should not be considered as such which adequately reflect the religious and cosmogeneous concepts of New World peoples; moreover, we must presume that they are impregnated with various insinuations relative to these concepts.
3. For what purpose, other than for an allegory, does a religious (or ritual) document present a textile pattern of lip plugs or any other popular festival clothing? If so, something else should stand behind this symbol. At the same time, by allowing for paragraph 2 we cannot exclude a possibility that this symbol was intentionally or accidentally transformed from a circular to rectangular presentation; the more so as the Catholic authorities were well-acquainted [3] with the esotery.
As to the rug, mantle and Mexican blanket rectangular design several things could be said.
First, the household goods may reflect the esoteric symbols, but are not expected to represent the patterns for the latter.
Second, the Aztecs – the newcomers whose exoteric religion differed from Maya’s – could have started to pay less attention to the concealed sense of the GBC (if they obtained it from one of the preceding cultures) and, for this reason, they started to use it in their decorations and even simplified its graphic. In this case the rectangular form of a rug may reflect a preference of tradition relative to household goods. Besides, if you pay little attention to retaining of esoteric meaning, it becomes much simpler to damask a rectangular rather than a round rug. For instance, have you ever seen a round blanket or mantle, except of Hollywood?
These possibilities are quite probable. Look around: our days the young people wear the symbols of any kind and in any combination – the more complicated the better. In non English-speaking countries young people like to wear T-shorts with inscription in English; they frequently do not know (and do not have an interest to know) what it means. Why should we reject a similar possibility for the Aztecs who got in contact with a highly-developed civilization? The plain Egyptians did not know the secret of scarab and symbol , and do not know this until the present. As well, the plain Egyptians did not wear the cross or Ankh, though they were widely used by priests and depicted in frescos and carvings; afterwards, the Christians started to wear a cross and it was used to think that this symbol had appeared after Christ. And many plain men still think so until our days. A lot of examples of transferring and misuse of various kinds of symbols among the masses can be easily continued. Besides, we mustn’t forget the prolonged decline (since 820 AD) in the history of Maya and destructive invasion and enduring dictatorship of Spaniards.
Besides, why should we think that the plain Mexica (even the heirs of Mayas and Aztecs) are so welleducated in all these nice esoterical questions after a millennium of oblivion of rituals?
So, neither the rug design, nor the Codex Magliabecchiano itself provides us with the persuasive evidence that the symbol of GB was “composed” by Aztecs, the more so – by their weavers. On the contrary, the grounds exist to imply that it was borrowed by Aztecs from some other culture the esoteric knowledge of which was highly appreciated by Aztecs, and Mayas could be among them.

5.3.2. The “Spider Water” vs. the “Lip Plug”
As we do not see any important connection between the word combination “lip plug” and the geometry of symbol GB, consider the alternative the – “spider water”[App 5], the more so that it had actually been used in the document and it was very doubtful, that the scribe could make such a significant error in a codex: such document contained mainly the pictures and were thoroughly checked before issuing.
Thus, the original translation of the name of the symbol GB was “Spider Water” (not a “water spider” being definite type of spider). From a conventional point of view this is very strange combination of words if we are trying to make sense of it. But this is only true at first glance. Let us consider firstly the meaning of the concepts that stand behind these words, as it is said that:
“One has to learn the reason of a symbol before one depreciates it. The dual element of Air (where a spider lives) and Water is that of the ibis, swan, goose and pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and water lilies, etc.; and the result is the choice of the most unseemly symbols among the modern as much as the ancient mystics” [SD 1, 358].
Notice, that though a spider is not an aquatic animal (even a water spider, that resides in an air bubble), but lives in the air, in this case we have for it the explicitly specified association with water.
5.3.2.1. Spider. In some way the considered situation presents a striking analogy with the Egyptian artefact – a scarab. Due to its form, the latter one stands for the cross , presenting the first and the earliest Egyptian Tau [Page 7]. That is why the Scarab was a cosmological symbol for the high priests, and a sacred beetle for profanes. Do you think the situation has changed in our days? When I was in Egypt last year, a native guide explained us in Karnak Temple how stupid the ancient Egyptians were: “they thought that the scarab moved the Sun along the sky, etc...”. But we know that in the New World the animal symbols were not less widely used in the esotery than in the Old World.
Firstly, spiders are unique from the numerological point of view: unlike the insects [App 5] with their three pairs of legs, the Spiders (as mites, scorpions) have four pairs of legs, 8 in total. Spiders' legs are segmented and each leg has 7 segments; Web-building spiders typically have 3 claws on the end of each leg. Unlike the insects with their large, compound eyes, most spiders have 8 simple eyes. This makes a spider the unique animal that mimics the 8 directions of the 8-pointed cross and bears the sacred numbers 3 and 7.
The spiders’ ability to molt and to grow a new leg (if they lose one) reflects the concepts of periodical change of the World Ages and indestructibility of Space-Time (or Spirit-Matter) and inviolability of the GCC cycles.
Most spiders are harmless to humans; moreover, they are our friends because they eat insects. Spiders have piercing jaws (insects – chewing jaws).
5.3.2.2. Spider’s Web. The most known, or “traditional” is the Spiral orb web [App 5]. This framework has threads radiating out from the centre. Next, the spider will work from the edge of the web toward the centre laying down a spiral of sticky threads, as the paths of Fohat. Obviously, it reflects the structure of the Milky Way, as the structure of Zodiacs.
Some types of a spiders’ thread become stronger than a steel thread of the same diameter; this fact may emphasise the firmness of the Space Law.
The Funnel-Web Spider sitting in its funnel resembles the Black Hole in the Galactic Centre, as well as an Energy Tunnel that opens when the two Zodiacs coincide for effecting the Karmic corrections during the GCC.



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 26
Cobwebs reflect the continuity of Time-Space.
Young spiders’ riding with the wind on long silk threads reminds us about the interaction of the worlds in this Galaxy. Even the water spider living in a bubble of air held in the water gives us an example of multitude of forms of life.
Last, but not the least are the following evidences:
In the Mandukya Upanishad it is written, "As a spider throws out and retracts its web, as herbs spring up in the ground . . . so is the Universe derived from the undecaying one" (I. 1. 7). Brahma, as "the germ of unknown Darkness," is the material from which all evolves and develops "as the web from the spider, as foam from the water," etc. This is only graphic and true, if Brahma the "Creator" is, as a term, derived from the root brih, to increase or expand. Brahma "expands" and becomes the Universe woven out of his own substance. [ SD 1, 83].
5.3.2.3. Water. This is the universal symbol for matter (substance), Milky Way, Space, Primal Depth, etc. [Apps 2, 3] which we see throughout the Maya and Old World symbology. Besides, the second word in the term “tocalatl” (spider water) means not simply “water”, but presents the name Atl of Aztec god of water.
5.3.3. Spider Water
Thus the term “Spider [over] Water” presents, but from the semantic and numerological grounds, the same meaning as the graphic image of the symbol GB – the Spirit which enlivens the Matter:
Narayana, the mover on the Waters of Space [SD 1, 7], or
Fohat that sets in a spiral motion the primordial World-germs [3], or
the Spirit of God [that] was hovering over the face of the waters [Genesis 1:2].
As in the World Trees, once again we see two pairs of four elements: 4 cycles of GCC defined by 8 elements (legs for Matter and eyes for Spirit).
“...The expanding and contracting of the Web – i.e., the world stuff or atoms – expresses here the pulsatory movement; for it is the regular contraction and expansion of the infinite and shoreless Ocean of that which we may call the noumenon of matter emanated by Swabhavat, which causes the universal vibration of atoms ...” [SD 1, 84].
In other words, the “Spider Water” presents the allegoric concept (as it was used to do in Bible, Vedas, Egyptian papyri, hieroglyphs) that can be read in different ways – literally and symbolically:
The “Spider” (Galactic Centre) spins the “Web” (Zodiacs) over the “Water” (in the Eternal TimeSpace), through which it, who sits in the centre of the web, (Demiurge, from the Galactic Centre) rules over its “world” (Galaxy) by sending the threads of his web (by exerting its Karmic Correction as Foxat or rays) or moving through the funnel web (coinciding axes of TZ and SZ) and, at the successive moulting (at GCC), changes the appearance (transforms the worlds).
Even in a direct association the body of the “Spider” and its position on the web represent the galactic nucleus and the Galactic Centre (with a kind of “black hole” in the middle), and its legs – the spiral arms; thus - the structure of the Galaxy, whereas all over the world the element “Water” is associated with the Milky Way (“the great river in the sky”) and thus represents the infinitude of stars.
So, we can resume that the “Spider Water” presents allegorically the same concept which we see in the circular (and even rectangular) symbol of Galactic Butterfly. Moreover, both of these composite glyphs present not only symbols, but the excellent integrated image of Creation and the structure of the Galaxy including the concepts of periodical renovation in a form of GCC.



The Mystery of Maya Symbols and the Epochs of Crucial World Transformations 27
Resume 5
1. By allowing for the considered Maya concepts and symbols we can conclude that the composite symbol of Galactic Butterfly (in Circular presentation, GBC) reflectsnot a single concept, but an integrated image of Maya Cosmogony.
2. Most likely, the symbol GB was invented neither by Aztec weavers, nor by Aztec themselves, but inherited from Toltec or other nation. But due to the existence of Esoteric Tradition in that region in which the Mayas played an important part, we can conclude that the Initiate Maya knew it. In any case the GBR (and most likely the GBC as the original GB) can be accepted as the very important artefact pertaining to the Ancient New World Wisdom.
3. The Spider Water translation of the symbol GBC allegorically mimics the esoteric meaning of geometrical symbology of this composite glyph – the integrated image of Creation and the structure of the Galaxy including the concepts of periodical renovation in a form of GCC. On the contrary, as far as the reference to the Catholic-censored Codex in case with the GBR (GB in Rectangular presentation) is unsound, as well as the suggestion relative to the error of the scribe, nothing can be said in favour of the “lip plug” except a neutral thing that the image of GBR is used as the pattern by local weavers. However, it remains interesting to trace how this glyph became a symbol of the festival of lip plugs.
4. Apart from an integrated presentation of Maya Cosmogony with the use of the well-known “elementary” symbols such as cross and circle, the Galactic Butterfly contains the Spirals and two Swastikas, which rotate in the opposite directions.
5. The unification of all these universal sacred symbols in a single image of Creation and Existence of the Earth within the Galaxy makes the Galactic Butterfly a refined glyph and thus can explain the intuitive cause of the world-wide distribution of this masterpiece of the Ancient Wisdom.
So, the glyph of Galactic Butterfly presents not only the Milky Way as a whole (or integrally) as the symbol “G” does, but also its structure and principle of functioning (or differentially). For these reasons it can present a symbol for the manifested Hunab Ku as the Milky Way Galaxy. From this point of view Jose Arguelles has probably expressed his intuitive understanding of this symbol, or half-opened an esoteric item.
The considered attributes of the symbol GBC allow us to consider it as the most exhaustive glyph for the concepts of XX-correlation and GCC, whereas both its names (the Galactic Butterfly and Spider Water) – as the verbal symbols which reveal various attributes of the same Cosmogony.

Maya History 1
Appendix 1
1. A SCETCH ON MAYA CIVILIZATION OVER THE LAST DOZEN OF CENTURIES
An extract from [“Maya civilization” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization]
1. General review. The Maya civilization is a Mesoamerican civilization, noted for the only known fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas, its spectacular art and monumental architecture, and sophisticated mathematical and astronomical systems. Many of these accomplishments are particularly noted from the Maya florescence during what in Mesoamerican chronology is termed the Classic period (ca. 250 to 900), however these developments are also a feature of the preceding Preclassic (or Formative) period, and were continued on into the succeeding Postclassic. At its zenith it was one of the most densely populated and culturally dynamic societies in the world. The area of the Maya civilization extended throughout the northern Central American region which includes the present-day nations of Guatemala, Belize, western Honduras and El Salvador, as well as the southern Mexican states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and the Yucatán Peninsula states of Quintana Roo, Campeche and Yucatán.
The Maya civilization shares many features with other Mesoamerican civilizations, because there was a high degree of interaction and cultural diffusion throughout the region. Maya influence can be detected as far afield as central Mexico, more than 1000 km from the Maya homeland. Many outside influences are to be found in Mayan art and architecture, thought to be mainly a result of trade and cultural exchange, rather than direct external conquest.
What would become the Maya region had been inhabited since at least the 10th millennium BC. Settled villages along the Pacific coast appear from 1800 BC, which is taken as the beginning of the Maya Early Preclassic era.
The later Classic period (c. 250 - 900) witnessed the peak of widespread urban center construction and the recording of monumental inscriptions, particularly in the southern lowland regions. They developed an agriculturally intensive, city-centered empire consisting of numerous independent city-states.
The most notable monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the accompanying palaces of their rulers. Other important archaeological remains include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae (the Maya called them Tetun, or "Tree-stones"). Mayan Lighthouse sites have been identified.
Current archaeological work suggests that the ancient peoples of Mexico and North America were in contact over great distances for a long period of time. Through well-established trading networks the civilizations of ancient Mexico came to share basic customs and beliefs. The Maya forged strong political and commercial alliances with the civilizations of central Mexico. Through long-distance trade, luxury goods as well as pan-Mesoamerican beliefs eventually reached the Anasazi people of the American Southwest and Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River.

2. Abrupt abandoning of Maya Lands. For reasons which are still much debated, in the 8th and 9th centuries AD (the "Terminal Classic" period) Maya culture went into decline, with most of the cities of the central lowlands abandoned. Detailed monumental inscriptions all but disappeared. Warfare, ecological depletion of croplands, and drought or some combination of those factors are usually suggested as reasons for the decline. However, there is no single cause universally accepted for their decline.



Maya History 2
3. Spanish invasion. By the time of the Spanish arrival in 1519 it is generally accepted that most of Maya centers had substantively declined from their Classical peak.
Shortly after their first expeditions to the region, the Spanish initiated a number of attempts to subjugate the Maya and establish a colonial presence in the Maya territories of the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan highlands. This campaign, sometimes termed “The Spanish Conquest of Yucatán”, would prove to be a lengthy and fraught exercise for the conquistadores from the outset, and it would take some 170 years before the Spanish established substantive control over all Maya lands.
When the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Chiapas in 1528, they took the Indians’ land, forced them to adopt Christianity, and forbade the Maya to read and write. The friars condemned Maya hieroglyphic writing – the most complex phonetic script in the world – as the work of the devil. Hundreds of books on astronomy, religion, and philosophy were destroyed. A long and noble history was obliterated [www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/maya/mayaprint.html].
4. Writing, literacy and numerals. The Maya writing system (often called [Mayan hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] from a superficial resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian writing) was a combination of phonetic symbols and logograms. It is most often classified as a logographic or (more properly) a logosyllabic writing system, in which syllabic signs play a significant role. It is the only writing system of the Pre-Columbian New World which is known to completely represent the spoken language of its community.
A linguistic study on the vocabulary of ancient (time) reckoning terms of both the Maya and Egyptians, shows striking similaraties in terms of glyph names, significance and associated concepts. It’s an indication that both cultures may have been in contact with each other. [www.earthmatrix.com/linguistic/maya-glyph-kemi.pdf]
Since its inception, the Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, peaking during the Maya Classical Period (c. 200 - 900 AD). Although many Maya centers went into decline (or were completely abandoned) during or after this period, the skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted amongst segments of the population, and the early Spanish conquistadores knew of individuals who could still read and write the script.
At a rough estimate, around 10,000 individual texts have so far been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramic pottery. Maya civilization also produced numerous texts using the bark of certain trees in a "book-format", called a codex. Shortly after the conquest, all of these latter which could be found were ordered to be burnt and destroyed by zealous Spanish priests, notably Bishop Diego de Landa. Out of these Maya codices, only three reasonably-intact examples are known to have survived through to the present day. These are now known as the Madrid, Dresden, and Paris codices. A few pages survive from a fourth, the Grolier codex, whose authenticity is sometimes disputed, but mostly is held to be genuine.
The decipherment and recovery of the now-lost knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs came starting in the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts to a large extent, and recent field work continues to further illuminate the content.
In reference to the few extant Maya writings, Michael D. Coe, a prominent linguist and epigrapher at Yale University stated: "[O]ur knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to



Maya History 3
be based upon three prayer books and 'Pilgrim's Progress')." (Michael D. Coe, The Maya, London: Thames and Hudson, 4th ed., 1987, p. 161.)
Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing is from stelae and other stone inscriptions from Maya sites, many of which were already abandoned before the Spanish arrived.
Although the archaeological record does not provide examples, Maya art shows that writing was done with brushes made with animal hair and quills. Codex-style writing was usually done in black ink with red highlights, giving rise to the Aztec name for the Maya territory as the "land of red and black".
In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) and base 5 numbering system (see Maya numerals). Also, they independently developed the concept of zero by 357 AD (Europeans did not import the zero concept until the 12th century from India.). Inscriptions show them on occasion working with sums up to the hundreds of millions and dates so large it would take several lines just to represent it.
5. Astronomy and Religion. They produced extremely accurate astronomical observations; their charts of the movements of the moon and planets are equal or superior to those of any other civilization working from naked eye observation.
Uniquely, the Mayan's appear to be the only pre-telescopic civilization to evidence knowledge of the Orion Nebula as being fuzzy, i.e. not a stellar pin-point. The information which supports this theory comes from a folk tale that deals with the Orion constellation's part of the sky. Their traditional hearths include in their middle a smudge of glowing fire that corresponds with the Orion nebula. This is a significant clue to support the idea that the Mayan's detected a diffuse area of the sky contrary to the pin points of stars before the telescope was invented.
The Maya's were very interested in Zenial Passages, the time when the sun passes directly overhead. The latitude of most of their cities being below the tropic of cancer, these Zenial Passages would occur twice a year equidistant from the solstice. To represent this position of the sun overhead, the Mayan's had a god named Diving God.
The Dresden Codex contains the highest concentration of astronomical phenomena observations and calculations of any of the surviving texts and it appears that the data in this codex is only of an astronomical nature. Examination and analysis of this codex reveals that Venus is the most important astronomical object to the Mayans, even more important to them than the sun.
Like the Aztec and Inca who came to power later, the Maya believed in a cyclical nature of time. The rituals and ceremonies were very closely associated with celestial/terrestrial cycles which they observed and inscribed as separate calendars. The Maya shaman had the job of interpreting these cycles and giving a prophetic outlook on the future or past based on the number relations of all their calendars.
Much of the Maya religious tradition is still not understood by scholars, but it is known that the Maya, like most pre-modern societies, believed that the cosmos has three major planes, the underworld, the sky, and the earth.
Philosophically, the Maya believed that knowing the past meant knowing the cyclical influences that create the present, and by knowing the influences of the present one can see the cyclical influences of the future.

Unmasking the Maya [www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/maya/PastPage1.html]
When the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Chiapas in 1528, they took the Indians’ land, forced them to adopt Christianity, and forbade the Maya to read and write The friars condemned Maya hieroglyphic writing – the most complex phonetic script in the world – as the work of the devil. Hundreds of books on astronomy, religion, and philosophy were destroyed. A long and noble history was obliterated. Few Maya today are aware of their Pre-Columbian past. After 500 years of silence, Sna Jtz’ibajom is reviving the literary and cultural legacy of their ancestors, preserving the history of their “FathersMothers” for future generations.
Hunab Ku & the Maya, In Lak'ech
[http://2012.tribe.net/thread/fb0eedeb-124b-4b1a-a93b-bd167201e98e]
August 19, 2006
It is important to understand the deeper elements of symbolism when looking at a symbol as profound as the "Hunab Ku". It is a composite of elements including spirals, 'steps', polarity, four/eight directions, symbols of ascension, and then the combining of these elements to create something far more. All the elements are already in other symbolism of much of the Americas, and all the elements can be seen carved in stone at various sacred sites around Mexico. WhetherthissymbolisofMayanorother culture's origin is partly missing the point, because it is in the unification of the elements describedthatanimportantsetofteachingsisencoded,andtheviewerisencouragedtofindout more.It is a veritable 'medicine wheel' in itself.
As Hunbatz teaches {See App 4}, the mantras and symbols are teachings. Ku'ku'lkan is a teaching about the duality, the number four, vibration and the serpent energy. It is much more than just a name. In the East there were the Kumara, another group of profound mantras, well known to Mayan esoteric folk...
The word 'Maya' means Ma - meaning Mother, and Ya (from the verb Yaxche) meaning seperate from. As agreed by the meeting between Hunbatz and Tibetan Lamas, 'Maya' is a teaching in itself. It teaches about the 'illusion' of separation from the Mother. Hunbatz' research revealed the Cara Maya in Greece and the Naga Maya in India, and he asserts that the Maya were teachers in many places.
In all the histories of esoteric art and symbolism, the initiates were taught about essential truths and then sent (or allowed) to visit places and structures where they would learn more. They would have to report back to the group/school/teacher on what they found. Some symbols were initiatory in themselves, and many who have meditated with stellae will testify to energies contained within stones.
And what so many conveniently forget is that thousands of sacred texts, scrolls, even stellae, were deliberately destroyed by the Spanish and thousands of traditional peoples, their priests, shamans and elders, were murdered for nothing more than 'being Mayan'. How can anyone expect much information to survive and be available for examination now after so much destruction and genocide? And De Landa and his cronies baptised and murdered hundreds at a time, to the extent that De Landa was recalled to Spain, repented and then came back to Mexico to write (badly) about the people he helped to almost wipe out. It's like Julius Ceasar writing about the Druids, Hitler writing about the Jews, British missionaries writing about 'Africa', and colonial US people writing about Native Americans!



Maya History 5
As for the Maya and their connection to the rest of Mexican cultures, it is beyond doubt that the Olmec were inhabiting an area which extended at least from southern Guatemala up into areas of central Mexico. The sites that they constructed were even built upon by subsequent cultures. They came and went, as their given name actually signifies. The Maya inhabited the more southern area that the Olmec previously occupied, while other groups occupied other parts of what was also Olmec territory.
There is much nonsense by the archeological posse about the Olmec, including that they had no metal which is contradicted by the fact that they created such perfect sculptures in hard stone. I have seen unoxidised metal found in an Olmec site showing very clearly that they did have metal and could easily have made tools for carving. And as the Olmec came and went, as artists they would never have dreamt of conveniently leaving their tools behind, for future archeologists to find! ...
My point is that there is so much rubbish being written about and suggested by archeologists and anthropologists (mostly for the sake of 'funding'), that it is easy to miss the truth when sourcing information from such groups. An ex-paymaster general of INAH told me that there are huge warehouses the size of aircraft hangars (in Edo. de Mex.), full of millions of artifacts which may never be shown, often because they do not fit the consensus models. ...
With only 10% of Nah Chan (Palenque) excavated, how can anyone say that they 'know' about such an extensive site. There is a very long way to go before many such sites and their cultures are properly understood.
It is well known in traditional groups in Mexico is that there were many sacred centres which were used by all the cultures.
Malinalco has an Aztec temple site, but on the hills above is a huge unexcavated city which long predates the Aztec. The word 'malinalli' describes the 'serpent energy' and is an indication of the initiatory centre and its power. Various people have told me about how lords and priests from different cultures were trained there.
Similarly there were places known to all the groups; places of initiations, specific ceremonies, big meetings, shamanistic training, priestly training. Xochicalco was a place of periodic meetings of peoples from all over the continent. It was like a 'U.N' of the Americas!
Mexico wasneveragroupofisolatedcultures, competing with each other all the time, as some people suggest. ...
What is certain is that during solstices and equinoxes, the thousands of sites across the region were full of ceremonial people, burning copal, chanting, dancing, playing music, etc and that this practice extended into the whole continent. Just imagine the intense energy of so many people celebrating simultaneously!
...
Please do not look for information about Mexican civilisations only in books and archeological papers. Truth is to be found on all levels and from all possible sources. How else can we make up for the loss of so much important text? Archeology will also become a spiritual pursuit, and will involve training in the receiving of information from elementals and 'spirits', as well as journeying in trance and out-of-body states. This will require students to be highly initiated and open to working in energy body states, as well as with altars and ceremony. There is more truth to be found outside of books, however valuable they are. It seems to me to be very important not to judge cultures by the available information, and not to draw many conclusions that are not confirmed with the people in the traditions now. They are mostly open to be consulted.
And I say this with great respect for the dedication, time, and effort that so many have applied to the studies so far. Although incomplete, the body of knowledge is commendable.



Maya History 6
August 22, 2006
The Maya are much older than the archaeological posse want folk to think. Quirigua shows (as does Chichen Itza) 2 layers of previous constructions under the main surface ones.
Mexico has examples of far older cultures which have been proven at various sites. The findings of VirginiaSteenMacintyrein the Zona Volcanica in Puebla state, back in the '60s, using carbon, uranium and zircon dating showed a date of at least 120,000 years old on a leaf point embedded in a tigers jaw (partially fossilized). She lost her job and funding and was refused work in dating systems from then on. Her assistant said 20,000 years and got promotion. Talk about corruption!
The original dating of the exacavators of the pavement around the temple at Cuicuilco is far older than the present consensus allows, and showed (via carbon dating) layers of volcanic ash and human activity going back many thousands of years, perhaps as much as 17,000 years. The work has been dismissed and the archaeological debunking conspiracy has gone on retaining the 'Injuns came over the land bridge from Alaska' theory. It is another example of 'experts' who either can't bear to be found out to have been wrong, or are deliberately working to debunk and hide the truth from the public (or even both!).
Charles Hapgood showed the maps of the Turks and others, which identified even the Antarctic thousands of years before it was mapped with sonar. Why isn't this FACT written about extensively?
October 13, 2006
As the wise Elders of many cultures have experienced repeatedly, the imperialism continues long after conquest and even after independence. It is in the form of archaeologists and anthropologists with their robbery of artifacts, 'dating' of peoples, claims and counter-claims, etc.
This endless preoccupation with what some people did hundreds of years ago is the same as going on at young Germans about the Nazis. Sadly the abuse of Native Americans continues today, after hundreds of years of genocide and imperialism, and as is so often the case, the abusers have written much of the history of the abused!
The debunkers in archaeology have the job of making the abused cultures seem less than they were, present false data and 'evidence' from 'experts' to support their claims, and of disputing the dating and information of anyone who goes against the 'consensus' view.
October 14, 2006
The Spanish killed hundreds thousands of Mayans and burned many thousands of Mayan documents. It is therefore absolutely impossible to know whether the Maya were using this symbol or not, whatever 'wiki' says and whatever the archaeological community say. Anyone who claims that they know what information was destroyed is making it up! You do not have "an accurate historical context" because the greater body of evidence was destroyed hundreds of years ago, which means that you are mistaken in your suposition.
I repeat, no one can know the exact roots of this symbol because most of the Mayan texts were destroyed. Any reference to this symbol is from whatever was left after the destruction. Therefore you do not know and so to suggest that only 'scholarship' will prove anything, is nonsense and the real "smokescreen".



Maya Creation 1
Appendix 2
THE MOST IMPORTANT SYMBOLS OF THE MAYA CREATION MYTH
A set of references to the basic concepts
1. ASTRONOMY IN THE CODICES
[http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/codex.html]
“We found a great number of books and since they contained nothing but superstitions and falsehoods of the devil we burned them, which they took most grievously, and which gave them great pain”
(Friar Diego de Landa, 1566)
Only four Maya glyph books, called codices, survive. They are painted on lime-whitened bark paper, folded accordion-style. The codices were likely produced in the late post-Classical period (1200-1519 AD). Some material in the codices, including astronomical tables, appears to have been copied or adapted from manuscripts of the Classical period (200 - 900 AD). The long count entry date of the Dresden Codex eclipse table, for example, correlates to 755 AD. This may date the original version of the table.
Unlike the Classical inscriptions, which are mainly concerned with events in the lives of kings, the codices are what Bruce Love has called "priest's handbooks." They are filled with information needed to time rituals and make auguries. Astronomical tables are an important part of at least three of the surviving codices. The codices also include pages devoted to new year rituals, and almanacs that follow the sacred round of the 260-day tzolk'in. There is accumulating evidence that astronomical information and cross- references to the astronomical tables are hidden in these as well.
The Dresden Codex includes:
* An eclipse table that predicts times when eclipses may occur. This sophisticated exercise in observation and computation may be the most impressive achievement of Maya astronomy.
* A Venus table that predicts the times of heliacal rise (when Venus appears as morning star) and the other apparitions of the planet. It includes a mechanism for correcting the table for reuse at later dates.
Venus astronomy was particularly important throughout Mesoamerica. According to the Manuscript of Serna, a missionary report from Central Mexico, the natives "adored and made more sacrifices" to Venus than any other "celestial or terrestrial creatures" apart from the sun. The Grolier Codex, a recently discovered but badly damaged Maya codex, is a fragmentary Venus table. It appears to be simpler in structure than the Dresden Codex Venus table, and resembles what are thought to be Venus tables in the central Mexican Borgia Group Codices.
* A Mars table that records the times when Mars goes into retrograde motion. A second Mars table that tracks the planet's motion along the ecliptic has recently been identified.



Maya Creation 2
The third Maya codex that unequivocally contains an astronomical table is the Paris Codex. This incomplete document includes what appears to be a Maya zodiac. Fantastic animals representing constellations along the sun's path about the sky hang from a “sky band”, which represents the ecliptic in Classical inscriptions and the codices.
The Codex illustrates thirteen constellations along the ecliptic (one more than the twelve in the Old World zodiac). The constellations are apparently not illustrated in the order they appear in the heavens. Instead, each illustration is separated from the next by a count of 168 days.
Although most scholars identify these pages in the Codex as a zodiac, some are not convinced. They agree that the Codex likely depicts constellations, but argue that the Maya did not conceive a "zodiac" in the Old World sense.
The Madrid Codex is perhaps the least understood of the surviving glyph books. It may have been produced after the conquest in Tayasal, a Maya kingdom that retained its independence until the end of the 17th C.
No astronomical tables have been identified with certainty in the Madrid, but there is astronomical symbolism. Skybands and what are likely zodiac and eclipse symbols appear in many illustrations. Pages 1218 contain a long tzolk'in almanac with celestial serpents twining through it. (Serpents are often sky symbols. Chan means both "sky" and "snake"). This almanac has long been thought to have to do with agricultural seasons. Harvey and Victoria Bricker have recently suggested that it is an eclipse table.
2. MAYA ASTRONOMICAL GLYPHS AND SYMBOLS
[http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/glyphs.html]
2.1. Venus
In Maya myth, Venus is the companionof the Sun. This no doubt reflects the fact that Venus is always close to the Sun in the sky, rising not long before sunrise as morning star or after sunset as evening star. In the Classical period (250-900 AD), Venus was associated with Hun Ahaw, who guided his twin Yax Balam, the sun, through the Underworld. Hun Ahaw later became Hunaphu in the Hero Twins myth cycle in the post-Conquest Popul Vuh. Translator Dennis Tedlock interprets these myths as an account of the apparitions of Venus from heliacal rise as morning star, through disappearance beneath the night time horizon, to rise again as evening star.
The Venus table in the post-Classical Dresden Codex (c. 1200 AD) begins with heliacal rise of the planet on the date 1 (hun) Ahaw in the sacred almanac known as the tzolk'in. But the post-Classical deity most closely associated with Venus is Kukulkan, the Maya counterpart of the Aztec/Toltec culture hero Quetzelcoatl. He is illustrated in the Dresden Codex Venus table. However, the table actually includes a whole pantheon of Venus deities. Kulkukan is portrayed as only one of four Lords of Venus at heliacal rise. There are also four Lords of Venus as morning star, and Venus Lords for each of the other apparitions of the planet. More about the Dresden Codex Venus table and Venus deities
Mesoamerican deities are moreamorphous than the gods of Greek and Roman myth. All were likely conceived as manifestations of itz or ch'ul, the sacred stuff that animates the world. Each deity appears to have had multipleaspects, which over-lappedwith those of others. The multiple Venus gods are perhaps typical. Another example, also from Venus mythology, is the confusing identity of GI, one of the deities of the Paleneque triad. GI is likely equivalent to Hun Ahaw, but his glyph resembles Chak, the Rain God. This is perhaps not surprising since Chak has other associations with Venus.



Maya Creation 3
2.2. Mars
Mars does not figure prominently in Maya myth. No god can be identified as the "Mars God." However, the Dresden Codex contains a table tracking the motion of Mars. The illustrations in the table show a strange animal hanging from a sky-band. Dubbed the "Mars Beast" by scholars, it is likely a peccary. The beast's name glyph appears in the text of the table as a stylized head with a curved snout.
Mars is also represented, but as a human figure, in the murals at Bonampak.
2.3. The Maya Zodiac
In both inscriptions and glyph books, celestial bodies are often shown suspended from a "sky band." Each element in the band is a glyph with astronomical significance, though all of them have not been deciphered. The sky band represents the ecliptic, the path of the sun, moon, and planets through the heavens against the background of stars.
In European astronomy, star groups along the ecliptic mark the 12 constellations of the Zodiac. The Paris Codex includes a Maya zodiac, divided into 13 constellations. The constellations are represented by fantastic beasts suspended from sky bands. Unfortunately, the manuscript is damaged, so identification of the constellations is difficult.
Fig. 1. Turtle (ak) and "3 stones" (Ox Tun) hang from sun signs and sky band (from Madrid
Codex). The 3 stones and turtle represent bright stars in Orion. The "3 stones of Creation" are an important symbol in Maya creation myths.
Fig. 2. The Ecliptic is also represented by the two-headed “Cosmic Monster”. The front head may have deer ears or hooves, and is almost always marked with the Venusglyph. The rear head usually has a fleshless jaw, and is almost always marked with a k'in (Sun) sign. The monster's body is either a sky band or reptile. As a twoheaded snake, it appears as the “serpent bar”, an emblem of royal authority carried by rulers.
Serpent symbols: In Maya languages, chan (sky) and kan (serpent) are homonyms. Thus snakes or snake-bodied creatures are often sky symbols.
Fig. 3. Serpent bar representing the ecliptic forms the cross-piece of the Palenque "cross" or World Tree
2.4. The Milky Way
The World Tree is the most pervasive Maya symbol of the creation and ordering of the world. It is the axis of the Earth-Sky. Through the centre of the “cross” runs a serpent bar, representing the ecliptic. (Its roots lie in the Underworld, Xibalba, and its top reaches into the heavens. In the postConquest Books of Chilam Balam, it is named Yax Imix Che, (first or green ceiba tree), "raised in the middle of the world." It is named in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque as the WakahChan, the "raised up sky." L. Schele discovered that the World Tree is a literal depiction of the heavens as well as an abstract symbol. Her investigations, vividly recounted in Maya Cosmos, led her to the conclusion that the Milky Way is the World Tree ... Fig. 4. Palenque "cross" [http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html ]. Larger image



Maya Creation 4
The World Tree symbolizes the Milky Way. On the night of August 13, the date of creation, the Milky Way stands erect at dawn, running through the zenith from north to south. It becomes the axis of the heavens, the raised up sky. See "Raising the Sky: The Maya Creation Myth and the Milky Way"
Wakah Chan: The glyph Linda Schele identified as the name of the World Tree/Milky Way in the inscription in the Palenque Temple of the Cross is Wakah Chan, "raised up sky." The main element is the most commonly encountered glyph for chan, "sky." The prefix is the number six, which is pronounced wak in Mayan languages. The affix above the main glyph is ah, a verbal affix commonly encountered in the Maya script.
2.5. The 4- and 8-pointed Crosses in the World Trees
World Quarters: Colours and Directions
[http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/glyphs.html]
The Maya World Tree rose in the centre of the Earth-Sky. About this centre, the cosmos was divided into four quarters, each oriented to one of the cardinal points, and each associated with its own sacred tree and
colour. Each quarter is divided in turn, creating eight partitions of the world. The trees at the cardinal points support the sky, a role also assigned in some accounts to deities known as Bakabs, Pawahtuns, or Chaks.
East is the direction of sunrise, associated with red, the colour of dawn. West is the direction of sunset; its colour is black. North is white. The colour of the south is yellow. Green is the colour of the centre, of the green ceiba tree, representing the great World Tree itself, raised in the centre of the cosmos.
Codex Fejérváry-Mayer
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Fejervary-Mayer]
The Codex Fejérváry-Mayer is an Aztec Codex of central Mexico. It is one of the rare pre-Hispanic manuscripts that have survived the Spanish conquest of Mexico. As a typical calendar codex tonalamatl dealing with the sacred Aztec calendar -- the tonalpohualli -- it is grouped in the Codex Borgia group. Its elaboration is typically pre-Columbian: it is made on deerskin parchment folded accordion-style into 23 pages. It measures 16.2 centimetres by 17.2 centimetres and is 3.85 metres long. The earliest history of the codex is unknown. It is named after Gabriel Fejérváry (1780–1851), a Hungarian collector, and Joseph Mayer (1803–1886), an English antiquarian who bought the codex from Fejérváry. In 2004 Maarten Jansen and Gabina Aurora Pérez Jiménez proposed that it be given the indigenous name Codex Tezcatlipoca, from the Nahuatl name of the god Tezcatlipoca, although it is not certain that its creators were Nahuas. It is currently kept in the Merseyside Museum in Liverpool, England

2.6. Maya and Aztec World Ages
Maya calendar
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Calendar]
In Maya Long count system a.b.c.d.e.f the weights of the orders (a to f ) are different:
Table of Long Count units
Days Long Count periods Long Count Solar years Tuns
1 = 1 K'in
20 = 20 K'in = 1 Winal
360 = 18 Winal = 1 Tun ~ 1 1
7 200 = 20 Tun = 1 K'atun ~ 20 20
144 000 = 20 K'atun = 1 B'ak'tun ~ 395 400
This means that the afterthedate 12.19.19.17.19 follows1.0.0.0.0.0, because the next date for 0.0.0.0.19 is 0.0.0.1.0 (20 Kins make 1 Winal), the next date for 0.0.0.17.19 is 0.0.1.0.0 (18 Winals a Tun), the next date for 0.0.19.17.19 is 0.1.0.0.0 (20 Tuns a Katun), the next date for 0.19.19.17.19 is 1.0.0.0.0 (20 Katuns a Baktun), and therefore the next date for 12.19.19.17.19 is 1.0.0.0.0.0 (13 Baktuns a Long Count period).
The Long Count date 0.0.0.0.0 corresponds to Proleptic Gregorian Calendar Date August 11, 3114 BCE, whereas the next Long Count date 0.0.0.0.0 (the end of the 13th b'ak'tun) comes to December 21, 2012 CE
(or 1.0.0.0.0.0 – in the extended scale of notation).
The end of the 13th b'ak'tun is conjectured to have been of great significance to the Maya, but does not necessarily mark the end of the world according to their beliefs, but a new beginning or time of re-birth. According to the Popol Vuh, a book compiling details of creation accounts known to the Quiché Maya of the colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fifth world. The Popol Vuh describes the first four creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fifth world where men were placed. The Maya believed that the fifth world wouldendincatastropheand the sixth and final world would be created that would signal the end of mankind. However, some authors refer to Hopi and Maya mythology which define the current world as the fourth. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_World_(Native_American_mythology]
The last creation ended on a long count of 12.19.19.17.19. Another 12.19.19.17.19 will occur on December 20, 2012, and it has been discussed in many New Age articles and books that this will be the end of this creation, the next pole shift or something else entirely. However, the Maya abbreviated their long counts to just the last five vigesimal places. There was an infinite number of larger unitsthatwereusuallynot shown. Therefore, on December 21, 2012 we will have not the end of the first 13-Baktun cycle, but the end of the 5th cycle of this type, viz. the date 5.0.0.0.0.0.
The Maya Creation Myth and the Milky Way [http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html]
The creation myths of most Mesoamerican peoples included the idea of successive “ages” or “creations”. According to the Aztec Legend of the Five Suns in the Codex Chimalpopoca , the world will pass through
five “suns” ruled by different solar deities. The 4th sun ended when “it rained so hard the sky fell down”. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca changed themselves into trees. As the trees grew, “the sky was pushed up”. Then these gods travelled the "White Road," the Milky Way, to meet in the heavens.



Maya Creation 6
In the centre of the famous Aztec sun stone is Tonatiuh, Lord of the fifth
sun. The pictographs about his face represent the four previous suns, and the
way each ended: By wild animals, wind, fire, and flood. The glyph above
the face, 4 Olin, "earth quake", names the current sun, which will end by earth quake. According to some scholars, each "sun" lasts 100 calendar rounds (5196 years), nearly equivalent to a great cycle (13 baktuns = 5125 years) of the Maya long count. Due to precession of the equinoxes, the equinox points slowly slip along the ecliptic, taking about 26,000 years to complete circuit. Five suns will last nearly Fig. 6. Aztec Sun Stone 26,000 years. This may be evidence of knowledge of precession.
3. THE PLACES OF SYSTEMATIC MANIFESTATIONS OF MAYA COSMOGONY
3.1. The World Trees (Crosses) at Palenque
3.1.1. The World Tree at Palenque
[http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/palenquecross.html]
Temples of the Cross Group consists of three structures, the Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Foliated Cross, and Temple of the Sun.
The World Tree is depicted as a symbol of the Milky Way, the Wakah Chan ("Raised-up Sky") in the Temple of the Cross. On the dates assigned to centering of the world at Creation of the present era, the Milky Way stands erect in the sky at dawn.
In the Temple of the Foliated Cross, the World Tree is the Na Te K'an ("First Precious Tree"), a symbol of the sky-raising Maize God Hun-Nal-Ye.
The Temple of Sun is decorated with a “Sun Shield” that may symbolize the birth of the sun.

3.2. The Stelae at Izapa
3.2.1. Izapa [www.utexas.edu/ftp/cofa/a_ah/dir/precol/izapa.htm]
The site of Izapa is located along the Pacific coastal piedmont of Chiapas in a location that sat at the juncture between Mixe-Zoquean-speaking peoples to the West and Mayan-speaking peoples to the East. Although there is evidence of occupation at the site during the Early Formative, the site reached its height during the Late Formative period (300 BC - AD 250). The site is most famous for the many stelae that were erected in combination with carved and plain altars. These were placed within large quadrangular plazas that were bounded by pyramidal mounds.
Themes from several of the stelae recall those from Middle Formative monuments. For example, Izapa Stela 5 the largest and most complex stela at the site, depicts an enormous World Tree that bisects the composition. The tree stretches from a watery basal layer at the bottom to a celestial band at the top. A series of mythic and quasi-historical scenes appear on either side of the tree, while the bodies of two zoomorphic beasts frame the scene on either side.
The quadrangular plaza of Group B was the focus of ritual activity by 300 BC. While the Group B plaza contains many stela-altar combinations, it is most famous for its triadic arrangement of pillars. Each of the three pillars, measuring about 130 cm tall, holds a stone sphere that is about 70 cm in diameter.
The triadic arrangement of the pillars was the earthly equivalent of the Three Hearthstones of Creation, which were also reflected in the night sky in the three stars in the belt of the constellation Orion.



Maya Creation 8
3.2.2. Izapan Cosmos [http://edj.net/mc2012/ballcourt-schematic-and-description.html]
3.2.2.1. The basic concept of his work [J.M. Jenkins A Brief Summary of the Monuments in the Izapan Ballcourt http://alignment2012.com] the author specifies as follows:
“The monuments in the Izapan ballcourt encode a knowledge of the solstice-galaxy alignment of era2012, and that alignment was the intended target anchor for the end of the 13-baktun cycle and thus the placement of the Long Count in real time.
I am very interested in having a dialogue with progressive Mayan scholars on my reconstruction of Izapan cosmology, as this synthesis of the accepted data is straightforward. The assemblage of different lines of evidence, all converging on the same conclusion, seems to me to eliminate coincidence as a viable alternate explanation for the integrative continuity of these symbol complexes. Please share your thoughts”.
Note. Ballcourts were a focal point of ceremonial centers, from the Maya city-state of Copan, Honduras, to the Hohokam site of Snaketown, in Phoenix, Arizona [www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/maya/mayaprint.html].
3.2.2.2. The Ancient Symbols in the Stelae of Izapa
Stela 25
Izapa’s heyday occurred between 300 BC and AD 50. Its monuments contain recognizable scenes from Maya Creation mythology— adventures of the Hero Twins, their father, and their triumph over Seven Macaw. These themes were later incorporated into the Quiché Popol Vuh. I have already suggested that Stela 25 from Izapa embodies a dialectic between two parts of the sky – the Big Dipper polar region and the “head” of the Milky Way monster near Sagittarius:
a) The Big Dipper vs. The Milky Way b) Fragment (Crocodile)
Fig. 9. Stela 25
Stela 25 (Fig. 8.a) also contains a recognizable Popol Vuh episode, in which Hunahpu’s arm is torn off by Seven Macaw. Since Seven Macaw is identified with the Big Dipper of the polar region, I suggested (1996, 1998) that the “fall” of Seven Macaw involved the demise of an old cosmological system centered upon the polar region. The shamanistic concern with knowing where the center of the sky is located is central to understanding this “cosmological shift.” The shift, after Seven Macaw was done away with, was to an opposite orientation, as revealed in the diagram above. The dialectic sets the head of the alligator ((Fig. 8.b – Credit to: http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/mainmaya.html) in opposition to Seven Macaw. This “alligator-head” is the location of another cosmological “center of the sky” – it is the location of the center of our Milky Way galaxy. (Note: I am omitting arguments and citations that can be found exhaustively documented in my book Maya Cosmogenesis 2012). Generally, this monument—as well as many others from Izapa; e.g., Stela 11— indicate an interest in the Milky Way, the dark-rift in the Milky Way (the mouth is the dark-rift), and the Big Dipper.



Maya Creation 9
Stela 67 (Fig. 5 of the article) Similar to Stelae 11 and 22 (Fig. 7.a, 7.b of the article). Here, a solar lord sits in the middle of a cosmic canoe. Incised bones from Tikal reveal that celestial canoes represented the Milky Way. His outstetched arms indicate a “period ending” event. He is probably the Hero Twins’ father, One Hunahpu, who is resurrected at the end of the Age, after they defeat Seven Macaw and the Lords of the Underworld. The sun located in the middle of the Milky Way canoe is compelling. Combined with the emphasis on the solstice sun via the ballcourt’s orientation, and other arguments omitted here, this solar deity (One Hunahpu) is probably the December solstice sun lord. The seating declivity of canoes could easily be seen to be analogous to the Great Cleft of the Milky Way, which shares this astronomical identification with so many other mythological adumbrations. In such a scenario it becomes difficult to avoid deducing that the entire complex of carvings in the Izapan ballcourt express the alignment of the solstice sun lord with the Great Cleft in the Milky Way. Such a rare alignment occurs via precession, and it happens in the era of the 13baktun cycle’s ending date, December 21, 2012.
Stela 22 (Fig. 7.b of the article) It has an unusual history. It was found in a discarded location in Group F, in the 1950s. A local person acquired it and recarved the surfaces, to imaginatively deepen the design. The actual lines of the authentic design were thereby obscured and mutilated. Today it stands at the entrance to the Group F ballcourt, an abstract rendition of the original artifact.
The upper portion shows the lower register of a sky band, so we know that we have reached the upper limit of the carving, and thus most of the design is preserved. Several significant things can be said. First, the image is so closely similar to Stela 67, that we should suspect that Stela 67 had iconographic motifs in the same locations of its lost sections. Second, the restored Stela 22 contains three tiers or levels of action. ... With this in mind, let's highlight the three levels of Stela 22.
Level 1 contains two fish swimming in water, two masks on the far left and right sides, and a solar deity in a canoe in the middle.
This much closely parallels what we also see on Stela 67. Kappelman points out that the masks here on Stela 22 are death heads (note the white bone on cheek). The distinction then, between Stela 22 and Stela 67, is that one relates to the death or descent of the Maize God (who I emphasize is a solar deity, the December solstice sun and One Hunahpu in the Creation Myth) and the other relates to the birth or rebirth of the Maize God / December solstice sun.
The second tier [contains] what appears to be a serpent headed rope that suspends the canoe over the waters. A parallel serpent rope is on the right. ... In fact, with the bird deitiy at the third level, three levels of enthronement are probably suggested here, reinforcing my thesis that Izapan cosmography is basically tripartite in nature, with reference to three cosmic centers and their three enthroned deities. Level 3 of Stela 22 shows the sky dragon, or the sonamed Principal Bird Deity that is most likely referential to Seven Macaw in the Creation Myth (the Big Dipper in the circumpolar northern sky).
3.2.2.3. The Egyptian Analogue of Izapan Stelae.
We find a similar symbology with the Egyptians. In the “Orion Mystery” by Gilbert and Bauval we find a picture of Osiris standing erect in a barque on the Milky Way river, stretching ONE hand horizontally with the ankh in his hand (Fig. 6 of the article). The ankh is held vertical and is pointing up towards the Silver Gate (Gateway of Men) according to Gilbert and Bauval. Now, Gilbert has found that the Egyptian word for star, s’ba, also means “door”, so Osiris is holding a Star-Gate. In some depictions, Osiris is holding an ankh towards the gate, so this must be the key which unlocks the star-gate. The Silver Gate or Gateway of Men is the crossing of ecliptic and the Milky Way in between Gemini and Taurus

Appendix 3
THE ONCE UNIVERSAL COSMOGONY AND ITS DESCRIPTION
IN THE SECRET DOCTRINE
A set of references to the basic concepts
References are given to “The Secret Doctrine” by H.P. Blavatsky (e.g. [SD 1, 341] – Vol. 1, page 341): Spiritual Literature in Different Languages (including Russian and English)
1. Preface
The fragments of the systems that have now reached us are rejected as absurd fables. Nevertheless, occult Science – having survived even the great Flood that submersed the antediluvian giants and with them their very memory, save in the Secret Doctrine, the Bible and other Scriptures – still holds the Key to all the world problems. Let us apply that Key to the rare fragments of long-forgotten cosmogonies and try by their scattered parts to re-establish the once Universal Cosmogony of the Secret Doctrine. The Key fits them all. No one can study ancient philosophies seriously without perceiving that the striking similitude of conception between all – in their exoteric form very often, in their hidden spirit invariably – is the result of no mere coincidence, but of a concurrent design: and that there was, during the youth of mankind, one languages, one knowledge, one universal religion, when there were no churches, no creeds or sects, but when every man was a priest unto himself. And, if it is shown that already in those ages which are shut out from our sight by the exuberant growth of tradition, human religious thought developed in uniform sympathy in every portion of the globe; then, it becomes evident that, born under whatever latitude, in the cold North or the burning South, in the East or West, that thought was inspired by the same revelations, and man was nurtured under the protecting shadow of the same TREE OF KNOWLEDGE [SD 1, 341].
2. Logos vs. Logoi or Builders
2.1. The “Supreme ALL”
... Such active "Creators" are known to exist and are believed in, because perceived and sensed by the inner man in the Occultist. Thus the latter says that an ABSOLUTE Deity, having to be unconditioned and unrelated, cannot be thought of at the same time as an active, creating, one living god, without immediate degradation of the ideal.* A Deity that manifests in Space and Time -- these two being simply the forms of THAT which is the Absolute ALL -- can be but a fractional part of the whole. And since that "all" cannot be divided in its absoluteness, therefore that sensed creator (we say Creators) can be at best but the mere aspect thereof [SD 2, 158].
To use the same metaphor – inadequate to express the full idea, yet well adapted to the case in hand these creators are like the numerous rays of the solar orb, which remains unconscious of, and unconcerned in, the work; while its mediating agents, the rays, become the instrumental media every spring – the Manvantaric dawn of the Earth – in fructifying and awakening the dormant vitality inherent in Nature and its differentiated matter [SD 2, 159].
... Therefore, when the Pantheists echo the Upanishads, which state, as in the Secret Doctrine, that "this" cannot create, they do not deny a Creator, or rather a collective aggregate of creators, but only refuse, very logically, to attribute “creation” and especially formation, something finite to an Infinite Principle. With them, Parabrahmam is a passive because an Absolute Cause, the unconditioned Mukta. It is only limited Omniscience and Omnipotence that are refused to the latter,



Old World Symbolism 2 because these are still attributes (as reflected in man's perceptions); and because Parabrahm, being the “Supreme ALL”, the ever invisible spirit and Soul of Nature, changeless and eternal, can have no attributes; absoluteness very naturally precluding any idea of the finite or conditioned from being connected with it. And if the Vedantin postulates attributes as belonging simply to its emanation, calling it “Iswara plus Maya”, and Avidya (Agnosticism and Nescience rather than ignorance), it is difficult to find any Atheism in this conception. Since there can be neither two INFINITES nor two ABSOLUTES in a Universe supposed to be Boundless, this Self-Existence can hardly be conceived of as creating personally. In the sense and perceptions of finite "Beings," THAT is Non-“being”, in the sense that it is the one BE-NESS; for, in this ALL lies concealed its coeternal and coeval emanation or inherent radiation, which, upon becoming periodically Brahma (the male-female Potency) becomes or expands itself into the manifested Universe. Narayana moving on the (abstract) waters of Space, is transformed into the Waters of concrete substance moved by him, who now becomes the manifested WORD or Logos. [SD 1, 7]
Thus there is but one Absolute Upadhi (basis) in the spiritual sense, from, on, and in which, are built for Manvantaric purposes the countless basic centres on which proceed the Universal, cyclic, and individual Evolutions during the active period [SD 2, 34].
“The informing Intelligences, which animate these various centres of Being, are referred to indiscriminately by men beyond the Great Range (“Beyond” the Great Range, means, in our case, India, as being the Trans-Himalayan region for the Cis-Himalayan region) as the Manus, the Rishis, the Pitris**, the Prajapati, and so on; and as Dhyani Buddhas, the Chohans, Melhas (fire-gods), Bodhisattvas,*** and others, on this side. The truly ignorant call them gods; the learned profane, the one God; and the wise, the Initiates, honour in them only the Manvantaric manifestations of THAT which neither our Creators (the Dhyan Chohans) nor their creatures can ever discuss or know anything about. The ABSOLUTE is not to be defined, and no mortal or immortal has ever seen or comprehended it during the periods of Existence. The mutable cannot know the Immutable, nor can that which lives perceive Absolute Life.”
Therefore, man cannot know higher beings than his own “progenitors”. “Nor shall he worship them”, but he ought to learn how he came into the world [SD 2, 34].
... in Occult metaphysics there are, properly speaking, two "ONES" – the One on the unreachable plane of Absoluteness and Infinity, on which no speculation is possible, and the Second "One" on the plane of Emanations. The former can neither emanate nor be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and immutable. The Second, being, so to speak, the reflection of the first One (for it is the Logos, or Eswara, in the Universe of Illusion), can do all this.** It emanates from itself – as the upper Sephirothal Triad emanates the lower seven Sephiroth – the seven Rays or Dhyan Chohans; in other words, the Homogeneous becomes the Heterogeneous, the "Protyle" differentiates into the Elements [SD 1, 129].
But just as the opposite poles of subject and object, spirit and matter, are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized, so, in the manifested Universe, there is "that" which links spirit to matter, subject to object.
This something, at present unknown to Western speculation, is called by the occultists Fohat. It is the "bridge" by which the "Ideas" existing in the "Divine Thought" are impressed on Cosmic substance as the "laws of Nature." Fohat is thus the dynamic energy of Cosmic Ideation; or, regarded from the other side, it is the intelligent medium, the guiding power of all manifestation, the "Thought Divine" transmitted and made manifest through the Dhyan Chohans,* the Architects of the visible World. Thus from Spirit, or Cosmic Ideation, comes our consciousness; from Cosmic Substance the several vehicles in which that consciousness is individualised and attains to self – or reflective consciousness; while Fohat, in its various manifestations, is the mysterious link between Mind and Matter, the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.



Old World Symbolism 3 The following summary will afford a clearer idea to the reader. (1.) The ABSOLUTE; the Parabrahm of the Vedantins or the one Reality, SAT, which is, as Hegel says, both Absolute Being and Non-Being. (2.) The first manifestation, the impersonal, and, in philosophy, unmanifested Logos, the precursor of the "manifested." This is the "First Cause," the "Unconscious" of European Pantheists.
(3.) Spirit-matter, LIFE; the "Spirit of the Universe," the Purusha and Prakriti, or the second Logos. (4.) Cosmic Ideation, MAHAT or Intelligence, the Universal World-Soul; the Cosmic Noumenon of Matter, the basis of the intelligent operations in and of Nature, also called MAHA-BUDDHI. The ONE REALITY; its dual aspects in the conditioned Universe [SD 1, 16].
2.2. Logos
Explaining some of the "heresies" of his day, Justin Martyr shows the identity of all the world religions at their starting points. The first beginning opens invariably with the unknown and PASSIVE deity, from which emanates a certain active power or virtue, the Mystery that is sometimes called WISDOM, sometimes the SON, very often God, Angel, Lord, and LOGOS. The latter is sometimes applied to the very first emanation, but in several systems it proceeds from the first androgyne or double ray produced at the beginning by the unseen. Philo depicts this wisdom as male and female [SD 2, 489].
“The universe”, says every Philosophy and Cosmogony, “hath a Ruler (Rulers collectively) set over it, which is called the WORD (Logos); the fabricating Spirit is its Queen: which two are the First Power after the ONE” [SD 2, 36].
The “Heavenly Man” (Tetragrammaton) who is the Protogonos, Tikkoun, the firstborn from the passive deity and the first manifestation of that deity's shadow, is the universal form and idea, which engenders the manifested Logos, Adam Kadmon, or the four-lettered symbol, in the Kabala, of the Universe itself, also called the second Logos. [SD 2, 25]
At the commencement of a great Manvantara, Parabrahm manifests as Mulaprakriti and then as the Logos. This Logos is equivalent to the "Unconscious Universal Mind," etc., of Western Pantheists. It constitutes the Basis of the SUBJECT-side of manifested Being, and is the source of all manifestations of individual consciousness. Mulaprakriti or Primordial Cosmic Substance, is the foundation of the OBJECT-side of things – the basis of all objective evolution and Cosmogenesis. Force, then, does not emerge with Primordial Substance from Parabrahmic Latency. It is the transformation into energy of the supra-conscious thought of the Logos, infused, so to speak, into the objectivation of the latter out of potential latency in the One Reality. Hence spring the wondrous laws of matter [SD 2, 24].
... This relates to the Logos of every Cosmogony. The unknown Light – with which he is said to be coeternal and coeval – is reflected in the "First-Born," the Protogonos; and the Demiurgos or the Universal Mind directs his Divine Thought into the Chaos that under the fashioning of minor gods will be divided into the seven oceans – Sapta samudras. It is Purusha, Ahura Mazda, Osiris, etc., and finally the gnostic Christos, who is in the Kabala, Hokhmah or Wisdom the “Word” [SD 2, 703].
It is a well-known fact – to learned Symbologists at all events – that in every great religion of antiquity, it is the Logos Demiurge (the second logos), or the first emanation from the mind (Mahat), who is made to strike, so to say, the key-note of that which may be called the correlation of individuality and personality in the subsequent scheme of evolution. The Logos it is, who is shown in the mystic symbolism of cosmogony, theogony, and anthropogony, playing two parts in the drama of Creation and Being, i.e., that of the purely human personality and the divine impersonality of the so-called Avatars, or divine incarnations, and of the universal Spirit, called Christos by the Gnostics, and the Farvarshi (or Ferouer) of Ahura Mazda in the Mazdean philosophy. On the lower rungs of theogony the celestial Beings of lower Hierarchies had each a Farvarshi, or a celestial "Double." It is the same, only a still more mystic, reassertion of the Kabalistic axiom, “Deus est Demon inversus”; the word “demon”, however, as in the case of Socrates, and in the spirit of the meaning given to it by the whole of



Old World Symbolism 4 antiquity, standing for the guardian Spirit, an “Angel”, not a devil of Satanic descent, as theology will have it [SD 2, 478].
The reader must bear in mind that there is a great difference between the LOGOS and the Demiurgos, for one is Spirit and the other is Soul; ... Moreover, Man was regarded in several systems as the third Logos. The esoteric meaning of the word Logos (speech or word, Verbum) is the rendering in objective expression, as in a photograph, of the concealed thought. The Logos is the mirror reflecting DIVINE MIND, and the Universe is the mirror of the Logos, though the latter is the esse of that Universe. As the Logos reflects all in the Universe of Pleroma, so man reflects in himself all that he sees and finds in his Universe, the Earth. It is the three Heads of the Kabala: "Unum intra alterum, et alterum super alterum" (Zohar, Idra Suta, sec. VII). "Every Universe (world or planet) has its own Logos," says the doctrine. The Sun was always called by the Egyptians "the eye of Osiris," and was himself the Logos, the first-begotten, or light made manifest to the world, "which is the Mind and divine intellect of the Concealed." It is only by the sevenfold Ray of this light that we can become cognizant of the Logos through the Demiurge, regarding the latter as the creator of our planet and everything pertaining to it, and the formeras theguidingForceof that "Creator" – good and bad at the same time, the origin of good and the origin of evil. This "Creator" is neither good nor bad per se, but its differentiated aspects in nature make it assume one or the other character. With the invisible and the unknown Universes disseminated through space, none of the sun-gods had anything to do. The idea is expressed very clearly in the "Books of Hermes," and in every ancient folk lore. It is symbolised generally by the Dragon and the Serpent the Dragon of Good and the Serpent of Evil ... [SD 2, 25].
The Zohar gives it very suggestively. When the “Holy One” (the Logos) desired to create man, he called the highest host of Angels [SD 2, 491].
In the ancient Cosmogonies, the visible and the invisible worlds are the double links of one and the same chain. As the invisible Logos, with its sevenhierarchies (represented or personified each by its chief angel or rector), form one POWER, the inner and the invisible; so, in the world of Forms, the Sun and the seven chief Planets constitute the visible and active potency; the latter "Hierarchy" being, so to speak, the visible and objective Logos of the invisible and (except in the lowest grades) eversubjective angels [SD 2, 23].
... In order to make my meaning clear I may point out here that the Logos has seven forms. In other words, there are seven kinds of Logoi in the Cosmos. Each of these has become the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the ancient Wisdom-religion [SD 2, 636]. (See also Fohat and the divine Builders [SD 2, 590]).
2.3. Architect
Whatever may be the destiny of these actual writings in a remote future, we hope to have proven so far the following facts: (1) The Secret Doctrine teaches no Atheism, except in the Hindu sense of the word nastika, or the rejection of idols, including every anthropomorphic god. In this sense every Occultist is a Nastika. (2) It admits a Logos or a collective "Creator" of the Universe; a Demiurgos -- in the sense implied when one speaks of an "Architect" as the "Creator" of an edifice, whereas that Architect has never touched one stone of it, but, while furnishing the plan, left all the manual labour to the masons; in our case the plan was furnished by the Ideation of the Universe, and the constructive labour was left to the Hosts of intelligent Powers and Forces. But that Demiurgos is no personal deity, - i.e., an imperfect extra-cosmic god, - but only the aggregate of the Dhyan-Chohans and the other forces [SD 1, 279].
In every Cosmogony, behind and higher than the creative deity, there is a superior deity, a planner, an Architect, of whom the Creator is but the executive agent. And still higher, over and around, within and without, there is the UNKNOWABLE and the unknown, the Source and Cause of all these Emanations [SD 1, 43].



Old World Symbolism 5 Light is the great Protean magician, and under the divine will of the architect, or rather the architects, the "Builders" (called One collectively), its multifarious, omnipotent waves gave birth to every form as well as to every living being. ... Within its beams lie the beginnings of all physical and chemical action, and of all cosmic and spiritual phenomena; it vitalizes and disorganizes; it gives life and produces death, and from its primordial point gradually emerged into existence the myriads of worlds, visible and invisible celestial bodies [SD 1, 579].
The previous Globes disintegrate and reappear transformed and perfected for a new phase of life. In the Kabala, worlds are compared to sparks which fly from under the hammer of the great Architect LAW, the law which rules all the smaller Creators. [SD 1, 199]. Kabalistically speaking, the "Architect" is the generic name for the Sephiroth, the Builders of the Universe, as the "Universal Mind" represents the collectivity of the Dhyan Chohanic Minds [SD 1, 579].
SYMBOL : This first, or rather ONE, principle was called "the circle of Heaven," symbolized by the hierogram of a point within a circle or equilateral triangle, the point being the LOGOS. Thus, in the Rig Veda, wherein Brahma is not even named, Cosmogony is preluded with the Hiranyagharha, "the Golden Egg," and Prajapati (Brahma later on), from whom emanate all the hierarchies of "Creators." The Monad, or point, is the original and is the unit from which follows the entire numeral system. This Point is the First Cause, but THAT from which it emanates, or of which, rather, it is the expression, the Logos, is passed over in silence. In its turn, the universal symbol, the point within the circle, was not yet the Architect, but the cause of that Architect; and the latter stood to it in precisely the same relation as the point itself stood to the circumference of the Circle, which cannot be defined, according to Hermes Trismegistus [SD 1, 426].
NAME: In the cosmogonies of all the nations it is the "Architects" synthesized by Demiurgos (in the Bible the "Elohim"), who fashion Kosmos out of Chaos, and who are the collective Theos, "malefemale," Spirit and matter. "By a series (yom) of foundations (hasoth) the Alhim caused earth and heaven to be" (Gen. ii., 4). In the Bible it is first Alhim, then Jahva-Alhim, and finally Jehovah --after the separation of the sexes in chapter iv. of Genesis. It is noticeable that nowhere, except in the later, the last Cosmogonies of our Fifth race, is the ineffable and unutterable NAME*** – the symbol of the Unknown Deity, which was used only in the MYSTERIES – used in connection with the "Creation" of the Universe. It is the "Movers," the "Runners," the theoi (from [[theein]], "to run"), who do the work of formation, the "Messengers" of the manvantaric law, who have now become in Christianity the "messengers" (malachim); and it seems the same in Hinduism or early Brahmanism. For it is not Brahma who creates in the Rig Veda, but the Prajapati, the "Lords of Being," who are the Rishis; the word Rishi (according to Professor Mahadeo Kunte) being connected with the word to move, to lead on, applied to them in their terrestrial character, when, as Patriarchs, they lead their hosts on the Seven Rivers. *** It is "unutterable" for the simple reason that it is non-existent. It never was a name, nor any word at all, but an Idea that could not be expressed. A substitute was created for it in the century preceding our era [SD 1, 346].
... the creative Logoi have their understanding opened, and they see in the ideal world (hitherto concealed in the divine thought) the archetypal forms of all, and proceed to copy and build or fashion upon these models forms evanescent and transcendent. At this stage of action, the Demiurge** is not yet the Architect. Born in the twilight of action, he has yet to first perceive the plan, to realise the ideal forms which lie buried in the bosom of Eternal Ideation, as the future lotus-leaves, the immaculate petals, are concealed within the seed of that plant [SD 1, 380].
In the earliest Hindu exoteric cosmogonies, it is not even the Demiurge who creates. For it is said in one of the Puranas that: "The great Architect of the World gives the first impulse to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in turn over each planet and body." It is this action "that causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun." After which action, "it is the Brahmandica, the Solar and Lunar Pitris (the Dhyani-Chohans)" who take charge of their respective spheres (earths and planets), to the end of the Kalpa." The Creators are the Rishis; most of whom are credited with the authorship of



Old World Symbolism 6 the mantras or Hymns of the Rig Veda. They are sometimes seven, sometimes ten, when they become prajapati, the "Lord of Beings"; then they rebecome the seven and the fourteen Manus, as the representatives of the seven and fourteen cycles of Existence ("Days of Brahma"); thus answering to the seven AEons, when at the end of the first stage of Evolution they are transformed into the seven stellar Rishis, the Saptarishis; while their human doubles appear as heroes, Kings and Sages on this earth [SD 1, 442].
2.4. Angelic Hierarchy (Creator, Builders)
The Buddhists maintained that there is no Creator, but an infinitude of creative powers, which collectively form the one eternal substance, the essence of which is inscrutable -- hence not a subject for speculation for any true philosopher [SD 1, 4].
The Stanza [V] proceeds with a minute classification of the Orders of Angelic Hierarchy. From the group of Four and Seven emanates the "mind-born" group of Ten, of Twelve, of Twenty-one, etc., all these divided again into sub-groups of septenaries, novenaries, duodecimals, and so on, until the mind is lost in this endless enumeration of celestial hosts and Beings, each having its distinct task in the ruling of the visible Kosmos during its existence [SD 1, 129].
The Secret Doctrine, in the Stanzas given here, occupies itself chiefly, if not entirely, with our Solar System, and especially with our planetary chain. The "Seven Sons," therefore, are the creators of the latter [SD 1, 60].
Stanza III describes the Re-awakening of the Universe to life after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the "Monads" from their state of absorption within the ONE; the earliest and highest stage in the formation of "Worlds," the term Monad being one which may apply equally to the vastest Solar System or the tiniest atom. Stanza IV shows the differentiation of the "Germ" of the Universe into the septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, who are the active manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are the framers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested Universe, in the only sense in which the name "Creator" is intelligible; they inform and guide it; they are the intelligent Beings who adjust and control evolution, embodying in themselves those manifestations of the ONE LAW, which we know as "The Laws of Nature." Generically, they are known as the Dhyan Chohans, though each of the various groups has its own designation in the Secret Doctrine. This stage of evolution is spoken of in Hindu mythology as the "Creation" of the Gods [SD 1, 22].
Round, or life-cycle on this planet, must occupy the same place in the same order – save details based on local conditions and time – as in the preceding Round. Again, it must be explained and remembered that, as the work of each Round is said to be apportioned to a different group of so-called "Creators" or "Architects," so is that of every globe; i.e., it is under the supervision and guidance of special "Builders" and "Watchers" – the various Dhyan-Chohans [SD 1, 233].
The "Builders," the "Sons of Manvantaric Dawn," are the real creators of the Universe; and in this doctrine, which deals only with our Planetary System, they, as the architects of the latter, are also called the "Watchers" of the Seven Spheres, which exoterically are the Seven planets, and esoterically the seven earths or spheres (planets) of our chain also [SD 1, 53].
There are three chief groups of Builders and as many of the Planetary Spirits and the Lipika, each group being again divided into Seven sub-groups. It is impossible, even in such a large work as this, to enter into a minute examination of even the three principal groups, as it would demand an extra volume. The "Builders" are the representatives of the first "Mind-Born" Entities, therefore of the primeval RishiPrajapati: also of the Seven great Gods of Egypt, of which Osiris is the chief: of the Seven Amshaspends of the Zoroastrians, with Ormazd at their head: or the "Seven Spirits of the Face": the Seven Sephiroth separated from the first Triad, etc. ... They build or rather rebuild every "System" after the "Night." The



Old World Symbolism 7 Second group of the Builders is the Architect of our planetary chain exclusively; and the third, the progenitor of our Humanity - the Macrocosmic prototype of the microcosm [SD 1, 128].
3. Water
These are the Spirit and Nature, which two form our illusory universe. The two inseparables remain in the Universe of Ideas so long as it lasts, and then merge back into Parabrahm, the One ever changeless. "The Spirit, whose essence is eternal, one and self-existent," emanates a pure ethereal LIGHT – a dual light not perceptible to the elementary senses – in the Puranas, in the Bible, in the Sepher Jezirah, ... in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, in the esotericism of Lao-tse, everywhere [SD 2, 37].
But there are two distinct aspects in universal Esotericism, Eastern and Western, in all those personations of the female Power in nature, or nature – the noumenal and the phenomenal. One is its purely metaphysical aspect, as described by the learned lecturer in his "Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita;" the other terrestrial and physical, and at the same time divine from the stand-point of practical human conception and Occultism. They are all the symbols and personifications of Chaos, the “Great Deep” or the Primordial Waters of Space, the impenetrable VEIL between the INCOGNISABLE and the LOGOS of Creation. “Connecting himself through his mind with Vach, Brahma (the Logos) created the primordial waters” [SD 1, 431].
In all Cosmogonies "Water" plays the same important part. It is the base and source of material existence. Scientists, mistaking the word for the thing, understood by water the definite chemical combination of oxygen and hydrogen, thus giving a specific meaning to a term used by Occultists in a generic sense, and which is used in Cosmogony with a metaphysical and mystical meaning [SD 1, 64].
Water is the symbol of the female element everywhere; mater, from which the letter M, is derived
pictorially from a water hieroglyph. It is the universal matrix or the "Great Deep." Venus, the great Mother-Virgin, issues forth from the Sea-wave, and Cupid or Eros is her son. But Venus is the later mythological variant of Gaia (or Gaea), the Earth, which, in its higher aspect is Nature (Prakriti), and metaphysically Aditi, and even Mulaprakriti, the root of Prakriti or its noumenon [SD 2, 65].
...The "Swan or goose" (Hansa) is the symbol of that male or temporary deity, as he, the emanation of the primordial Ray, is made to serve as a Vahan or vehicle for that divine Ray, which otherwise could not manifest itself in the Universe ...It is Brahma, then, who is Kala-Hansa, and the Ray, the HansaVahana. As to the strange symbol chosen, it is equally suggestive; the true mystic significance being the idea of a universal matrix, figured by the primordial waters of the "deep," or the opening for the reception, and subsequently for the issue, of that one ray (the Logos), which contains in itself the other seven procreative rays or powers (the logoi or builders). Hence the choice by the Rosecroix of the aquatic fowl -- whether swan or pelican,* with seven young ones for a symbol, modified and adapted to the religion of every country. En-Soph is called the "Fiery Soul of the Pelican" in the Book of Numbers.
Whether the genus of the bird be cygnus, anser, or pelecanus, it is no matter, as it is an aquatic bird floating or moving on the waters like the Spirit, and then issuing from those waters to give birth to other beings. The true significance of the symbol of the Eighteenth Degree of the Rose-Croix is precisely this, though poetised later on into the motherly feeling of the Pelican rending its bosom to feed its seven little ones with its blood [SD 1, 80].
“And the Spirit of GOD moved upon the face of the Waters” (v. 2), or the great Deep of the Infinite Space. And this Spirit is Narayana, or Vishnu [SD 1, 336].
The Pythagorean Monad is also said to dwell in solitude and darkness like the "germ." The idea of the "breath" of Darkness moving over "the slumbering Waters of life," which is primordial matter with the latent Spirit in it, recalls the first chapter of Genesis. Its original is the Brahminical Narayana (the mover on the Waters), who is the personification of the eternal Breath of the unconscious All (or Parabrahm) of the Eastern Occultists. The Waters of Life, or Chaos – the female principle in



Old World Symbolism 8 symbolism – are the vacuum (to our mental sight) in which lie the latent Spirit and Matter. This it was that made Democritus assert, after his instructor Leucippus, that the primordial principles of all were atoms and a vacuum, in the sense of space, but not of empty space, as "Nature abhors a vacuum" according to the Peripatetics, and every ancient philosopher [SD 1, 64].
Compare to: “Fohat” sets in motion the primordial World-germs, or the aggregation of Cosmic atoms and matter, some one way, some another, in the opposite direction” [SD 2, 672].
In this sense ...... fire and waterstand for the spirit and matter[SD 1, 379]
4. Dragons and Serpents
“The “Dragon of Wisdom” is the One, the “Eka” (Sanskrit) or Saka. It is curious that Jehovah's name in Hebrew should also be One, Echod. “His name is Echod”: say the Rabbins. The philologists ought to decide which of the two is derived from the other – linguistically and symbolically: surely, not the Sanskrit? The “One” and the Dragon are expressions used by the ancients in connection with their respective Logoi. Jehovah – esoterically (as Elohim) – is also the Serpent or Dragon that tempted Eve, and the “Dragon” is an old glyph for “Astral Light” (Primordial Principle), “which is the Wisdom of Chaos”. Archaic philosophy, recognizing neither Good nor Evil as a fundamental or independent power, but starting from the Absolute ALL (Universal Perfection eternally), traced both through the course of natural evolution to pure Light condensing gradually into form, hence becoming Matter or Evil. It was left with the early and ignorant Christian fathers to degrade the philosophical and highly scientific idea of this emblem (the Dragon) into the absurd superstition called the “Devil”. They took it from the later Zoroastrians, who saw devils or the Evil in the Hindu Devas, and the word Evil thus became by a double transmutation D'Evil in every tongue (Diabolos, Diable, Diavolo, Teufel). But the Pagans have always shown a philosophical discrimination in their symbols. The primitive symbol of the serpent symbolised divine Wisdom and Perfection, and had always stood for psychical Regeneration and Immortality. Hence -- Hermes, calling the serpent the most spiritual of all beings; Moses, initiated in the wisdom of Hermes, following suit in Genesis; the Gnostic's Serpent with the seven vowels over its head, being the emblem of the seven hierarchies of the Septenary or Planetary Creators. Hence, also, the Hindu serpent Sesha or Ananta, “the Infinite” a name of Vishnu, whose first Vahan or vehicle on the primordial waters is this serpent.* Yet they all made a difference between the good and the bad Serpent.
* Like the logoi and the Hierarchies of Powers, however, the "Serpents" have to be distinguished one from the other. Sesha or Ananta, "the couch of Vishnu," is an allegorical abstraction, symbolizing infinite Time in Space, which contains the germ and throws off periodically the efflorescence of this germ, the manifested Universe; whereas, the gnostic Ophis contained the same triple symbolism in its seven vowels as the One, Three and Seven-syllabled Oeaohoo of the Archaic doctrine; i.e., the One Unmanifested Logos, the Second manifested, the triangle concreting into the Quaternary or Tetragrammaton, and the rays of the latter on the material plane [SD 1, 73].
Jesus accepted the serpent as a synonym of Wisdom, and this formed part of his teaching: “Be ye wise as serpents”, he says. “In the beginning, before Mother became Father-Mother, the fiery Dragon moved in the infinitudes alone” (Book of Sarparajni.). The Aitareya Brahmana calls the Earth Sarparajni, “the Serpent Queen”, and “the Mother of all that moves”. Before our globe became eggshaped (and the Universe also) “a long trail of Cosmic dust (or fire mist) moved and writhed like a serpent in Space”. The “Spirit of God moving on Chaos” was symbolized by every nation in the shape of a fiery serpent breathing fire and light upon the primordial waters, until it had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume the annular shape of a serpent with its tail in its mouth – which symbolises not only Eternity and Infinitude, but also the globular shape of all the bodies formed within the Universe from that fiery mist. The Universe, as well as the Earth and Man, cast off periodically, serpent-like, their old skins, to assume new ones after a time of rest. The serpent is, surely, a not less



Old World Symbolism 9 graceful or a more unpoetical image than the caterpillar and chrysalis from which springs the butterfly, the Greek emblem of Psyche, the human soul. The “Dragon” was also the symbol of the Logos with the Egyptians, as with the Gnostics. In the "Book of Hermes, “Pymander, the oldest and the most spiritual of the Logoi of the Western Continent, appears to Hermes in the shape of a Fiery Dragon of “Light, Fire, and Flame”. Pymander, the “Thought Divine” personified, says: The Light is me, I am the Nous (the mind or Manu), I am thy God, and I am far older than the human principle which escapes from the shadow (“Darkness”, or the concealed Deity). I am the germ of thought, the resplendent Word, the Son of God. All that thus sees and hears in thee is the Verbum of the Master, it is the Thought (Mahat) which is God, the Father ** [SD 1, 74]. * The Astral Light, or the AEther, of the ancient pagans (for the name of Astral Light is quite modern) is Spirit-Matter. Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it becomes grosser as it descends until it becomes the Maya or the tempting and deceitful serpent on our plane. ** By "God, the Father," the seventh principle in Man and Kosmos are here unmistakeably meant, this principle being inseparable in its Esse and Nature from the seventh Cosmic principle. In one sense it is the Logos of the Greeks and the Avalokiteswara of the esoteric Buddhists.
Because the "Waters" is another name of the "Great Deep," the primordial Waters of space or Chaos, and also means "Mother," Amba, meaning Aditi and Akasa, the Celestial Virgin-Mother of the visible universe. Furthermore, the "Waters of the flood" are also called "the GREAT DRAGON," or Ophis, Ophio-Morphos [SD 1, 460].
5. Tree and Serpents (Dragons)
The Symbol for Sacred and Secret Knowledge was universally in antiquity, a Tree, by which a Scripture or a Record was also meant. Hence the word Lipika, the "writers" or scribes; the "Dragons (or Serpents)," symbols of wisdom, who guard the Trees of Knowledge. ... Juno giving to Jupiter, on her marriage with him, a Tree with golden fruit is another form of Eve offering Adam the apple from the Tree of Knowledge [SD 1, 129].
It is easy to see whence the primal idea of this dual, Janus-like character of the Serpent: the good and the bad. This symbol is one of the most ancient ... and the general association of the Serpent with the tree. The legends about the various things it represents are numberless; but, as most of them are allegorical, they have now passed into the class of fables based on ignorance and dark superstition. For instance, when Philostratus narrates that the natives of India and Arabia fed on the heart and liver of serpents in order to learn the language of all the animals, the serpent being credited with that faculty, he certainly never meant his words to be accepted literally. (See De Vita Apollonii, lib. 1, c. xiv.) As will be found more than once as we proceed, the "Serpent" and "Dragon" were the names given to the "Wise Ones," the initiated adepts of olden times. ... The Nagas of the Hindu and Tibetan adepts were human Nagas (Serpents), not reptiles. Moreover, the Serpent has ever been the type of consecutive or serial rejuvenation, of IMMORTALITY and TIME [SD 1, 404].
The numerous and extremely interesting readings, the interpretations and facts about Serpent worship, given in "The Natural Genesis," are very ingenious and scientifically correct. But they are far from covering the whole of the meanings implied. They divulge only the astronomical and physiological mysteries, with the addition of some cosmic phenomena. ...As a symbol, the Serpent had as many aspects and occult meanings as the Tree itself; the "Tree of Life," with which it was emblematically and almost indissolubly connected. Whether viewed as a metaphysical or a physical symbol, the Tree and Serpent, jointly, or separately, have never been so degraded by antiquity as they are now, in this our age of the breaking of idols, not for truth's sake, but to glorify the more gross matter [SD 1, 405].
Thus, in the beginning of their joint existence as a glyph of Immortal Being, the Tree and Serpent were divine imagery, truly. The treewasreversed, and its rootsweregeneratedinHeaven and



Old World Symbolism 10 grew out of the Rootless Root of all-being. Its trunk grew and developed, crossing the planes of Pleroma, it shot out crossways its luxuriant branches, first on the plane of hardly differentiated matter, and then downward till they touched the terrestrial plane. Thus, the Asvattha, tree of Life and Being, whose destruction alone leads to immortality, is said in the Bhagavatgita to grow with its roots above and its branches below (ch. xv.). The roots represent the Supreme Being, or First Cause, the LOGOS; but one has to go beyond those roots to unite oneself with Krishna, who, says Arjuna (XI.), is "greater than Brahman, and First Cause . . . the indestructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is beyond them." Its boughs are Hiranyagharba (Brahma or Brahman in his highest manifestations, say Sridhara and Madhusudana), the highest Dhyan Chohans or Devas. The Vedas are its leaves. He only who goes beyond the roots shall never return, i.e., shall reincarnate no more during this "age" of Brahma [SD 1, 406].
Though one and the same thing in their origin, Spirit and Matter, when once they are on the plane of differentiation, begin each of them their evolutionary progress in contrary directions – Spirit falling gradually into matter, and the latter ascending to its original condition, that of a pure spiritual substance. Both are inseparable, yet ever separated. In polarity, on the physical plane, two like poles will always repel each other, while the negative and the positive are mutually attracted, so do Spirit and Matter stand to each other – the two poles of the same homogeneous substance, the root-principle of the universe [SD 1, 248].
The trunk of the ASVATTHA (the tree of Life and Being, the ROD of the Caduceus) grows from and descends at every Beginning (every new manvantara) from the two dark wings of the Swan (HANSA) of Life. The two Serpents, the ever-living and its illusion (Spirit and matter) whose two heads grow from the one head between the wings, descend along the trunk, interlaced in close embrace. The two tails join on earth (the manifested Universe) into one, and this is the great illusion, O Lanoo! Every one knows what the Caduceus is, already modified by the Greeks. The original symbol – with the triple head of the serpent – became altered into a rod with a knob, and the two lower heads were separated, thus disfiguring somewhat the original meaning. Yet it is as good an illustration as can be for our purpose, this laya rod entwined by Fig. 1 two serpents. Verily the wonderful powers of the magic caduceus were sung by all the ancient poets, with a very good reason for those who understood the secret meaning [SD1, 550].
It is only when its pure boughs had touched the terrestrial mud of the garden of Eden, of our Adamic race, that this Tree got soiled by the contact and lost its pristine purity; and that the Serpent of Eternity – the heaven-born LOGOS – was finally degraded [SD 1, 407].
The Serpent became the type and symbol of evil, and of the Devil, only during the middle ages. The early Christians had their dual Logos: the Good and the Bad Serpent.... either the early Christians, up to the VIth Century, were bond fide pagans, or that dogmatic Christianity was borrowed wholesale, and passed in full into the Christian Church – Sun, Tree, Serpent, Crocodile and all [SD 1, 410].
Instead of becoming a neophyte, and gradually obtaining his esoteric knowledge through a regular initiation, an Adam, or Man, uses his intuitional faculties and, prompted by the serpent (Woman and matter), tastes of the Tree of Knowledge – the esoteric or Secret Doctrine – unlawfully [SD 2, 202].
In the "Popol Vuh" the Third Race of men is created out of the tree Tzita and the marrow of the reed called Sibac. But Sibac means "egg" in the mystery language of the Artufas (or Initiation caves). In a report sent in 1812 to the Cortes by Don Baptista Pino it is said: "All the Pueblos have their Artufas -so the natives call subterranean rooms with only a single door where they (secretly) assemble. ... These are impenetrable temples ... and thedoorsarealwaysclosedtotheSpaniards. ... They adore the Sun and Moon ... fire and the great SNAKE (the creative power), whose eggs are called Sibac." [SD 2, 181].



Old World Symbolism 11 The serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil of India. The Arasa-Maram, the banyantree, so sacred with the Hindus (since Vishnu during one of his incarnations, reposed under its mighty shade and there taught human philosophy and sciences), is called the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. Under the protecting foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurusteachtheirpupilstheir first lessons on immortality and initiate them into the mysteries of life and death. ... To the present day Foh-tchou,* who lives in his Foh-Maeyu, or templeofBuddha, on the top of the "Kouin-long-sang," the great mountain, produces his greatest religious miracles under a tree called in Chinese Sung-Ming-Shu, or the Tree of Knowledgeand the TreeofLife, for ignorance is death, and knowledge alone gives immortality. This marvellous display takes place every three years, when an immense concourse of Chinese Buddhists assembles in pilgrimage at the holy place.
Now it may become comprehensible why the earliest Initiates and Adepts, or the “Wise Men,” for whom it is claimed that they were initiated into the mysteries of nature by the UNIVERSAL MIND, represented by the highest angels, were named the “Serpents of Wisdom” and “Dragons”...“The Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil grows from the roots of the Tree of Life” [SD 2, 215].
... the (Christian) Cross was an evolution from the "tree and the serpent," and thus became the salvation of mankind. ... The symbol of the “Tree” standing for various Initiates was almost universal. Jesus is called “the tree of Life,” as also all the adepts of the good Law, while those of the left Pathare referred to as the “witheringtrees” [SD 2, 216].
As in the Gogard, among the luxuriant branches of all those mundane trees, the "Serpent" dwells. But while the Macroscosmic tree is the Serpent of Eternity and of absolute Wisdom itself, those who dwell in the Microcosmic tree are the Serpents of the manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All; the others are its reflected parts. The “tree” is man himself, of course, and the Serpents dwelling in each, the conscious Manas, the connecting link between Spirit and Matter, heaven and earth [SD 2, 98]. See: Selden Codex et al.
The Cross and the Tree are identical and synonymous in symbolism [SD 2, 588].
Nagals and Nargals
But as to the Nagals and Nargals, whence came the similarity of names between the Indian Nagas and the American Nagals?
"The Nargal was the Chaldean and Assyrian chief of the Magi (Rab-Mag), and the Nagal was the chief sorcerer of the Mexican Indians. Both derive their names from Nergal-Serezer, the Assyrian god, and the Hindu Nagas. Both have the same faculties and the power to have an attendant daemon, with whom they identify themselves completely. The Chaldean and Assyrian Nargal kept his daemon, in the shape of some animal considered sacred, inside the temple; the Indian Nagal keeps his wherever he can -- in the neighbouring lake, or wood, or in the house in the shape of some household animal”[SD 2, 213].
Such similarity cannot be attributed to coincidence. A new world is discovered, and we find that, for our forefathers of the Fourth Race it was already an old one. That Arjuna, Krishna's companion and chela, is said to have descended into Patala, the "antipodes," and therein married Ulupi,* a Naga (or Nagini rather), the daughter of the king of the Nagas, Kauravya.**
* Ulupi has an entirely Atlantean ring about it. Like Atlantis, it is neither a Greek nor a Sanskrit name, but reminds one of Mexican names.
** "Mahabharata," Adiparva, Sloka, 7788, 7789. The "Bhagavata Purana," ix., xx., 31, as explained by Sridhera, the commentator, makes Ulupi the daughter of the king of Manipura; but the late Pundit Dayanand Saraswati, certainly the greatest Sanskrit and Puranic authority in



Old World Symbolism 12 India on such questions, personally corroborated that Ulupi was daughter of the king of the Nagas at Patala, or America, 5000 years ago, and that the Nagas were Initiates [SD 2, 214].
And now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem is proven. It is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, that of the devil; but is, indeed, the [[SEMES EILAM ABRASAX]] ("the eternal SunAbrasax"), the Central Spiritual Sun of all the Kabalists, represented in some diagrams by the circle of Tiphereth [SD 2, 214].
6. Time and Space
“Both time and space are infinite and eternal” ... “We must therefore assume that the starry heaven is not merely in space, what no astronomer doubts, but also in time, without beginning or end; that it never was created, and is imperishable” [SD 2, 154].
Esoterically – Time and Space are forms of the One incognizable Deity. As an Aditya, Indra is son of Kasyapa, as also Vaivasvata Manu, our progenitor. In the instance given in the text, he is KasyapaAditya, the Sun, and the Sun-god, from whom all the "Cosmic" Demons, Dragons (nagas), Serpent, or Snake-gods, and Danavas, the giants, are born. The meaning of the allegories given above is purely astronomical and cosmical, but will serve to prove the identity of all [SD 2, 382].
Remembering that the Puranas insist on the identity of Vishnu with Time andSpace*; and that even the Rabbinical symbol for God is MAQOM, "Space," it becomes clear why, for purposes of a manifesting Deity -- Space, Matter, and Spirit -- the one central point became the Triangle and Quaternary (the perfect Cube), hence Seven. * Vishnu is all – the worlds, the stars, the seas, etc., etc. “Vishnu is all that is, all that is not . . . . but is not Vastubhuta”, “a substance” (Vishnu Purana, Book II. ch. xii). “That which people call the highest God is not a substance but the cause of it; not one that is here, there, or elsewhere, not what we see, but that in which all is – SPACE” [SD 2, 611].
6.1. Rotatory motion and Swastica
The Swastica is certainly one of the oldest symbols of the Ancient Races. In our century, says Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie (Royal Masonic Cyclopeadia) it (the Swastica) "has survived in the form of the mallet" in the Masonic Fraternity. Among the many "meanings" the author gives of it, we do not find, however, the most important one, masons evidently not knowing it [SD 2, 556].
There was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the Cross and Circle, the Swastica, was universally adopted. With the esoteric (and, for the matter of that, exoteric) Buddhist, the Chinaman and the Mongolian, it means "the 10,000 truths." These truths, they say, belong to the mysteries of the unseen Universe and primordial Cosmogony and Theogony. "Since Fohat crossed the Circle like two lines of flame (horizontally and vertically), the hosts of the Blessed Ones have never failed to send their representatives upon the planets they are made to watch over from the beginning." This is why the Swastica is always placed – as the ansated Cross was in Egypt – on the breasts of the defunct mystics. It is found on the heart of the images and statues of Buddha, in Tibet and Mongolia. It is the seal placed also on the hearts of the living Initiates, burnt into the flesh, for ever, with some. This, because they have to keep those truths inviolate and intact, in eternal silence and secrecy to the day these are perceived and read by their chosen successors – new Initiates – "worthy of being entrusted with the ten thousand perfections... One finds it with the old Peruvians, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, as well as on the walls of the old-world cyclopean buildings; in the catacombs of the New world, and in those of the Old (?), at Rome, where, because the first Christians are supposed to have concealed themselves and their religion, it is called Crux Dissimulata [SD 2, 585].



Old World Symbolism 13 Few world-symbols are more pregnant with real occult meaning than the Swastica. It is symbolized by the figure 6; for, like that figure, it points in its concrete imagery, as the ideograph of the number does, to the Zenith and the Nadir, to North, South, West, and East; one finds the unit everywhere, and that unit reflected in all and every unit. It is the emblem of the activity of Fohat, of the continual revolution of the "wheels," and of the Four Elements, the "Sacred Four," in their mystical, and not alone in their cosmical meaning; further, its four arms, bent at right angles, are intimately related, as shown elsewhere, to the Pythagorean and Hermetic scales. One initiated into the mysteries of the meaning of the Swastica, say the Commentaries, "can trace on it, with mathematical precision, the evolution of Kosmos and the whole period of Sandhya." Also "the relation of the Seen to the Unseen," and "the first procreation of man and species." [SD 2, 587]
Thor is said to smite the head of the Serpent with his hammer ... a form of Swastica or four-footed Cross. ... In the primitive sepulchres of Egypt the model of the Chamber had the form of a Cross.** The pagoda of Mathura ... the birth-place of Krishna, was built in the form of a Cross ... [SD 2, 588].
From the beginning of man's inheritance, from the first appearance of the architects of the globe he lives in, the unrevealed Deity was recognised and considered under its only philosophical aspect -universal motion, the thrill of the creative Breath in Nature. Occultism sums up the "One Existence" thus: "Deity is an arcane, living (or moving) FIRE, and the eternal witnesses to this unseen Presence are Light, Heat, Moisture," – this trinity including, and being the cause of, every phenomenon in Nature [SD 1, 2].
6.2. Crocodile
... the Logoi of all countries and religions are correlative (in their sexual aspects) with the female Soul of the World or the “Great Deep”... And all of them had the aquatic animals and plants sacred to them, the ibis, the swan, the goose, the crocodile, and the lotus [SD 1, 353].
... It becomes the task of the fifth Hierarchy -- the mysterious beings that preside over the constellation Capricornus, Makara, or "Crocodile" in India as in Egypt -- to inform the empty and ethereal animal form and make of it the Rational Man. This is one of those subjects upon which very little may be said to the general public. It is a MYSTERY, truly, but only to him who is prepared to reject the existence of intellectual and conscious spiritual Beings in the Universe... [SD 1, 233].
6.3. 8 directions and The Poles
The Planetary Spirits are the informing spirits of the Stars in general, and of the Planets especially. They rule the destinies of men who are all born under one or other of their constellations; the second and third groups pertaining to other systems have the same functions, and all rule various departments in Nature. In the Hindu exoteric Pantheon they are the guardian deities who preside over the eight points of the compass – the four cardinal and the four intermediate points – and are called Loka-Palas, "Supporters or guardians of the World" (in our visible Kosmos), of which Indra (East), Yama (South), Varuna (West), and Kuvera (North) are the chief; their elephants and their spouses pertaining of course to fancy and afterthought, though all of them have an occult significance. [SD 1, 128].
The two poles are called the right and left ends of our globe – the right being the North Pole – or the head and feet of the earth. Every beneficent (astral and cosmic) action comes from the North; every lethal influence from the South Pole. They are much connected with and influence "right" and "left"
hand magic [SD 2, 400].
7. Spider and Web



Old World Symbolism 14 10. “FATHER-MOTHER SPIN A WEB WHOSE UPPER END IS FASTENED TO SPIRIT (Purusha), THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DARKNESS, AND THE LOWER ONE TO MATTER (Prakriti) ITS (the Spirit's) SHADOWY END; AND THIS WEB IS THE UNIVERSE SPUN OUT OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES MADE IN ONE, WHICH IS SWABHAVAT (a)”
(a) In the Mandukya (Mundaka) Upanishad it is written, "As a spider throws out and retracts its web, as herbs spring up in the ground . . . so is the Universe derived from the undecaying one" (I. 1. 7). Brahma, as "the germ of unknown Darkness," is the material from which all evolves and develops "as the web from the spider, as foam from the water," etc. This is only graphic and true, if Brahma the "Creator" is, as a term, derived from the root brih, to increase or expand. Brahma "expands" and becomes the Universe woven out of his own substance. [STANZA III (The Web of Being); SD 1, 83].
"Once disintegrated into its primal constituent by getting within the attraction and reach of a focus, or centre of heat (energy), of which many are carried about to and fro in space, a body, whether alive or dead, will be vapourised and held in "the bosom of the Mother" until Fohat, gathering a few of the clusters of Cosmic matter (nebulae) will, by giving it an impulse, set it in motion anew, develop the required heat, and then leave it to follow its own new growth.
The expanding and contracting of the Web – i.e., the world stuff or atoms – expresses here the pulsatory movement; for it is the regular contraction and expansion of the infinite and shoreless Ocean of that which we may call the noumenon of matter emanated by Swabhavat, which causes the universal vibration of atoms. But it is also suggestive of something else. It shows that the ancients were acquainted with that which is now the puzzle of many scientists and especially of astronomers: the cause of the first ignition of matter or the world-stuff, the paradox of the heat produced by the refrigerative contraction and other such Cosmic riddles ... [SD 1, 84].
One has to learn the reason of a symbol before one depreciates it. The dual element of Air and Water is that of the ibis, swan, goose and pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and water lilies, etc.; and the result is the choice of the most unseemly symbols among the modern as much as the ancient mystics [SD 1, 358].
8. Venus and Ankh
Every active power or force of the earth comes to her from one of the seven Lords. Light comes through Sukra (Venus), who receives a triple supply, and gives one-third of it to the Earth. Therefore the two are called 'Twin-sisters,' but the Spirit of the Earth is subservient to the 'Lord' of Sukra. Our wise men represent the two Globes, one over, the other under the double Sign (the primeval Svastica bereft of its four arms, or the cross. Venus is the most occult, powerful, and mysterious of all the planets; the one whose influence upon, and relation to the Earth is most prominent [SD 2, 29].
Venus (the planet) is symbolised by the sign of a globe over the cross, which shows it as presiding over the natural generation of man. The Egyptians symbolised Ankh, "life," by the ansated cross , which is only another form of Venus (Isis) , and meant, esoterically, that mankind and all animal life bad stepped out of the divine spiritual circle and fallen into physical male and female generation [SD 2, 30].
See also [Sp 1].
9. Number 7
We may now examine other ancient Scriptures and see whether they contain the septenary classification, and, if so, to what degree ... As much, if not much more, even than in the Jewish Bible, scattered about in the thousands of Sanskrit texts, some still unopened, others yet unknown, as well as in all the Puranas, the numbers seven and forty-nine (7 x 7) play a most prominent part [SD 2, 611].



Old World Symbolism 15 Now add to this the following verse from the Esoteric volumes: "Space and Time are one. Space and Time are nameless, for they are the incognizable THAT, which can be sensed only through its seven rays – which are the Seven Creations, the Seven Worlds, the Seven Laws," etc., etc., etc. ...[SD 2, 611]
“Seven seems to have been the sacred number par excellence among all civilised nations of antiquity. Why? Each separate people has given a different explanation, according to the peculiar tenets of their (exoteric) religion. That it was the number of numbers for those initiated into the sacred mysteries, there can be no doubt. Pythagoras . . . calls it the “Vehicle of Life” containing body and soul, since it is formed of a Quaternary, that is Wisdom and intellect, and of a Trinity or action and matter. The Emperor Julian, “In matrem, etc.,” expresses himself thus: 'Were I to touch upon the initiation into our Sacred Mysteries, which the Chaldees Bacchized, respecting the seven-rayed god, lighting up the soul through him, I should say things unknown to the rabble, very unknown, but well known to the blessed Theurgists.' ” (p. 141).
And who, acquainted with the Puranas, the Book of the Dead, the Zendavesta, the Assyrian tiles, and finally the Bible, and who has observed the constant occurrence of the number seven, in these records of people living from the remotest times unconnected and so far apart, can regard as a coincidence the following fact, given by the same explorer of ancient Mysteries? Speaking of the prevalence of seven as a mystic number, among the inhabitants of the "Western continent" (of America), he adds that it is not less remarkable. For:
“It frequently occurs in the Popul-vuh . . . we find it besides in the seven families said by Sahagun and Clavigero to have accompanied the mystical personage named Votan, the reputed founder of the great city of Nachan, identified by some with Palenque. In the seven caves* from which the ancestors of the Nahuatl are reported to have emerged. In the seven cities of Cibola, described by Coronado and Niza. ... In the seven Antilles; in the seven heroes who, we are told, escaped the Deluge ...”
“Heroes,” moreover, whose number is found the same in every “Deluge” story – from the seven Rishis who were saved with Vaivasvata Manu, down to Noah's ark, into which beasts, fowls, and living creatures were taken by “Sevens”. Thus we see the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, as perfect, because thoroughly mystic, numbers playing a prominent part in every Cosmogony and evolution of living Beings. In China, 1, 3, 5, 7, are called "celestial numbers" in the canonical “Book of Changes”. (Yi King, or transformation, as in "Evolution").
The explanation of it becomes evident when one examines the ancient Symbols: all these are based upon and start from the figures given from the Archaic Manuscript in the proem of Book I. , the symbol of evolution and fall into generation or matter, is reflected in the old Mexican sculptures or paintings, as it is in the Kabalistic Sephiroth, and the Egyptian Tau. Examine the Mexican MSS (Add. MSS. Brit. Mus. 9789)*; you will find in it a tree whose trunk is covered with ten fruits ready to be plucked by a male and female, one on each side of it, while from the top of the trunk two branches shoot horizontally to the right and left, thus forming a perfect (tau), the ends of the two branches, moreover, each bearing a triple bunch, with a bird -- the bird of immortality, Atman or the divine Spirit -- sitting between the two, and thus making the seventh. This represents the same idea as the Sephirothal Tree, ten in all, yet, when separated from its upper triad, leaving Seven. These are the celestial fruits, the ten or , 10, born out of the two invisible male and female seeds, making up the 12, or the Dodecahedron of the Universe ... [SD 2, 35-36].

10. Transformation of Earth and Root Races
10.1. The crucial world Epochs
Divine Dynasties
... But since traditions and even Chronicles of such dynasties of divine Kings – of gods reigning over men followed by dynasties of Heroes or Giants -- exist in the annals of every nation, it is difficult to understand how all the peoples under the sun, some of whom are separated by vast oceans and belong to different hemispheres, such as the ancient Peruvians and Mexicans, as well as the Chaldeans, could have worked out the same "fairy tales" in the same order of events.* However, as the Secret Doctrine teaches history -- which, for being esoteric and traditional, is none the less more reliable than profane history -- we are as entitled to our beliefs as anyone else, whether religionist or sceptic. And that Doctrine says that the Dhyani-Buddhas of the two higher groups, namely, the "Watchers" or the "Architects," furnished the many and various races with divine kings and leaders. It is the latter who taught humanity their arts and sciences, and the former who revealed to the incarnated Monads that had just shaken off their vehicles of the lower Kingdoms -- and who had, therefore, lost every recollection of their divine origin -- the great spiritual truths of the transcendental worlds [SD 1, 267].
Lipika, the day "Be-With-Us"
The Lipika separate the world (or plane) of pure spirit from that of Matter. Those who "descend and ascend" – the incarnating Monads, and men striving towards purification and "ascending," but still not having quite reached the goal – may cross the "circle of the Pass-Not," only on the day "Be-WithUs"; that day when man, freeing himself from the trammels of ignorance, and recognising fully the non-separateness of the Ego within his personality – erroneously regarded as his own – from the UNIVERSAL EGO (Anima Supra-Mundi), merges thereby into the One Essence to become not only one "with us" (the manifested universal lives which are "ONE" LIFE), but that very life itself. Astronomically, the "Ring PASS-NOT" that the Lipika trace around the Triangle, the First One, the Cube, the Second One, and the Pentacle to circumscribe these figures, is thus shown to contain the symbol of 31415 again, or the coefficient constantly used in mathematical tables (the value of, pi), the geometrical figures standing here for numerical figures. According to the general philosophical teachings, this ring is beyond the region of what are called nebulae in astronomy [SD 1, 129].
The Lipika (a description of whom is given in the Commentary on Stanza IV. No. 6) are the Spirits of the Universe, whereas the Builders are only our own planetary deities. The former belong to the most occult portion of Cosmogenesis, which cannot be given here. Whether the Adepts (even the highest) know this angelic order in the completeness of its triple degrees, or only the lower one connected with the records of our world, is something which the writer is unprepared to say, and she would incline rather to the latter supposition. Of its highest grade one thing only is taught: the Lipika are connected with Karma -- being its direct Recorders.**
** The Symbol for Sacred and Secret Knowledge was universally in antiquity, a Tree, by
which a Scripture or a Record was also meant. Hence the word Lipika, the "writers" or scribes;
the "Dragons," symbols of wisdom, who guard the Trees of Knowledge; the "golden" apple Tree of the Hesperides; the "Luxuriant Trees" and vegetation of Mount Meru guarded by a Serpent. Juno giving to Jupiter, on her marriage with him, a Tree with golden fruit is another form of Eve offering Adam the apple from the Tree of Knowledge [SD 1, 128].
The “Great Day of BE-WITH-US”, then, is an expression the only merit of which lies in its literal translation. Its significance is not so easily revealed to a public, unacquainted with the mystic tenets of Occultism, or rather of Esoteric Wisdom or “Budhism”. It is an expression peculiar to the latter, and as hazy for the profane as that of the Egyptians who called the same the “Day of COME-TO-US” [SD 1, 134].

10.2. The continents of the last three Root-races
Lemuria. The third Continent, we propose to call “Lemuria”. The name is an invention, or an idea, of Mr. P. L. Sclater, who asserted, between 1850 and 1860, on zoological grounds the actual existence, in prehistoric times, of a Continent which he showed to have extended from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra. It included some portions of what is now Africa; but otherwise this gigantic Continent, which stretched from the Indian ocean to Australia, has now wholly disappeared beneath the waters of the Pacific, leaving here and there only some of its highland tops which are now islands [SD 2, 7].
Atlantis. “Atlantis” is the Fourth Continent. It would be the first historical land, were the traditions of the ancients to receive more attention than they have hitherto. The famous island of Plato of that name was but a fragment of this great Continent. (See "Esoteric Buddhism.") [SD 2, 8].
America, Europe and Asia. The Fifth Continent was America; but, as it is situated at the Antipodes, it is Europe and Asia Minor, almost coeval with it, which are generally referred to by the Indo-Aryan Occultists as the fifth. If their teaching followed the appearance of the Continents in their geological and geographical order, then this classification would have to be altered. But as the sequence of the Continents is made to follow the order of evolution of the Races, from the first to the fifth, our Aryan Root-race, Europe must be called the fifth great Continent. The Secret Doctrine takes no account of islands and peninsulas, nor does it follow the modern geographical distribution of land and sea. Since the day of its earliest teachings and the destruction of the great Atlantis, the face of the earth has changed more than once. There was a time when the delta of Egypt and Northern Africa belonged to Europe, before the formation of the Straits of Gibraltar, and a further upheaval of the continent, changed entirely the face of the map of Europe. The last serious change occurred some 12,000 years ago, and was followed by the submersion of Plato's little Atlantic island, which he calls Atlantis after its parent continent. Geography was part of the mysteries, in days of old. Says the Zohar (iii., fol. 10a): "These secrets (of land and sea) were divulged to the men of the secret science, but not to the geographers" [SD 2, 8-9].
10.3. The Root Races
"Vaivasvata, thus, though seventh in the order given, is the primitive Root-Manu of our fourth Human Wave (the reader must always remember that Manu is not a man but collective humanity), while our Vaivasvata was but one of the seven Minor Manus, who are made to preside over the seven races of this our planet. Each of these has to become the witness of one of the periodical and ever-recurring cataclysms (by fireand water) that close the cycle of every Root-race [SD 2, 309].
As to the question of the four distinct races of mankind that preceded our Fifth Race, there is nothing mystical in it, except the ethereal bodies of the first races; and it is a matter of legendary, nevertheless, very correct history. That legend is universal. And if the Western savant pleases to see in it only a myth, it does not make the slightest difference. The Mexicanshad, and still have, the tradition of the fourfold destruction of the world by fire and water, just as the Egyptians had, and the Hindus have, to this day. (Lemuria was destroyed by fire, Atlantis – by water) [SD 2, 311, 316].
Thus, [SD 2, 323]: The earliest pioneers of the Fourth Race were not Atlanteans, nor yet the human Asuras and the Rakshasas which they became later. In those days large portions of the future continent of Atlantis were yet part and parcel of the Ocean floors. “Lemuria”, as we have called the continent of the Third Race, was then a gigantic land.* It covered the whole area of space from the foot of the Himalayas, which separated it from the inland sea rolling its waves over what is now Tibet, Mongolia, and the great desert of Schamo (Gobi); from Chittagong, westward to Hardwar, and eastward to Assam. From thence, it stretched South across what is known to us as Southern India, Ceylon, and Sumatra; then embracing on its way, as we go South, Madagascar on its right hand and Australia and Tasmania on its left, it ran down to within a few degrees of the Antarctic Circle; when, from Australia, an inland region on the Mother Continent in those ages, it extended far into the Pacific Ocean, not only beyond Rapa-nui (Teapy, or Easter Island) which now lies in latitude 26 S., and longitude 110 W. (See Addenda to this



Old World Symbolism 18 Book II., Section, “Proofs of the Submerged Continents”). This statement seems corroborated by Science, – even if only partially; as, when discussing continental trends, and showing the infra-Arctic masses trending generally with the Meridian, several ancient continents are generally mentioned, though inferentially. Among such the “Mascarene continent”, which included Madagascar, stretching north and south, is spoken of, and the existence of another ancient continent running “from Spitzbergen to the Straits of Dover, while most of the other parts of Europe were sea bottom”, is taught. The latter corroborates, then, the Occult teaching which shows the (now) polar regions as the earliest of the seven cradles of Humanity, and as the tomb of the bulk of the mankind of that region during the Third Race, when the gigantic continent of Lemuria began separating into smaller continents. This is due, according to the explanation in the Commentary, to a decrease of velocity in the earth's rotation:
* As shown in the Introduction, it stands to reason that neither the name of Lemuria nor even Atlantis are the real archaic names of the lost continents, but have been adopted by us for the sake of clearness. Atlantis was the name given to those portions of the submerged Fourth-Race continent which were “beyond the pillars of Hercules”, and which happened to keep above water after the general cataclysm. The last remnant of these – Plato's Atlantis, or the “Poseidon” (another substitute or rather a translation of the real name) – was the last of it some 11,000 years ago. Most of the correct names of the countries and islands of both continents are given in the Puranas; but to mention them specially, as found in other more ancient works, such as the Surya Siddhanta, would necessitate too lengthy explanations. If, in earlier writings, the two seem to have been too faintly disconnected, this must be due to careless reading and want of reflection. If ages hence, Europeans are referred to as Aryans, and a reader confuses them with the Hindus and the latter with the Fourth Race, as they live (some of them) in ancient Lanka – the blame will not fall on the writer.
“When the Wheel runs at the usual rate, its extremities (the poles) agree with its middle circle (equator), when it runs slower and tilts in every direction, there is a great disturbance on the face of the Earth. The waters flow toward the two ends, and new lands arise in the middle belt (equatorial lands), while those at the ends are subject to pralayas by submersion ...”
And again [SD 2, 323]: “... Thus the wheel (the Earth) is subject to, and regulated by, the Spirit of the Moon, for the breath of its waters (tides). Toward the close of the age (Kalpa) of a great (root) race, the regents of the moon (the Pitar fathers, or Pitris) begin drawing harder, and thus flatten the wheel about its belt, when it goes down in some places and swells in others, and the swelling running toward the extremities (poles) new lands will arise and old ones be sucked in”.
We have but to read astronomical and geological works, to see the meaning of the above very clearly. Scientists (modern Specialists) have ascertained the influence of the tides on the geological distribution of land and water on the planets, and the shifting of the oceans with a corresponding subsidence and rise of continents and new lands. Science knows, or thinks it knows, that this occurs periodically.
It is asked by some Theosophists: “What will Atlantis be like when raised?” they understanding from a few words in “Esoteric Buddhism” that “old continents” that have been submerged will reappear. Here, again, there is a slight misconception. Were the same identical lands of Atlantis that were submerged to be raised again, then they would, indeed, be barren for ages. Because the Atlantic sea-bottom is covered with some 5,000 feet of chalk at present, and more is forming – a new "cretaceous formation" of strata, in fact – is no reason why, when the time for a new continent to appear arrives, a geological convulsion and upraising of the sea bottom should not dispose of these 5,000 feet of chalk for the formation of some mountains and 5,000 more come to the surface. The racial cataclysms are not a Noah's deluge of forty days – a kind of Bombay monsoon.
Further on [SD 2, 326]: That the periodical sinking and re-appearance of the mighty continents, now called Atlantis and Lemuria by the modern writers, is no fiction, will be demonstrated in the Section in which all the proofs of the same have been collated together. The most archaic Sanskrit and Tamil works teem with references to both Continents. The seven sacred Islands (Dwipas) are mentioned in the Surya Siddhanta, the oldest astronomical work in the whole world, and in the works of Asura Maya, the Atlantean astronomer whom Professor Weber has made out re-incarnated in Ptolemy. Yet, it is a



Old World Symbolism 19 mistake to call these “sacred islands” Atlantean – as done by us; for, like everything else in the Hindu Sacred Books, they are made to refer to several things. The heirloom left by Priyavrata, the Son of Swayambhuva Manu, to his seven sons – was not Atlantis, even though one or two of these islands survived the subsidence of their fellows, and offered shelter, ages later, to Atlanteans, whose continent had been submerged in its turn. When originally mentioned by Parasara (Vishnu Purana) the seven refer to an esoteric doctrine which is explained further on. Of all the seven islands, Jambu-dwipa is the only one that is terrestrial, for it is our globe. In the Puranas every reference to the North of Meru is connected with that primeval Eldorado, now the North Polar region; which, when the magnolia blossomed there where now we see an unexplored endless desert of ice, was then a continent again. Science speaks of an ancient continent which stretched from Spitzbergen down to the Straits of Dover. The Secret Doctrine teaches that, in the earliest geological periods, these regions formed a horse-shoelike continent, whose one end, the Eastern, far more northward than North Cornwall, included Greenland, and the other contained Behring Straits as an inland piece of ground, and descended southward in its natural trend down to the British Isles, which in those days must have been right under the lower curve of the semi-circle. This continent was raised simultaneously with the submersion of the equatorial portions of Lemuria. Ages later, some of the Lemurian remains re-appeared again on the face of the Oceans. Therefore, though it can be said without departing from truth that Atlantis is included in the Seven great insular continents, since the Fourth Race Atlanteans got some of the Lemurian relics, and, settling on the islands, included them among their lands and continents, yet a difference should be made and an explanation given, once that a fuller and more accurate account is attempted, as in the present work. Easter Island was also taken possession of in this manner by some Atlanteans; who, having escaped from the cataclysm which befell their own land, settled on that remnant of Lemuria only to perish thereon, when destroyed in one day by its volcanic fires and lava. This may be regarded as fiction by certain geographers and geologists; to the Occultists it is history. What does Science know to the contrary? "Until the appearance of a map, published at Basle in 1522, wherein the name of America appears for the first time, the latter was believed to be part of India ... Science also refuses to sanction the wild hypothesis that there was a time when the Indian peninsula at one end of the line, and South America at the other, were connected by a belt of islands and continents. The India of the prehistoric ages ... was doubly connected with the two Americas. The lands of the ancestors of those whom Ammianus Marcellinus calls the “Brahmans of Upper India” stretched from Kashmir far into the (now) deserts of Schamo. A pedestrian from the north might then have reached – hardly wetting his feet – the Alaskan peninsula, through Manchooria, across the future Gulf of Tartary, the Kurile and Aleutian islands; while another traveller, furnished with a canoe, and starting from the South, could have walked over from Siam, crossed the Polynesian Islands and trudged into any part of the continent of South America.” (But see “Five years of Theosophy”, art. “Leaflets from Esoteric History”, pp. 338 and 340.) This was written from the words of a MASTER – a rather doubtful authority for the materialists and the sceptics. But here we have one of their own flock, and a bird of the same feather Ernest Haeckel, who, in his distribution of races, corroborates the statement almost verbatim: ... “It would seem that the region on the earth's surface where the evolution of these primitive men from the CLOSELY RELATED CATARRHINE APES (!!) took place, must be sought either in Southern Asia or Eastern Africa [which, by the bye, was not even in existence when the Third Race flourished H.P.B.] or in Lemuria. Lemuria is an ancient continent now sunk beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean, which, lying to the South of the Asia of today, stretched on the one hand eastwards to upper India and Sunda Island, on the other westward as far as Madagascar and Africa”. (See supra and compare “The Pedigree of Man”, p. 80-81.)
In the epoch we are treating of, the Continent of “Lemuria”, had already broken asunder in many places, and formed new separate continents. There was, nevertheless, neither Africa nor the Americas, still less Europe in those days, all these slumbering yet on the Ocean floors. Nor was there much of present Asia; for the cis-Himalayan regions were covered with seas, and beyond this stretched the "lotus leaves" of Sveta-dwipa, the countries now called Greenland, Eastern and Western Siberia, etc., etc. The immense Continent, which had once reigned supreme over the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, now consisted of huge islands which were gradually disappearing one after the other, until the final convulsion engulfed the last remains of it. Easter Isle, for instance, belongs to the earliest



Old World Symbolism 20 civilisation of the Third Race. Submerged with the rest, a volcanic and sudden uplifting of the Ocean floor, raised the small relic of the Archaic ages untouched, with its volcano and statues, during the Champlain epoch of northern polar submersion, as a standing witness to the existence of Lemuria. It is said that some of the Australian tribes are the last remnants of the last descendants of the Third Race.
In this we are again corroborated to a degree by materialistic Science. Haeckel, when speaking of Blumenbach's brown or Malay race and the Australians and Papuans, remarks: “There is much likeness between these last and the Aborigines of Polynesia, that Australian island-world, that seems to have been once on a time a gigantic and continuous continent”. (“Pedigree of Man”, p. 82).
It certainly was, since it stretched, during the Third Race, east and west, as far as where the two Americas now lie, and since the present Australia is but a portion of it, as are also a few surviving islands sown hither and thither on the face of the Pacific and a large bit of California, which belonged to it. Funnily enough, Haeckel, in his fantastic “Pedigree of Man”, considers “the Australians of to-day as the lineal descendants, almost unchanged (?!), of that second branch of the primitive human race ... that spread northwards, at first chiefly in Asia, from the home of man's infancy, and seems to have been the parent of all the other straight-haired races of men. ... The one, woolly-haired, migrated in part, westwards” ... (i.e., to Africa and northwards to New Guinea, which countries had then, as said, no existence as yet) ... “the other, straight-haired, was evolved farther to the north in Asia ... and peopled Australia ...” (p. 81). “Behold”, writes a MASTER, “the relics of that once great nation (Lemuria of the Third Race) in some of the flat-headed aborigines of your Australia” (“Esoteric Buddhism”, p. 65). But they belong to the last remnants of the Seventh Sub-race of the Third. Prof. Haeckel must also have dreamt a dream and seen for once a true vision!
It is to this period that we have to look for the first appearance of the Ancestors of those, who are termed by us the most ancient peoples of the world – now called respectively the Aryan Hindus, the Egyptians, and the oldest Persians, on the one hand, and the Chaldees and Phoenicians on the other. These were governed by the DIVINE DYNASTIES, i.e., kings and rulers who had of mortal man only his physical appearance as it was then, but who were Beings from spheres higher and more celestial than our own sphere will be, long Manvantaras hence. It is useless of course to attempt to force their existence on sceptics. Their greatest pride consists in proving their patronymic denomination as catarrhinides; which fact they try to demonstrate on the alleged authority of the Coccyx appended to their os sacrum, that rudimentary tail which, if they only had it long enough, they would wag in joy and for ever, in honour of its eminent discoverer. These will remain as faithful to their ape-ancestors as Christians will to tailless Adam. The Secret Doctrine, however, sets right on this point theosophists and students of Occult Sciences.
If we regard the Second portion of the Third Race as the first representatives of the really human race with solid bones, then Haeckel's surmise that "the evolution of the primitive men took place ... in either Southern Asia or ... Lemuria – Africa, whether Eastern or Western being out of question – is correct enough, if not entirely so. To be accurate, however, in the same way that the evolution of the First Race (from the bodies of the pitars) took place on seven distinctly separated regions of the (then) only Earth at the arctic pole – so did the ultimate transformation of the Third occur: it began in those northern regions, which have just been described a few pages back as including Behring's Straits, and what there then was of dry land in Central Asia, when the climate was semi-tropical even in the Arctic regions and most adapted to the primitive wants of nascent physical man. That region, however, has been more than once frigid and tropical in turn since the appearance of man. The commentary tells us that the Third Race was only about the middle point of its development when:
“The axle of the Wheel tilted. The Sun and Moon shone no longer over the heads of that portion of the SWEAT BORN; people knew snow, ice, and frost, and men, plants, and animals were dwarfed in their growth. Those that did not perish REMAINED AS HALF-GROWN BABES IN SIZE AND INTELLECT. This was the third pralaya of the races”.
Which means again, that our globe is subject to seven periodical entire changes which go pari passu with the races. For the Secret Doctrine teaches that, during this Round, there must be seven terrestrial pralayas, three occasioned by the change in the inclination of the earth's axis. It is a law which acts at its appointed time, and not at all blindly, as science may think, but in strict accordance and harmony



Old World Symbolism 21 with Karmic law. In Occultism this inexorable law is referred to as “the great ADJUSTER”. Science confesses its ignorance of the cause producing climatic vicissitudes and such changes in the axial direction, which are always followed by these vicissitudes; nor does it seem so sure of the axial changes. And being unable to account for them, it is prepared rather to deny the axial phenomena altogether, than admit the intelligent Karmic hand and law which alone could reasonably explain such sudden changes and their results. It has tried to account for them by various more or less fantastic speculations; one of which would be the sudden, and as imaginary, collision of our earth with a comet (De Boucheporn's hypothesis), as the cause of all the geological revolutions. But we prefer holding to our esoteric explanation, since FOHAT is as good as any comet, having, in addition, universal intelligence to guide him.
Thus, since Vaivasvata Manu's Humanity appeared on this Earth, there have already been four such axial disturbances; when the old continents – save the first one – were sucked in by the oceans, other lands appeared, and huge mountain chains arose where there had been none before. The face of the Globe was completely changed each time; the survival of the fittest nations and races was secured through timely help; and the unfit ones – the failures – were disposed of by being swept off the earth. Such sorting and shifting does not happen between sunset and sunrise, as one may think, but requires several thousands of years before the new house is set in order.
The Sub-races are subject to the same cleansing process, as also the side-branchlets (the family-Races). Let one, well-acquainted with astronomy and mathematics, throw a retrospective glance into the twilight and shadows of the Past. Let him observe, take notes of what he knows of the history of peoples and nations, and collate their respective rises and falls with what is known of astronomical cycles -- especially with the Sidereal year, equal to 25,868 of our solar years.* If the observer is gifted with the faintest intuition, then will he find how the weal and woe of nations is intimately connected with the beginning and close of this sidereal cycle. True, the non-occultist has the disadvantage that he has no such far distant times to rely upon. He knows nothing, through exact Science, of what took place nearly 10,000 years ago; yet he may find consolation in the knowledge or – if he so prefers speculation on the fate of every one of the modern nations he knows of – about 16,000 years hence.
* There are other cycles, of course, cycles within cycles – and this is just that which creates such a difficulty in the calculations of racial events. The circuit of the ecliptic is completed in 25,868 years. And, with regard to our Earth, it is calculated that the equinoctial point falls back fifty minutes ten seconds, annually. But there is another cycle within this one. It is said that "as the apsis goes forward to meet it at the rate of eleven minutes twenty-four seconds, annually," (see the article on Astronomy in Encyclopaedia Britannica), “this would complete a revolution in one hundred and fifteen thousand three hundred and two years (115,302). The approximation of the equinox and the apsis is the sum of these motions, sixty-one minutes thirty-four seconds, and hence the equinox returns to the same position in relation to the apsis in 21,128 years”. We have mentioned this cycle in Isis Unveiled, Vol. I., in relation to other cycles. Each has a marked influence on its contemporary race.
At more length the history of the preceding Continents and Root Races are considered in N. Roerich’s “The Great Seven Mysteries of the World”.



The Galactic Butterfly 1
Appendix 4
THE GALACTIC BUTTERFLY AND ITS ROOTS
1. What Does HUNAB KU Stand For?
[Hunab Ku, from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunab-ku] Hunab Ku was, to the Mayas, the supreme God and ultimate Creator. It represented the gateway to other Galaxies beyond our Sun as well as all of the Consciousness that has ever existed in this Galaxy. Hunab Ku, according to the Mayas, is also the Consciousness which organized all matter, from a "whirling disk", into stars, planets and solar systems. Hunab Ku is the "Mother Womb" which is constantly giving birth to new stars and it gave birth to our own Sun and Planet Earth. They also believed that the "Creator" directs everything that happens in our Galaxy from its center through the emanation of periodic "Consciousness Energy" bursts.
Today, modern astronomers have verified that at the center of our Galaxy is a "whirling disk" with a "Black Hole" at its center that is both swallowing and giving birth to stars. Could the strange rumblings observed by Dr. Scott Hyman and his associates earlier this year at the center of our Galaxy be connected with what the Mayas believed?
Notice also, that the ancient esoteric knowledge has been passed down the ages by the science of Sacred Geometry and now these “whirling winds” and the accompanying elements have found an interpretation in the centripetal and centrifugal forces of nature (aether vibrations) that create the torus form as the building block of matter: Russian scientist Nikolai Kozyrev [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Aleksandrovich_Kozyrev] call these waves that propagate spiralling, torsion waves. The Galactic Centre is believed to be the strongest source of torsion waves in the Galaxy and as such the GB may also represent the Galactic Centre as the torsion wave generator in our Galaxy. These may be the Galactic Waves that through the filters of the SZ and TZ reach planet Earth and drive our conscious evolution. Torsion Waves have explicitly been associated with consciousness by N. Kozyrev, whose work has been continued by Akimov and Shipov – two among hundredts of other Russian Scientists. At least a thousand papers are published on torsion physics already. To this end the following references present the interest:
“This is another valuable piece of data, as it shows us that the center of the galaxy is actually our primary source of instreaming torsion wave energy. In this case, the torsion waves appear to be propagating in tandem with the X-ray wavelengths of the electromagnetic energy spectrum.”
[www.divinecosmos.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=103&Itemid=36]
According to Sciama et al., static torsion fields are created from spinning sources that do not radiate any energy. However, once you have a spinning source that releases energy in any form, such as the Sun or the centre of the galaxy, and/or a spinning source that has more than one form of movement occurring at the same time, such as a planet that is rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun at the same time, then dynamic torsion is automatically produced. This phenomenon allows torsion waves to propagate through space instead of simply staying in a single "static" spot. Thus, torsion fields, like gravity or electromagnetism, are capable of moving from one place to another in the Universe. [http://blog.hasslberger.com/2007/05/kozyrev_aether_time_and_torsio.html ]
There appears to be a convergence between what the Mayas believed and understood and what modern scientists are discovering about our Galaxy today. One big difference is how modern physicists view and how the ancient Mayas viewed "Time". Today, physicists view Time as being linear. Time according to modern precepts flows in a straight line. Time can slow down, as per Albert Einstein, but it always flows in one direction. In contrast, the Mayas believed essentially that Time flows in a circle. There is a



The Galactic Butterfly 2
beginning and an end to things but there is a renewal at the end of the Time cycle. There is a "periodicity" to all manifested phenomena. The Mayan highly accurate Long Count Calendar is based on this precept. The Mayas also believed that Time originates out of the Hunab Ku and is controlled by it.
It is very difficult to dismiss the Mayan Cosmology because they left extraordinary evidence that their "Time" keeping methodologies give extremely accurate results. Their pyramids like the one at Chichen-Itza in Mexico are precisely aligned to the the yearly Solstices and the Equinoxes that are caused by the precession of the Earth's axis as it orbits the Sun. The Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen-Itza is essentially a superb and highly accurate Time keeping devise that never fails to mark the yearly "Precession of the Equinoxes".
The ancient Mayan astronomers accurately predicted, over 1500 years ago, the exact alignment of the Earth, the Sun, the star cluster Pleiades and of the center of our Galaxy that will take place at the end of the present long cycle on the Gregorian year 2012. On the Mayan Long Calendar the day designated as 4 Ahau 3 Kankin (13.0.0.0.0) falls on December 21, 2012 and this day will mark "El Fin de los Tiempos" or the end of the long cycle at which time humanity will experience a new beginning. On this day, according to the Mayas and subsequent Meso-American civilizations, the return of Kukulcan (Quetzalcoatl) will take place.
Pleiades. The pyramids at Teotihuacán which means "City of the Gods", constructed by a MesoAmerican civilization just north of Mexico City that preceded the Mayas, are also aligned to the Pleiades as are the Egyptian pyramids at Giza.
[www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/new10.htm#hunab] According to the official Mayanists, such as Sharer, Hunab Ku means "one god" in Yucatec Mayan language, and was the creator of the universe and equivalent to Itzamna, but "Hunab Ku seems to have figured little in the life of the ancient Maya and no representations of Hunab Ku have been identified in the codices or elsewhere."
2. Was the GALACTIC BUTTERFLY a Mayan symbol for HUNAB KU ?
2.1. The “Galactic Butterfly”
[www.mayanmajix.com/index.html]
This symbol (Fig.1) is called the Galactic Butterfly which is said to represent all of the consciousness that has ever existed in this galaxy. This is all of our physical ancestors both human, animal, reptile, fish, shell fish, plants as well as the consciousness which organized all of the raw material from a whirling disk into stars then planets and solar systems. Big Meaning. So big that the original Maya had no symbol for this. In their civilization it was like having no name for God. Just knowing the concept was good enough. Later this pattern was devised by Toltec or Zapatec weavers as a pattern for blankets and this is where Jose Arguelles came across it. He called it Hunab Ku. The indigenous peoples call it "The Galactic Butterfly". Butterflies are seen as ancestors returning for a visit to physicality. Wearing one of these symbols is very powerful as it broadcasts your reaching to actively join the consciousness of our galaxy.
2.2. Web-discussion relative to the connection between the GB symbol and Hunab Ku
[www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/new10.htm#hunab]
Hunab Ku is now, among new-age circles, synonymous with a symbol GB from the Aztec codex Maglabecchiano, and is thus thought to represent the birthplace of our Galaxy, the womb that gives birth to the stars and planets in our galaxy. However, modern Maya Daykeeper Hunbatz Men has never actually said this symbol was Hunab Ku:



The Galactic Butterfly 3
In 1986, Hunbatz Men published a book in Spanish called Religion Ciencia Maya, (published in 1990 in English as Secrets of Maya Science/Religion), he says that the Mexicas (Aztecs) worshipped Hunab Ku, and they (as well as the Mixtecs), also worshipped the Milky Way, as represented in the "G symbol" (p.40-41). Men calls Hunab Ku "The Only Giver of Movement and Measure", the Universal Consciousness and prime organizer of our Galaxy. [www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/new10.htm#hunab]
The GB symbol, is widely presumed to be a Maya representation of a major Maya deity and the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. You can find a representation of it at the centre of the Dire Gnosis logo on the index page of this website. Anthropologist John Hoopes recently asked the Year 2012 discussion group if anyone could pinpoint any Maya sculpture, ceramic vessel, or other Precolumbian Maya source where it is shown. The discussion brought out some interesting facts, summarised as follows:
The symbol became widely known when Jose Arguelles published The Mayan Factor in 1987, where it appears in circular form on the cover of the book, and as part of many illustrations. On p. 32, a rectangular version is labelled "Hunab Ku", and on p.52, the rectangular version is shown and labelled as "Hunab Ku: One Giver of Movement and Measure". On p. 30-32, Arguelles explains that in 1968, he visited a little town called Teotitlan del Valle near the Zapotec site of Monte Alban in the mountains of Oaxaca, in central Mexico, and he was shown two rugs with this pattern on them in a textile shop. He bought one in blue and orange. The connection between the title of Hunab Ku and the design is not explained by Arguelles, but seems to have come via the modern Maya day-keeper, Hunbatz Men. Arguelles says on p.40 that he met Hunbatz Men in 1985, and admits that he was heavily influenced by him.

Arguelles met Hunbatz Men in 1985, and he says, “There is no question that my meeting with Humbatz (sic) was the most crucial event in my long history of working with the Mayan material” (Mayan Factor p.40). Arguelles seems to have interpreted the symbol {GB} as an example of the Mesoamerican G symbol representing the Milky Way, as described by Men, and also seems to have got the impression that Hunab K’u is the Milky Way. On p.52 of The Mayan Factor, Arguelles describes Hunab K’u as “the galactic core”, and says, “Hunab K’u is usually translated as “One Giver of movement and Measure”. He shows the rectangular version of the {GB} symbol, labelled with Hunbatz Men’s definition: “Hunab K’u: One Giver of Movement and Measure”.
At the Yucatan site of Tancah, the murals “show striking similarities to the designs of pre-conquest Mixtec codices from the Mexican highlands...” (Sharer, The Ancient Maya p.413). Sharer also says, “Thus, as part of Mesoamerica, the ancient Maya were influenced by, and in turn influenced, their neighbouring cultures, such as the Olmecs to the northwest, on the Gulf coastal plain, the Zapotec and Mixtec of Oaxaca (west of the isthmus), the cultures centered in Teotihuacan and Tula (to the north, in Central Mexico), and the less well-known societies to the southeast in Central America” (Sharer p.20). So, though there could have been cross-over of symbology in this case, (and definitely was in other cases, e.g. in the case of the Toltec Quetzalcoatl adopted by the Yucatec Maya as Kukulcan), I think the initial Hunab-Ku – G symbol connection was actually made by Hunbatz Men, in his 1986 book Religion Ciencia Maya, which was published in English in 1990 as Secrets of Maya Science / Religion.
Though Men’s book doesn’t show the symbol we are discussing, Men says that the G symbol used by the Maya represents the Milky Way (Men, 1990, p.34), and this was also the case with the G symbol as used by the Teotihuacan people, and the Zapotecs (ibid., p.38). The G symbol as used at Mitla, Oaxaca, Mexico, and as shown on the statue of Xochipilli, god (or goddess according to Men) of the Mexicas (Aztecs) also refers to the Milky Way, according to Men (ibid. p.42). He says, “In my book, The Astronomical Calendars of the Maya and Hunab K’u, I show how the Nahua or Mexica adored Hunab K’u. They worshipped him using the names In Tloke Nahuake and Ipalnemohuani. This god was represented in the Aztec calendar, the so-called Sun Stone. In this present book, I will attempt to demonstrate that the Mexicas, as well as the Maya, worshipped the Milky Way, as represented by the



The Galactic Butterfly 4
symbolic “G”.” (ibid., p.40-41). In the text applying to Fig. 10 of his book, Men also includes the Mixtecs as venerators of “the sacred “G” as the symbolic representation of the Milky Way.”
Although Men doesn’t clearly state that Hunab K’u is the Milky Way, he could be thus interpreted in this statement; “The Maya lived integrally worshipping that which is represented by the “G”. I will reveal to you, dear reader, with all due respect for the sacred Hunab’Ku, from whom came my illumination and who enabled me to see it, the place of origin of this form. It is nothing less than our galaxy. Yes, the Milky Way!” (ibid., p.34) Also, the following quote could be thus interpreted: “For the Maya, wherever the symbol of zero is marked, its value is known, for it represents the essence of the beginning, the Logos. It is the form of the seed. Thus, it is said that (p.34) in order to understand the sacred Hunab’Ku, the Only Giver of Movement and Measure, one must venerate the origin of the zero, the Milky Way, because it is there that the mold for the most ancient things was located.”
In John Major Jenkins' 1998 book, Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, he shows the rectangular symbol, (p.329) and says it originates in the Nuttall Codex (a pre-conquest Mixtec document named after Zelia Nuttall who identified and published it), but after failing to find it in the the Nuttall codex, Hoopes contacted John Major Jenkins, who said he had seen the symbol as a frontispiece House of the Dawn - in a romance novel by Ryan, published in 1914, and also in an academic work by Zelia Nuttall, but he'd rechecked and it was not in the Nuttall Codex.
Next, I located the symbol in its rectangular form in a 1922 edition of Herbert J. Spinden's Ancient Civilizations of Mexico and Central America (p.220), with the caption, "Mexicanblanketwith the design representing sand and water".
J.M.Jenkins finally settled the matter, when he found the rectangular design in the Codex Magliabecchiano, published in 1903, with a commentary by Zelia Nuttall, which is an Aztec document and dates from some time before 1601.Hoopes went on to find that the codex shows variations of the rectangular design, and says they are "mantas" - mantles or ritual cloaks that were used in festivals - in particular, the festivaloflipplugs. The word for lipplugwas originally mistranslated as spider water, which is given in the caption. This is how the symbol {GB} appeared in the 16th century Codex Magliabecchiano:

2.3. Whether it was some other symbol for Hunab Ku?
[Peter Tompkins in "Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids" http://fusionanomaly.net/hunabku.html].
According to Martinez, the Maya came to the mathematical certainty of the existence of cosmic consciousness which they named “Hunab Ku”, sole dispenser of measurement and movement, to whom they attributed the mathematical structuring of the universe. This divinity they represented by a circle (marked out by the Authors of the article) in which was inscribed a square, just as did Pythagoras.

3. A REVIEW OF AZTEC HISTORY AND CODICES
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec ]
The Aztecs is a term used for certain Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican peoples of Central America. Sometimes it refers exclusively to the Mexica people, founders of the island city Tenochtitlan. Sometimes it also includes their two principal allies, the people of Tetzcoco and Tlacopan, with whom they built an extensive empire in the late Postclassic period in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. And sometimes it is used about all the Nahua peoples.
The nucleus of the Aztec Empire was the Valley of Mexico, where the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance, the city of Tenochtitlan was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco. After the 1521 conquest of Tenochtitlan by Spanish forces and their allies which brought about the effective end of Aztec dominion, the Spanish founded the new settlement of Mexico City on the site of the now-ruined Aztec capital. The capital of the modern-day nation of Mexico, the greater metropolitan area of Mexico City now covers much of the Valley of Mexico and the now-drained Lake of Texcoco.
The Aztecs spoke Classical Nahuatl. Although some contemporary Nahuatl speakers identify themselves as Aztecs, the word is normally only used as a historical term referring to the empire of the Mexicas. Nahuatl was originally written with a pictographic script which was not a full writing system but instead served as a mnemonic to remind readers of texts they had learnt orally.
The true origin of the Aztecs is uncertain. According to their legends, the Aztecs' place of origin was Aztlán. It is generally thought that Aztlán was somewhere to the north of the Valley of Mexico; some experts have placed it as far north as Southwestern United States. Others however suggest it is a mythical place, since Aztlán can be translated as "the place of the origin". The mythical story of these travels is recorded in a number of codices from the Spanish colonial era, most prominently the Aubin Codex and the Boturini Codex.
Based on these codices as well as other histories, it appears that the Mexicas arrived at Chapultepec in or around the year 1248.
At the time of their arrival, the Valley of Mexico contained many city-states, the most powerful of which were Culhuacan to the south and Azcapotzalco to the west. The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco soon expelled the Mexicas from Chapultepec. In 1299, Culhuacan ruler Cocoxtli gave them permission to settle in the empty barrens of Tizapan, where they were eventually assimilated into Culhuacan culture.
For the next 50 years, until 1427, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco, which had become a regional power, perhaps the most powerful since the Toltecs, centuries earlier. When Tezozomoc, the tlatoani of Azcapotzalco, died in 1426, his son Maxtla ascended to the throne. Shortly thereafter, Maxtla assassinated Chimalpopoca, the Mexica ruler. In an effort to defeat Maxtla, Chimalpopoca's successor, Itzcoatl, allied with the exiled ruler of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl. This coalition became the foundation of the Aztec Triple Alliance. The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan would, in the next 100 years, come to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific shore. Over this period, Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance, and the Triple Alliance territories became known as the Aztec Empire.
The empire reached its height during Ahuitzotl's reign, 1486 until 1502. His successor, Motecuzōma Xocoyotzin (better known as Montezuma or Moctezuma II), had been Hueyi Tlatoani for 17 years when Hernán Cortés and the Spaniards landed on the Gulf Coast in the spring of 1519.
The Aztec Empire was an example of an empire that ruled by indirect means. Like most European empires, it was ethnically very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more a system of tribute than a single system of government. In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by Alexander J. Motyl[4] the Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands, it merely expected tributes to be paid. It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected, for example the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the



The Galactic Butterfly 6
Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.
Although the Aztec form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states, known as altepetl in Nahuatl. These were small polities ruled by a king (tlatoani) from a legitimate dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepetl. Even after the empire was formed (1428) and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.
The Mexicas borrowed much of their culture from the ancient Toltec whom they seem to have at least partially confused with the more ancient civilization of Teotihuacan. To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture; "Toltecayōtl" was a synonym for culture. Mexica legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of Quetzalcoatl with the mythical city of Tollan, which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.
Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their calpōlli. Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called huēhuetlàtolli ("sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. Judged by their language, most of the huēhuetlatolli seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.
Aztecs admired Mixtec craftsmanship so much that they imported artisans to Tenochtitlan and requested work to be done in certain Mixtec styles. The Aztecs also admired the Mixtec codices, so some of them were made to order by Mixteca for the Aztecs. In the later days, high society Aztec women started to wear Mixtec clothing, specifically the quexquemetl. It was worn over their traditional "huipil", and much coveted by the women who could not afford such imported goods.
The situation was analogous in many ways to the Phoenician culture which imported and duplicated art from other cultures that they encountered. For this reason, archeologists often have trouble identifying which artifacts are genuinely Phoenician and which are imported or copied from other cultures.
Archaeologists usually do not have a problem differentiating between Mixtec and Aztec artifacts. However, the Mixtec made some products for "export" and that makes classification more problematic. In addition, the production of craft was an important part of the Mexica economy, and they also made pieces for "export".
There are few extant Aztec codices created before the conquest and these are largely ritual texts. Postconquestcodices, like Codex Mendoza or Codex Rios, were painted by Aztec tlacuilos (codex creators), but under the control of Spanishauthorities.
Aztec codices
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_codices]
There are very few surviving pre-conquest codices.
The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.
The colonial era codices not only contain Aztec pictograms, but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and occasionally Latin.
The Codex Magliabechiano was created during the mid-16th century, in the early Spanish colonial period. Based on an earlier unknown codex, the Codex Magliabechiano is primarily a religious document, depicting the 20 day-names of the tonalpohualli, the 18 monthly feasts, the 52-year cycle, various deities, indigenous religious rites, costumes, and cosmological beliefs.

SPIDERS
[www.explorit.org/homepage.html, www.tburg.k12.ny.us/mcdonald/spider.htm]
1. Within the huge group called animals are many that have no backbones. These are called invertebrates. One major group or phylum of invertebrates is called the Arthropoda. Biologists include insects and spiders in this group. Spiders and insects share some common features: e.g. as most spiders and insects grow, they molt.
2. Amongst the vast numbers of invertebrate animals in the Phylum Arthropoda, more than a million different kinds have bodies with three main parts--head, thorax, and abdomen. The head has eyes, antennae and mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of legs. The entire body is protected by a tough outer covering called an exoskeleton. Animals that share these characteristics are called insects. The group to which they belong is called the Insecta.
3. Another, smaller, group of invertebrate animals has only two main body parts. The body consists of a combined head and thorax called the cephalothorax, and the abdomen. The cephalothorax has the eyes, mouthparts (no antennae) and four pairs of legs. Animals that share these characteristics include ticks, mites, scorpions and spiders. The group is called the Arachnida.
4. Within the Arachnida, spiders are classified into a special group called the Araneae that separates the spiders from the ticks, mites, and scorpions. A distinguishing characteristic of spiders is that they have a very slender waist or pedicel separating the cephalothorax from the abdomen. The cephalothorax is covered by a tough carapace. Spiders are believed to have existed for more than 300 million years.
A spider's body consists of:
a) a cephalothorax with eyes, mouthparts - a pair of jaws and a pair of pedipalps, and four pairs of jointed legs and
b) an abdomen connected to the cephalothorax by a narrow pedicel. The entire body is encased by a tough protective exoskeleton and much of the body has sensory hairs growing from the skin.
5. Spiders have claws at the end of each leg. Spiders' legs are segmented and each leg has 7 segments: a coxa (attached to the cephalothorax), trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and finally a tarsus which may end in two or three small claws. Web-building spiders typically have three claws on the end of each leg. The middle claw and a small tuft of hairs help the spider cling on to its web.
6. Below the eyes on head end of a spider's cephalothorax are two small jaws (chelicerae) that end in fangs. Venom (poison) is produced in glands behind the jaws and empties along ducts in the fangs to paralyze or kill prey. Relatively few spiders bite people because they are not able to pierce the skin with their fangs. The majority of those spiders that can bite people have venom that is harmless to people. Two notable exceptions in the United States are the Brown Recluse, and the Black Widow
7. Most spiders have eight simple eyes. [Insects on the other hand have large, compound eyes.] The two main eyes of a spider each have a simple lens, and a retina which is made up of light sensitive cells whose surfaces point toward he light as it enters the eye. These main eyes have a small field of vision with high resolution. They are especially well developed in jumping spiders. A spider's secondary eyes also have a lens but the light sensitive cells of these eyes point away from the light as do the similar cells in a human eye. The secondary eyes detect shadows and the difference between light and dark
8. Spider webs are made of continuous strands of spider silk produced from about six silk glands beneath the abdomen. A web-spinning spider first constructs a web framework attached to parts of plants or other firm supports. This framework has threads radiating out from the centre. Next, the spider will work from the edge of the web toward the centre laying down a spiral of sticky threads.



Spiders 2
9. Spider silk is a protein that is formed as a liquid by silk glands and squeezed out of spinnerets like toothpaste from a tube. The liquid thread hardens as it leaves the spinneret and some types of such thread become stronger than a steel thread of the same diameter. Most of the silk threads in a spider web are multiple strands of fine silk lying alongside each other. Spiders produce several types of silk from different types of spinning glands. One type of silk formed by all spiders is the type used for wrapping prey. Another type of silk is used to make the egg sac, and yet other is a sticky type often used as part of a web.
Young spiders ride the wind on long silk threads in a process that we call ballooning.
There are now about 35,000 named species of spiders worldwide
10. Funnel-Web Spiders (Order Araneae, Family Agelenidae). These small to medium sized spiders under 20mm long - spin sheet webs of non-sticky silk with a funnel extending from the centre to one edge and a barrier web over the top to catch insects. The spider sits in the funnel. When a flying insect hits the barrier and falls onto the sheet web the spider rushes out of the funnel, bites the victim to paralyze it, and drags it into the funnel to feed on it.
11. An unusual member of this family is the water spider (Argyroneta). This spider feeds on small water organisms and spends its life below the surface of lakes and ponds living in a bubble of air held in the water by a silken diving bell or thimble-like structure.
Types of spider web
[http://en.allexperts.com/e/s/sp/spider_web.htm, www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/spidermyth/myths/general.html]
There are numerous types of spider web found in the wild; and many spiders are classified by the webs they weave. Different types of spider webs include, but are not limited to:
* Spiral orb webs, associated primarily with the family Araneidae , Tetragnathidae and Uloboridae; * Funnel-webs, with associations divided into primitive and modern; * Tubular webs which run up the base of trees * Sheet webs
* Tangle-webs or cobwebs, associated with the family Theridiidae.
Although orb webs are the most conspicuous webs (because they tend to be large and are often suspended in mid-air) they are not at all the most common type. In temperate regions, sheet webs are by far the most common, and cobwebs are also more abundant than orb webs. In some locations, funnel webs are also more common. Only in the tropics can orb webs equal other web types in abundance, but they still are rarely in the majority. So when you notice a spider web that is not a round orb, rest assured that it's perfectly normal.
Examples of 4 major types of spider webs
Each functions somewhat differently in prey capture. Sheet webs and funnel webs have no sticky silk.
