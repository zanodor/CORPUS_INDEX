INTRODUCTION.
Lebor GabCila Erenn, a title which we can Lest translate
literally, "the Book of the Taking- of Ireland," is a compilation which professes to narrate the history of the successive colonists of that country. The earlier Redactions have come down to us, in whole or in part, in fifteen mss.
(counting F, V, as one each, but counting separately the two versions in the Book of Lecan). These have been enumerated in the foregoing table, and are more fully described below. For critical purposes, however, the number has to be
reduced to eleven. A is a direct (and very poor) copy of
D, and gives us nothing that D cannot supply : while ft ft
1 /3
2
are all derivatives from B, and are thus of no use except to
restore one folio, which B lost at some time after they were written. Although these manuscripts agree, on the whole, in the facts, or alleged facts, which they set forth, the words in which they state them differ profoundly. They fall into redactional groups, essentially at variance in the selection and order of presentment of the narratives, and in the language in which these are expressed. The editor has no alternative but to print them in extenso, independently of
one another. 1 A single composite text, with an unmanageably cumbrous sediment of variae lectiones at the bottom of the page, would be perfectly useless for any critical student of
this important document and of its complex history. It may be said that this conclusion has not been reached without
experiment.
1 There are a few places in which this is not necessary, but these are exceptional.

x INTRODUCTION.
The work is primarily paedagogic, for which purpose it is interspersed with mnemonic sets of verses, intended to be
Learned off by heart. To the modern reader these verses are
an un mitigated nuisance, rarely adding anything to what he has already learnt from the prose text; nevertheless it is clear that they are the foundation on which the whole work, in its present form, is based. The corpus of historical verse became the common reservoir of knowledge upon which the prose compilers drew ; and the selections which they made therefrom dictated the selection of facts which they set forth in the several redactions. For this reason, the treatment of the verse has to be different from that of the prose : it has been found most convenient (again after experiment) to separate the verse texts from the prose, and to print them independently. It is probable, indeed, that this is a return to the practice
of the original prose redactors; that they did not write out the verse compositions in full, but merely jotted down as cues the opening words of each in the margins of their mss., in the confidence that their readers would already have these texts securely in their heads, as they themselves had. In
fact, the manuscript R gives us no more than such jottings, incorporated, it is true, in the text, but not extending beyond the first quatrain of any poem. It is conceivable that this
is not the mere shirking of a lazy scribe, but that it is an actual survival of a traditional custom. 2 This suggestion is corroborated by the diversity of the formulae introducing the poems, even in mss. which otherwise have close verbal
similarity. As dia chuimniugiid-sain: de quibus hoc carmen:
[so-and-so] cecinit—these and similar expressions are used, even in nearly related mss., at random, making it clear that in this matter the scribes had no stereotyped exemplars to
keep their copies uniform. We infer, therefore, that in the autographs these formulae of introduction were not present; and that they were inserted only after the scribes had realized that human memory is untrustworthy, and that it was wiser to write out the poems in full. The same conclusion is
2 Some few of the poems are written in full in fiB.



INTRODUCTION. xi
indicated by the divergent forms of proper names sometimes appearing in the verse texts and in the associated prose.
Tims in B, ff 156 ff., we find several times the name
' ' Caithear, " but in the parallel poem no. XIV it appears as "Caicher."
The Extant Manuscripts.
There are in all five redactions of the text : Mm, R1
, R2
,
R
3
, and K, the last being O'Clery's3 modernised version. Postponing the questions of their contents, origins, and mutual relationships, we may here briefly describe the manuscripts upon which an edition of the text has to be based. Owing to the convenience of denoting a manuscript by a single letter only, I have taken the liberty of adopting symbols for certain well-known codices, different from those in ordinary use. Thus, I call the Book of Leinster L, not
LL : the Book of Ballymote B, not BB : and for the two texts in the Book of Lecan, instead of Lee1 and Lee2 (which would be too clumsy for constant reference), I have adopted the symbols A and M. The latter may be read and explained (at the reader's pleasure) not as "em," but as "lambda two."
The First Redaction.
Only two mss. of R1 survive, namely, L and F.
L. The Book of Leinster (T.C.D. Library, H.2.18), c. 1150 a.d. In this codex, which is too well-known to need
description, our text occupies folios 1-13.
The folios measure about 12-7 X 9 inches4
; and bear four columns, with about 51-53 lines of writing in each. The recto of the first folio must have for long remained unprotected by a binding, in consequence of which the writing is rendered partly illegible by dirt, wear, and other injury.
3
: I use the anglicised form here, because the genitive case of the native form cannot be accommodated to an English context :
"5 Cleirigh's" is gibberish.
4 In this and the other mss. these measurements vary slightly from folio to folio; the vellum is not cut with mechanical uniformity.



xii INTRODUCTION.
The pest, ;is a whole, is readable enough; though the edges of
some of the folios are frayed, and, throughout, many of the
words and Letters are thus damaged or lost. A transcript of
the first 1 1:> pages of the MS., line for line and page for page, was made in 1852 by Eugene 'Curry (L.5.20 in T.C.D. Library). This is often useful in restoring writing that has become illegible since his time; but it cannot be trusted with full confidence, and he has shirked the task of trying to decipher the first page, where his help would have been of the utmost value.
F. The Book of Fermoy (R.I.A. Library, 23 E. 29). The
connexion of this copy of LG with the Book of Fermoy is factitious and partial only. It is written upon twenty-two folios of vellum, of which the first eight form a gathering, bound into the front of the Book of Fermoy : the remaining fourteen I had the good fortune to identify in one of the Stowe mss. (R.I.A. Library, D.3.1). The folios measure on an average 10-5X8 ins. There are 31 lines of writing in each column, and two columns on each page. The Fermoy fragment, and the first two folios of the Stowe fragment, are written upon in a coarse, bold hand, using very black ink and a broad-pointed pen on which the writer leans heavily.
Dr. Best identifies the handwriting as that of Adam
6 Cianain of Lisgoole, County Fermanagh, whose obit is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters at a.d. 1373. On the third folio of the Stowe fragment (fol. 11 of the complete book), in column a, after line 27, the handwriting appears to change abruptly: but careful comparison shows that the same scribe continues to work, using a pen with a finer point. On the same folio, however, column 8, after
line 4, there is actually a change of scribe, s2 F has a
rounder, and, on the whole, a better style of handwriting than s 1 V. At first he decorates his capital letters with blobs of
colour, though not on the later pages : he is fond of ending
them with crudely drawn animal heads, which s1 F never
does. A Her the change of the pen in the hand of s1 F, the number of lines in the column increases to 39. The whole work ends abruptly at 22 y 10, with the reign of Eochaid Qairches in the "Roll of the Kings." The remainder of



INTRODUCTION. xiii
column y, and the whole of column 8, of this folio were left
blank, suggesting that the copy stopped at this point because the remainder was lost from a/F : an irrelevant anecdote about King David and a beggar has at some later time been
scribbled into the empty space. 5 An additional leaf, possibly
part of the earliest binding of the book, originally blank, is also now covered with scribbling. As in the case of L, the
recto of the first folio of F is in a very bad condition from
wear, tear, and dirt. It was cleaned chemically during the progress of the present work by Professor Ditchburn, of T.C.D., with the satisfactory result that most of the text, which I had abandoned as hopelessly illegible, proved recoverable. It should be noted that the folios in the Stowe ms., as at
present bound, are misplaced. The first, which follows immediately after the last folio of the Fermoy fragment, is bound in as the seventh folio of the Stowe book. 6 The text carries on from there to the present end of the volume (eight
folios) : then continues on the prefixed folios in this order
6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 7
Of the lost mss. of the First Redaction, *Q and *X, which are of considerable critical importance, we shall speak when
occasion arises. *Q was the copy used by oo R3
,
# X was used
by one of the glossators of R2
.
The redaction called Mlniugud, which is a form of R1
, is
more fully discussed below.
The Second Redaction.
The majority of the mss. of LG belong to R2
. These are V, E, P, R, D, A, and A.
5 Edited by S. H. O 'Grady from two other MSS.; see Melusine iv (1888), col. 163. See also K. Meyer in Arch, fwr Celt. Lex. iii 321 for a different version. 6 The bottom margin of this leaf has been clipped off, apparently to remove some scribbled matter : there is similar scribbling on the bottom margin of the following folio, recto. 1 In references to this MS,, in the present edition, the folios are numbered in their true order, not in the haphazard order in which they are bound.



xiv INTRODUCTION.
V, a ms. in the Stowe collection (R.I.A. Library), now
divided into three volumes (V1 = D.5.1, V2 = D.4.1, and
V
3 = D.1.3). V1 consists of nine folios, with four columns
of writing on each; size of leaves 11 '8 X 8 ins., 51-55 lines of writing in each column. At the beginning there is an elaborately coloured interlaced monogram of the word in : and throughout there are well-drawn initial letters. The whole is written in a beautiful neat hand, which, however, is rather cramped, and not perfectly easy to decipher. The ms. has undergone extensive re-inking, and it is not always certain that the restorer has done his work accurately. At
the top of folio la of V1 there are two faint, worn lines of
writing in Gothic lettering—apparently a library mark ; under ultra-violet light they seem to read M.onasterii Insi Putraic, but they are too far gone to yield with assurance even to that
powerful solvent of palasographieal difficulties. V2 has eight,
V
3 six folios : they are on the whole better preserved than
V
1
, wThich has suffered severely from wear. In V2 the wrriting
stops abruptly at 8 8 9 (end of the poem Fland for Erind hi
Ugh), after which the rest of the column is blank. We must
infer that a gathering had been lost from V V, and that the
scribe of V was unable to find means of filling the lacuna. 8 The gap extends to the end of the 13th quatrain of the poem Gdedel glas in Min : with the 14th quatrain the text
resumes abruptly, on the first folio of V 3
, and runs on to the end of Erin ardinis na rlgh, which finishes the ms. There
are coloured initials in V1 and V2
, but not in V 3
: bat the style of the writing, the size of the folios, and the number of lines in the column, leave no room for doubt that the three volumes originally formed one book. Fragments of other books, in vellum and in paper, quite irrelevant in contents,
are now bound up with the twTo later volumes.
8 The lacuna does not exist in the closely cognate copy a ; the text
here runs on intact over rather more than 8 leaves of A which have no equivalent in V. This clearly shows that a is not, as has been
supposed, a transcript of V: it must be derived from f V at latest.
In /iV the Roll of the Kings originally stopped at Sirna Soeglach, and
has been continued in a different but contemporary hand : fi A knows
nothing of this, and breaks off at Sirna—another demonstration that the two MSS. are not in "mother-and-daughter" relationship.



INTRODUCTION. xv
E, a manuscript once bound up in separate folios scattered through a miscellany of scraps class-marked E.3.5 in T.C.D. Library (Gwynn's Catalogue, no. 1433, p. 308) : now collected once more into a single volume, and class-marked E.3.5., no. 2.
It contains 16 folios, measuring 11-4 X 8-25 ins., with four columns of 48 lines of writing on each. There is hardly any ornamentation. The handwriting was recognised long ago by 'Curry (Battle of Magh Leana, p. 35, footnote) as that of
Toma o Maeil-Chonaire, poet and historian to the earls of Desmond at the beginning of the fifteenth century : and this is confirmed by a scribal note at the bottom of folio 2 y. He
wrote carelessly ; haplographies are frequent, usually corrected in the margin by himself or by a later reader. Many of the lenited letters, which were not dotted by the original scribe, have been dotted by a later meddler. On the other hand, there are many good readings, and the ms. is of considerable
critical importance. A note at the bottom of fo. 9 verso claims ownership of the book for Muirges ruadh ua MaoilChonaire (a different person from the scribe of D), "wherever it may be found."
P, formerly in the Phillips Collection at Cheltenham, now in the National Library of Ireland, class-marked P. 10266.
It has been described by Whitley Stokes, 9 who has, however,
not observed that the fragment of LG (which he does not appear to have identified as such) is only by accident a part
of the book. It is a single quaternion, 10 X 73 ins., prefixed to a fragment from another ms. with folios of a rather larger
size. Only the first two folios contain LG material, and there does not appear ever to have been any more of the text. The writing is minute, running across the whole page in a single column of 41 lines. Polio 1 recto is utterly illegible, the whole page having been reduced with gallic acid and dirt
to a uniform dead brownish black. A large monogram of IN, extending down the whole height of the page on the left-hand side, and followed (apparently) by PRI, in unusually large characters, can be traced; but nothing further. The rest of

XVI INTRODUCTION.
the texl is clear, extending from -\ nl derna fdilte (fl 5A) to risin mac mbec rugad (]} 119), where the scribe ceased abruptly from hjs work. Some parts of Folio 1 verso (the first nine lines and the poem No. 1) have been re-inked, not quite accurately. Though so fragmentary, the text is useful, as it helps considerably in the decipherment of some obscure passages in VE, the only other mss. which have preserved
the firsl folio of the text of R2
. There is no colophon: but Arabic figures are freely used in the text, and this and other indications suggest a date of about 1480-1520.
R, the only ms. of the older versions not in Dublin, is an
early fifteenth-century copy contained in the well-known miscellany, Rawl. B. 512, in the Bodleian Library. This ms.
has been described, and its contents catalogued, by Whitley Stokes 10
; and it is here needless to go over the same ground.
The text of LG occupies foil. 76 recto-100 verso. The beginning of the book is lost : calculation shows that two
leaves are gone; possibly three, if (as is improbable) the text contained the Nel-Moses pericope (|J 118 ff.) and the long
poem V written out in full. Another leaf has disappeared between fifl 272-288. These defects took place before the addition of pagination to the ms., which ignores them. Two folios aro numbered 76, the second being distinguished as
76 A -. the first two folios are transposed in the binding. There are two columns upon each page, with 37 lines of
writing in each column. At the end of the text of R2 there comes the copy of Miniugud here called [xR.
D, class-marked Stowe D.4.3 in the R.I. A. Library.
This is a vellum ms., the pages being 9X7-5 inches, with two columns of writing upon every page except the recto of fol. 7, and the lower part of the recto of fol. 21, in which the writing runs across the page with about 56 letters in each line. The book seems to have been exposed to fire at some time: the lower and outer edges, and especially the lower
Tripartite Life of St. Patrick (Rolls Series), vol. i, p. xivff.



INTRODUCTION. xvii
outer angles, of most of the folios are badly scorched, and the writing on the parts affected is often difficult to read.
The lines of writing are very irregularly disposed ; so far as I have counted them, they range in number from 29 to 41 in the column. Appropriately to this irregularity, the handwriting is poor, sometimes not very legible. Forty-two folios remain : two have been lost from the beginning, and the end is also imperfect. The ms. is of considerable critical value, and has some remarkable readings11
: the scribe's name,
Muirges (or Muirgius) mac Paidin, appears in scribbles at 17 y bottom, 25 /3 14, and 35 8 bottom. In the last place only has he given his father's name, and this has been partly
burnt away. He is a grumbler : at the bottom of 8 y, in a note now difficult to decipher, he appears to complain that his ruler is too broad; on 11 y he is troubled because his light is bad ; at 17 y he has mislaid his cailc, that is, presumably, the pumice with which he smoothed the surface of his vellum; and on 11 recto the shears of a bookbinder have silenced a reference derogatory, as we may suppose, to his parchment. In the present work the two lost initial leaves are counted in, in references to this ms. ; the first extant folio being numbered "3," in accordance with the old pagination. In the ms. a new pagination, starting from the first extant folio, has been substituted in roughly written numerals, the old pagination being sometimes either scratched out or written over. The scribe was certainly the Muirges mac Paidin ua Maoil-Chonaire who made the transcript of the Book of Fenagh in the R.I.A. Library in 1517, and who died in 1543. Though the writing in the Fenagh volume is much more careful, comparison of the two books leaves no room for doubt that they come from the same hand. This being so,
we may infer that this ms. is the same as "The Book of
"Among- these are a number of interpolations, evidently borrowed
from a copy of R1
, and all marked in the margin of the page as Slicht
Libuir na Huidri, "An extract from (literally, [following in] The track
of) Lebor na Huidri." This records the fact that a copy of LG, in the
R
1 Redaction, was included among the (now missing) contents of that
MS.



xviii INTRODUCTION.
Bailc ui Maoil-Chonaire, written by Muirghes mac Paidln ui Maoil-Chonaire out of Leabhar na Huidhri," which Cleirigh specifies as one of the sources of his own work. The marginal notes referred to in the footnote have misled him into supposing that the whole book was copied from LU. See further on the ms. A, below.
A, the first text in The Book of Lecan (R.I. A. Library,
23.P.2). The impending publication of a facsimile of this important volume makes it unnecessary to describe it here : in the published catalogue of the Royal Irish Academy's collection of mss. there is a full analysis of its contents. This text is at the beginning of the book, and has lost the first nine folios : they were already gone in 1724. 12 In consequence the copy begins abruptly in the section relating to the FirBolg (in the middle of the poem appended to
ff 292). The complete text, including the copy of Min.
appended to R2 (here called /*A), covered 30 folios, with two columns on each page, containing 41-55 lines of writing, so far as they have been tested. It ends in the middle of
column 30 8, with the following colophon, repeated immediately below by a later hand in a different ink: Finit.
Adam o Cuirrtin do sgrib do Gilla Isu mac Firbissigh A.
d'ollam o Fiachrach, Anno. Do', M° CCCC° xuiij°. "It
endeth. Adam 6 Cuirnin wrote it, for Gilla Isu mac Fir
Bisigh, the man of learning of the Ui Fiachrach, A.D. 1418."
This is the most exactly dated copy of the text which we possess. Many of the folios have become semi-transparent
by contamination with some greasy substance, and the writing
on the one side shows through to the other, making decipher
ment difficult.
A
is the only extant paper ms. (excluding some eighteenth century copies, mentioned below) of any of the pre- Cleirigh
redactions. It is Stowe A.2.4 in the R.I.A. Library, and
'-Bishop Nicolson, Irish Historical Library, p. 38. The leaves from
this ms. now bound into H 2 1?, in the library of T.C.D., are not
those missing from the beginning of the codex, as is stated bv an
oversight in the catalogue of the T.C.D. Irish Manuscripts, p. 112.



INTRODUCTION. xix
apparently belongs to the seventeenth century. There are
47 leaves, 7-8X58 ins., some of them much tattered. I have collated this copy sufficiently to assure myself that it is a direct transcript of D. It reproduces slavishly the orthographical and other peculiarities of D, except for the not infrequent mistakes of its own copyist. Some of these mistakes can be explained, on reference to D, by obscurities in
the script of the earlier ms. A is imperfect at both ends, and has no independent value for the criticism of the text : it has just the slight importance that in a few cases it does not reproduce corrections that have been made secunda iiianu in D, suggesting that these may have belonged to a time later
than its own transcription. But sA was so incompetent that we cannot be sure even of this : he may have overlooked them, or omitted them intentionally. In the present edition of LG,
A has been left out of consideration altogether.
Assuming that D was one of the sources followed by
Cleirigh, A was probably prepared for his use—not, however, by him, as it is not in his handwriting. Some leaves of a different text, which though roughly scribbled appear
actually to be in O'Clery's writing, are bound up in the same volume.
A lost ms. of this redaction, *Z, will be referred to as

of the eighteenth century, when two transcripts of the text

were made from this jis. One of these, written in 1728 by
Richard Tipper, here called /?, is fairly good, though not perfect ; and it is of great value for restoring the text of the
missing folio. It is labelled on the binding "Book of Ballymote," and class-marked H.2.4 in T.C.D. Library (Gwynn's

pitifully illiterate production, class-marked Stowe D.3.2 in the R.I. A. Library. These two mss. share a considerable
number of mistakes and peculiar spellings, showing their descent from a common more or less inaccurate original
(V/2 12
) interposed between them and the ancestral B 13
; and they are both so much inferior to /?, that their only use is to corroborate some of its peculiar readings, and to show that tlu'se were really to be found in the missing leaf of B. In
very few cases can we accept a divergent reading of V/3 12
in preference to [3. Where we have B intact, these three copies are useless, and are here ignored. Folios 21—30 were
lost from B before any of them was made : /? does not
attempt to supply the deficiency; but \//3 12 has filled it by copying from the still extant jjlV, for collation shows beyond
the possibility of doubt that s\/ /3

misled by peculiarities in /xV (misspellings, a badly set-out cor fa clxasdn, imperfectly legible writing, etc.). The version of this missing portion in (3

I allow this to stand, because it is still possible as a statement of
the facts : but on subjecting my collations to a final revision, when I
considered the relationship between these two mss. more closely, and
noted a number of places where a peculiar error in f3

as a direct (though poor) copy of B, and /?= a yet worse copy of /3

The hypothetical V/312 thus disappears altogether, and /J

INTRODUCTION. xxi
M
is the second text in The Book of Lecun, occupying folios 264-312. 14 It is a very peculiar text, having some interpolations (notably the story of Partholon's faithless wife
Delgnat) not found in any other ancient version. yM was
apparently imperfect: certainly the latter half of the "Roll
of the Kings ' ' was missing from it, and s M was compelled to supply the deficiency by a makeshift adaptation of a version of the saga of the Borama Tribute, differing in some respects from that in the Book of Leinster. The important lacuna in the first section of LG, to be described later, was also a serious imperfection in yM. The problems connected with this copy must, however, be considered as they arise.
The copyist of M was working against time. Even when he was called away for a few minutes, a deputy (s2 M) took his place, and wrote during his absence. The text is, so to
speak, punctuated by short groups of lines in the very distinctive handwriting of s 2 M, which alternate with the work of the main scribe (s
1 M), changing sometimes even in the middle of a line. There is never any crowding or over
running, as would be the case if s 2 M were a later scribe, filling in gaps that for any reason had been left by a pre
decessor. Presumably the writers of M could not obtain the
use of yM for more time than wTas just sufficient for their
work. As in such a case they would not have leisure to hunt for extraneous matter, it seems probable that the inter
polations and other peculiarities of M were all transferred to that ms. bodily from yM. It is further possible that they
were deprived of it before they were able to copy the wThole of the Roll of the Kings, and that this, rather than a
deficiency in yM, is the explanation of the peculiarity noticed in the preceding paragraph.
H
is a fragment of five folios, 13' 5 X 9- 6 ins., with two columns on each page, and 56 lines of writing in the column. It is bound into a volume of miscellaneous fragments
(H.2.15, no. 1, in T.C.D., Gwynn's Catalogue, 1316).
14 Throughout this edition the old foliation of the Book of Lecan, in the upper right-hand corner of the recto of each folio, is used for
reference, instead of the more recent pagination in square brackets in the bottom margin.



xxii INTRODUCTION.
Pour of these folios belong to the first section of LG, and contain matter nowhere else extant. The fifth has a version of tlir end of the Nemed section, cognate with that in K, and differing profoundly from every other text of this part
of the book. With this the H copy of LG appears to have ended, the remainder of the folio being occupied with other matter. At the end of this folio there is a colophon which would seem to date the MS. to some time before 1252 (see
Gwynn's Catalogue, p. 91), but the interpretation of the note is uncertain, and the date seems, if anything, too early for the Jan image and especially the orthography of the ms. It is the pages, not the folios, in this miscellany which are numbered
(as under, in pencil). 15 The first portion of LG occupies
pp. 97-104, but the folios are not in their right order—they
should run thus, 103-104, 97-98, 101-102, 99-100. The Nemed fragment is in the first column of page 67. About one-third of the upper portion of folio 103-104 has been torn away and lost.
In preparing for publication the three prose texts, I have
chosen L, V, and B as the standard copies of R1
, R2
, and R3 respectively; and the book is printed as it appears in those mss., except where some other fills a lacuna, or corrects an obvious error. Numerals, as well as the ordinary abbrevia
tions and contractions, are expanded silently ; and the marking
of long vowels, which is quite haphazard in the mss., is reduced to some sort of order (with horizontal strokes). In
the tables of variants, and in places where a passage depends
on one ms. only, the marking of prolongation (with accent-like strokes), is reproduced as in the original16
: except on the
5 There is an older, now obsolete, pagination in ink, which we may ignore.
18 In a few cases marks of prolongation, inserted before I decided
to give without such interference passages depending on a single lis.,
have evaded deletion and appear on the printed page. I have allowed
them to stand, to avoid needless proof-correction: but these apart, the
absence of such marks will be a useful indication to the reader that
the text before him survives in one ms. only. In English contexts,
meticulous accentuation has not been considered necessary.



INTRODUCTION. xxiii
letter i, where the accent-like mark is usually nothing more than a distinguishing mark, like the dot in ordinary print. This is here left out. I also omit the punctum delens placed over "eclipsed" letters. By repeated collations an effort has been made to attain to the ideal of recording every variant, however trifling, presented by the manuscripts. The three mss. specified have been chosen, less because they are the best copies of their respective redactions than because they
are the most complete. In fact, F probably is nearer to
co R1 than L ; and the late mss. of R2
, DER, often give
readings preferable to those in V. M is admittedly more
complete than B, but it has too many eccentric readings and interpolations to justify its being selected as the standard
for R3
.
The verse texts cannot be classified into "redactions," and they have to be treated in a different way. Of these I have endeavoured to construct a text, giving the reader as full an apparatus criticus of variant readings as possible, to enable him to test, and, it may be, to improve upon it. I have not, however, attempted to standardize the orthography, which would involve an interference with the testimony of the mss. that I felt would be too drastic. The text does not need to be treated like a Greek classical composition, where it is of the first importance to recover the exact words of the literary master who wrote it. The ideal which I have set before myself is the humbler one, of making it possible for
a scholar to whom the mss. are inaccessible to reconstruct the text of any one of them, except, in the matter of abbreviations
and marks of vowel prolongation. To have attempted to reproduce all of these would have more than doubled the bulk of the lists of variae lectiones, with no very apparent advantage. This is not to say that they are unimportant : on the contrary, I have gleaned some valuable hints on the affiliation of mss. from a comparison of such extraneous matters as the ornamentation of initial capital letters, and the abbreviations or other peculiarities of the caligraphy (or cacography) of individual words. In this connexion it may be said here that it is especially interesting to compare the initial letters scattered throughout
V with those in D. In V they are neatly drawn and coloured,

though in design they show only too clearly that the art to
which they belong was already moribund or dead : in D they are badly drawn, in an ink outline only. But it is obvious that
they are the same designs. As D cannot possibly be a copy of V, it is clear that the two mss. derive their ornamentation,
like their text, from a common original. This fact, which gives us a new criterion for determining the affinity of manuscripts, may be illustrated by the specimens here reproduced.,163 from tracings made with the kind consent of the Council of the R.I.A.
O'Clery's Redaction.
K has already been published as far as the Boll of the Kings, and need not here be repeated. It is of little critical
value, having been much manipulated editorially, but there is enough to show that its compiler had access to mss. no
longer extant. He has a long version of the Partholon
Delgnat story, differing from that in M almost throughout : and his Nemed text, though it has affinities with the unique text in H, displays a like independence. The chief importance of this version is its rich glossarial matter. The last degeneration of the text is found in two nineteenth century mss. in the British Museum (Egerton, 101, 105), which give us O'Clery's version with some of the difficulties cut out and easy bits of Keating 's History substituted.
The Contents of the Book.
The book in its present form, in all the principal
redactions, falls into ten separate and independent sections,
as under
I. From the Creation to the Dispersal of the Nations. II. The Ancestors of the Gaedil. III-VII. The successive invasions of Cessair, Partholon, Nemed, the
Fir Bolg, and the Tuatha De Danann. VIII. The invasion of the sons of Mil, i.e. of the Gaedil. IX. The Roll of the Kings before Christianity. X. The Roll of the Kings after Christianity.

xxvi INTRODUCTION.
—and notwithstanding the profound differences in detail
between the different redactions, they agree in the main lines of their contents. Prof. A. C. Clark, in a work to whose teaching I gladly
acknowledge my indebtedness, 17 has laid it down as a principle
that "a text is like a traveller who goes from one inn to another, losing an article of luggage at each halt." By this he means, that the text sheds passages piecemeal as it is
copied from manuscript to manuscript ; so that when delivered to its reader at the end of a succession of transcriptions, it
is shorter—often considerably so—than when it left the author's hand, to run the gauntlet of scribal carelessness, sleepiness, incompetence, and laziness. Other things being equal, a longer text is, therefore, to be preferred, by the
critical editor, to a shorter text. That this principle is sound
when applied to classical literature no one who has made a
careful study of Prof. Clark's work can doubt : but it breaks down when applied to Irish texts. In Ireland, the philomath,
eager to air his stock of erudite inanity, early made his baleful appearance. To adapt the formula of Prof. Clark's analogy,
an Irish text is like a traveller who, as he passes from inn
to inn, stuffs his portmanteau with the china dogs, the waxen fruits, the crochet-work antimacassars, and all the other futilities with which his successive lodgings are adorned. It
is quite possible that when LG was drawn up by its first compiler, it was not longer than what would fill three or four sheets of notepaper. It has grown to its present dimensions
by an extraordinary accretion of glosses, interpolations, and
other amplifications. Certainly the old canon of New Testa
ment criticism, brevior lectio praeferenda verbosiori, is here
applicable ! It does not require any great insight to see that the book is in reality a combination of two originally independent documents. The block of material, sections III to VII, has been interpolated; sections II and VIII run on continuously, and were no doubt at one time in immediate connexion. If we cut the interpolated sections out, we find ourselves left

We infer that the book originally described only a single
"taking"—that of the Celtic Irish, to whom the author him
self belonged, and in whom he was chiefly interested. This is why GabCda, in the singular number, still remains in the
title of the book : it is not the "Book of Takings of Ireland," but "The Book of The Taking." The intruded matter (§§ III-VII) may have had some historical basis, but much of it partakes rather of the nature of a Theogonia : see the introductions prefixed to each of the sections, where their relation to mythology and history is
discussed. We shall see later that this group of sections is
itself capable of further analysis into separate component elements. These different histories appear to have been in existence, and (even if their combination had already been effected) to have been still available in their separate form, when Nennius wrote his Historia Britonum, about the end of the eighth
century.19 He must have been able to refer to a literary source of information about the Pre-Milesian invasions : but for the history of the Milesians themselves he apparently had

Britain, p. 5'6 : ed. Faral in La legende arthurienne (Paris, 1929), vol. iii, pp. 11, 12. For convenience I assume the historical existence
of "Nennius": after all, someone must have written the book which bears his name. Also for convenience I call him by the old-established
form of his name, rather than by the less familiar "Nemnius. "



INTRODUCTION. xxix
to depend on the oral information conveyed to him by persons described as peritissimi Scottorum (and condemned by some of his glossators with the words, nulla certa historic oriyinis Scottorum continetur). His abstract of the Pre-Milesian invasions is analysed at a later stage of our work; the only point about it which we need notice here is the single word
"Damhoctor" 20—which Nennius wrongly supposes to be a personal name, denoting the leader of one of the invading troops whose progeny was supposed to be still in Ireland at the time when Nennius wrote. But evidently it is nothing but the Irish for ' ' a company of eight persons ' '
: this misunderstood word is a valuable testimony that for this part of the history Nennius had a written text in the Irish language at his elbow.
The Relation between the Redactions.
The relationship existing between (a) the Manuscripts and (b) the Redactions has been discussed by Thurneysen21 and Van Hamel. 22 I may say that I refrained from making a close study of these most important contributions to the subject till I had formed my own conclusions, so as to arrive
at an independent opinion. The very simple stemma of the mss. drawn up by Van
Hamel (op. cit., p. 115) is hardly an adequate representation
of their inter-relationship. The facts, which are more complex, must be allowed to develop themselves as we proceed : for the moment it is sufficient to advise readers of Van Hamel's most valuable study, that the Miniugud
appendix of V (which Van Hamel calls "S") is not lost:
and that A (which Van Hamel calls "Lee I") is not a daughter MS. of his S, but, if we may further develop the
genealogical terminology, a sort of "niece." Two of the
many proofs of this have been given already. Likewise, F cannot be considered a direct copy of L; in many places it
20 We need not trouble ourselves with the variant reading Clamhoctor adopted in Petrie's edition. 21 ' ' Zur irischen Handschrif ten und Litteraturdenkmalern, zweite Serie": Abhcmidl. der k. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Gottingen, neue Folge, xiv, no. 3, 1913.

xxx [INTRODUCTION.
preserves an older and purer text. Moreover, V (Van Eamel's S) is nut an original text, but a faulty copy; in
some places even the late MSS., E and P, give preferable
readings.
As to the Redactions, both Thurneysen and Van Hainel
recognise the five different versions, R 1
, R2
, R3
, Min, and K, as they are here called. Thurneysen calls them A, B, C,
B III, and D respectively (B II being the synchronistic
matter appended to R2
). Van Hainel uses a similar
s\ mbolism—A, Ba, C, Bb, U. Their distribution of the .mss. among' the redactions is the same as mine, except that
Thurneysen counts F among the mss. of C (=R3
). This
Van Hamel corrects, and Thurneysen would probably himself ado] it the correction after another examination of the text.
But he is not without justification : for R 3 is based upon a
lost ms. of R1
, here called *Q, and F is in many respects much more closely akin to *Q than to L, the ms. adopted by all of
us as typical of R1
.
Van Hamel follows Thurneysen 's notation to avoid con
fusion; but he objects to it on account of the secondary place which it assigns to the B-group (R2
). This redaction is, in his opinion, of primary importance for the history of the text, bringing us nearer to the original form than any other.
"B" he considers to be fuller than "A"; and, although he
admits that neither is a copy of the other, he regards "A" as a mere abstract of the common original, omitting, as irrelevant, details which from the first were included in the
text, and which "B" preserves.
But on the principle laid down above (p. xxvi), in dealing
with an Irish text, the fuller it is of extraneous detail, the more likely it is to be remote from the original version.
As for .Min, appended to the three R2 mss. V, A, R, it is
obviously cognate with "A" (R1
) ; but it is equally obvious that it is neither a copy nor an abstract of "A," but an independent version. Apparently it represents a stage of the IV tradition slightly earlier than that contained in the
extant mss. of R 1
; but it certainly belongs to that group. What, then, is the relation between these versions? As I
understand it, it is as follows:
We start with a Liber Occupationis Ilibcrniae, a sort of



INTRODUCTION. xxxi
quasi-historical romance, with no backing either of history or tradition ; an artificial composition, professing to narrate the origin of the Gaeclil onward from the Creation of the World (or the Flood), their journeyings, and their settlement in
Ih < ir ' ' promised land,
' ' Ireland. This production was a slavish
copy, we might almost say a parody, of the Biblical story of the Children of Israel. The germ which suggested the idea to the writer was undoubtedly the passage in Orosius (I. 2. 81), wrongly understood as meaning that Ireland was first seen
from Brigantia in Spain, where (ibid., § 71) .there was a very lofty watch-tower. This suggested a reminiscence of Moses, overlooking the Land of Promise from Mount Pisgah : and the author set himself to work out the parallel, forward and backward. Incidentally Orosius gave trouble to Irish
topographers, ancient and modern, by speaking of an Irish river Scena, setting them on a hunt for a non-existent Inber
Scene. As sc conventionally represents the sound of sh (compare the Vulgate Judges, xii, 6, where the Hebrew word shibboleth is rendered scibboleth), we must pronounce this word as Shena, and it is then easily recognised as Orosius' version of Sinann (genitive Sinna) or "Shannon." Further, we must assume that this quasi-Israelite history was written in Latin. 23 Next we must postulate a separate text, compounded out of a number of separate sagas (or rather a number of varieties of one saga), but with a much better claim to enshrine genuine traditional (though not necessarily historical) material. This document still existed as an inde
pendent entity in the time of Nennius—or, to be more exact, Nennius had access to a manuscript, possibly of some
antiquity, which preserved it, or some of it, in its independent form. It was a brief treatise on the pre-Gaedilic inhabitants of Ireland : and as it contained the expression ddnih ochtair, "a troop of eight persons," which Nennius mistook for a proper name, it must have been written in Irish. It does not
23 A clear proof of translation from Latin is presented by some of the place-names, which have been transferred unintelligently into their Irish context in the accusative case. Thus in If 15'8, to cite but one of many examples, sech Albaniam . . . sech Ghothiam must have a Latin original behind them.



xxx ii INTRODUCTION.
appear to have contained the stories of Cessair and the other antediluvian colonists. Liber Occupationis soon began to be taken seriously: and it was inevitable thai the small tract just mentioned should become combined with it, in order to make its historical
record more complete. This changed its character, turning it into a history of Ireland, rather than a history of the people then dominant in the country. Nevertheless its title remained
unchanged: it was still Liber Occupationis. The inter
polation spoilt the logical form of the history : for its readers, having at last after many vicissitudes reached Ireland, were
now obliged to jump suddenly back to the beginning, both in time and in space, in order to follow out the second strand which had thus been interwoven with the narrative. But the earlier invasions were still of subordinate interest, and for a time were most likely differentiated by their language from the main current of the Latin story. If we could be sure
that the opening paragraphs of Min have not been drastically compressed, the scanty notice there found of the earlier invasions would very closely resemble the form of this part of the book when it had reached this stage of the development. At about the same time, the Cessair narrative (an old flood-myth mixed up with some Dindsenchas material) was committed to writing, but whether in Latin or in Irish is not very clear : presently it found a place in front of the interpolation. See further the Introduction to that section. The history of the text thereafter divided into two streams. Two schools of history, retaining its framework, each of them working independently of, and often at variance with, the other, added new material as they found it. The next stage was inaugurated by translation from Latin into Irish. The first translation to be made wTas undoubtedly from the text underlying Min. The translator headed his
work, very naturally, "An explanation of Liber Occupationis." By now the historical nature of the book was a fully accepted tradition: it was regarded as a true record of the past of Ireland and of her people: and in view of its importance ii was considered, desirable to make it accessible to students whose Latin was unequal to a study of the original
text. The associated poems, at this stage not yet incor



INTRODUCTION. xxxiii
porated with the written text, were of course in Irish from
the first.
A generation or two later, the "A" text, with the additional material which had accumulated in the interval, was translated again (R1
) ; as was also, now for the first time,
the "B" text (R2
).
This reconstruction explains all the phenomena completely :
(1) The parallel "Israel" and "Ireland" story.
(2) The short Nennius text, based on an original in Irish, enumerating the earlier invasions, but ignoring the Milesian colony. (3) The mention of a single invasion in the title, though a
large number of invasions are enumerated in the text.
(4) The general similarity of Min and R 1
, though the verbal differences forbid us to regard either as a copy of the other.
(5) The word mlniugud, "explanation" in the title of Min.
(6) The similarity of framework in R1 and R2
, though the two texts are so profoundly different that they can never have
had a common Irish original.
It may be further suggested that the Latin preface to Min, where a parallel is drawn between Ireland and Adam's Paradise, and where there are obvious reminiscences of
Orosius, is actually the preface of the original Liber Occwpationis, at least in the form to which it had evolved at the time when the translation of Min was made. It was a preface, not an intrinsic part of the text: and subsequent
translators passed it over altogether.
The next phase began when some owner of an R2 text, no
longer extant, got hold of a copy of Min. Though R2 contains
matter not in Min or R1
, the contrary is also true : and R2
is especially unsatisfactory (from the point of view of a historian who wants to know everything) in the section containing the Roll of the Kings. I do not agree that this section, in its earliest form, is an addition to the original text. I believe that a germ of this record formed an essential part of the text from the first, and that it developed with the rest. The postulated scholar sought to remedy the defects of his version by appending an abbreviated version of Min to his
copy of R2
. Where Min contained matter already in R2
, he left it out, merely writing ut supra dixi or the like : this is
enough to show that Min, as we have it, is not independent d

II3 is the pastepot - and - scissors work of a man who
anticipated the systematizing labour of O Cleirigh. Vexed at the discrepancies between the twro traditions, and having
a considerable library at his disposal, he took a text of R1
(*Q) and wrote it out with many interpolations, partly
derived from R2 (*W), partly from other sources. As we
shall see, his MS. of R 1 was imperfect; it had lost the first page, as well as the Partholon and Nemed sections.
K
is also an artificial re-handling of the text. The biblical introduction is, of set purpose, swept away, and the successive invasions are arranged in a more logical order.
This redaction is based on R2 (D), though it shows some affinities with M; but the compiler certainly used a different
copy of R3
, no longer extant, and he took arbitrary liberties with the text. There are many genealogical and other interpolations from sources outside the tradition.
It is my pleasant duty to express my acknowledgements to the Librarians and other officials of the Libraries
in which the mss. are preserved, for unfailing help and courtesy : to Professors Bergin and Eoin Mac Neill, Dr. R. I. Best, the Rev. Paul Grosjean, s.jv Dr. Myles Dillon, and Miss M. Joynt, for permitting me to consult them on various
linguistic and other questions that arose during the progress
of the work; to Professor R. W. Ditchburn, Trinity College, Dublin, for his unfailing interest and patience in the trouble
some task of photographing illegible passages ; to the lamented Provost M. R. James of Eton College, and to the Venerable Archdeacon Seymour, for valuable help in some of the questions on Apocrypha which arose in the criticism of the Biblical prolegomena in Part I ; and to the Very Rev. Canon Boylan, litt.d., for his great kindness in putting at my
service a copy of the Genesis volume of that magnificent
monument of scholarship and of typography, the Vatican edition of the Vulgate text of the Bible.



SECTION I.
From the Creation to the Dispersal of the Nations.
Introduction.
In accordance with the artificial scheme of Liber Occupationis, the history of the world from the Creation to the Tower of Babel is first recapitulated. The original form of
the text was probably something like this :
"In the beginning God made heaven and earth. He gave the
bailiffry of Heaven to Lucifer, of earth to Adam. Lucifer
sinned and was cast into Hell. He was envious of Adam, for he
was assured that Adam would take his place in Heaven. Where
upon he came and tempted Eve to sin, and Adam was driven out
of Paradise. The children of Adam sinned thereafter, in that Cain slew Abel. Seth, the third son of Adam, is the ancestor of
all the men of the world, for the Flood drowned the whole seed
of Adam except Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham, Japhet.
Shem settled in Asia, Ham in Africa, Japhet in Europe. We Gaedil are descended from Japhet."
As we read the text in its present form, and compare the
divergent versions, we realise that everything not contained in this bald summary must be a glossarial accretion. This summary was drawn up before the Vulgate text of the Old Testament had become familiar in Ireland : certainly not later than the eighth century. The Biblical quotations are from an earlier text, as is shown in detail below, in the notes appended to each paragraph. The abbreviator of Min left out the Biblical portion of that version, so that it is lost to us : but it is still possible to recover something of the history
of its evolution. We may safely presume that an early intrusion was ff 2 (in the form of a bare list of the works of Creation), fl 5 entered later; ff 6 was at first shorter than it is now ; and the genealogical matter ]\ 7-10 developed
l.g.—vol. i. B



2 SECTION I.
gradually from very small beginnings. The document upon
which two of the interpolations in fl 9 are based was early in existence, but they did not enter the text till a late stage of its formation.
Besides LF, the extant mss. of R1
, I recognise two important mss., now lost, which have had an influence on the
development of the text, These are *Q, *X. Both of these
were good copies : *X, I am inclined to think, on the whole the better of the two. *Q began with a highly ornate initial IN, which occupied a large part of the front page : and the lettering of the remainder of the page, if not of the folio, was of extra large size. Some reminiscences of this arrangement, which may be ultimately derived from *Q, appear in
VP. LB also have the large initial IN, and M has got large letters in its first column : but as will appear presently, these latter are not survivals of the *Q tradition. *Q existed in
a mutilated form down to the time of oo R3
, and it formed the chief foundation of his work.
The history of the mutilation is very interesting. It is evident that a/R2 had lost its first folio. One of the owners
of that ms., to repair the deficiency, tore out and appropriated the first folio of *Q : this made possible the paheographical
influence suggested in the preceding paragraph. By a chance, this produced continuous sense with the beginning
of the second folio of V R2
; though the sense is absurd. Only
in this way can we explain the fact that R1 and R2 are
practically identical for the first few paragraphs, and then, with startling suddenness, fly apart rather than diverge, and never again have a paragraph in common. Even the verseextracts are often set in different contexts. It also explains the further significant fact that at the point where the texts
part company, a statement is made in R2
, inconsistent with everything that follows, to the effect that the Flood was a punishment for the murder of Abel. This statement has been accidentally produced by the combination of the first half of a sentence at the bottom of the first folio of *Q with the second half of a sentence at the top of the second folio of \/R2
.
The continuous use of *Q by oo R3 begins immediately after this mutilation, proving that *Q was actually the copy



INTRODUCTION. 3
which he used. We shall see presently that oo R3
, in his
turn, repaired the damage to *Q by tearing out the openingfolios of a translation of the Book of Genesis, and substituting
it for the missing matter. When this act of pillage was performed, or subsequently, one of the Genesis folios was torn across : and this accident has made it possible, as is
shown in the proper place, to arrive at some approximation to an idea of the size of the folios of *Q, and the amount of literary matter that would go upon each. Now, the first of these folios must have contained the matter at the beginning,
common to the two redactions R1 R2 (in the present form of the latter) : and it is insufficient to fill one of the ordinary
folios of *Q. We infer, therefore, that much space must have been expended upon a large initial, and in letters of an extra
large size upon the opening page. The importation of "Iofer Niger" into fl 4, derived from the Latin Life of St. Juliana, gives us another chronological hint. If the Old Latin Biblical excerpts suggest an eighthcentury date at latest for the compilation, the name of the
demon suggests a ninth-century date for the beginning of glossation, the date of the Juliana text being about 800 a.d.
As Iofer Niger exists in L (corrupted), *Q (first folio, trans
ferred to R2
) and *X, a ms. which underlies some glossarial matter in R2
, he must have been found in yLF *X *Q. This
manuscript, therefore, contained the full text as we have it, except for such interpolations as were afterwards incor
porated. (Though it will afterwards appear that *Q probably
lacked the Partholon and Nemed sections.) F knows nothing
of Iofer Niger; he must, therefore, have been still glossarial
in yF and passed over by s F.
The history of the gloss in ff 1, of the Iofer Niger inter
polation in fl 4, and of the interpolation |f 5, as summarized in the notes on these passages, is all self-consistent. It
shows that three stems branched off from yLF *X *Q, be
coming respectively the parents of L, *X, and F *Q, The
F* Q tradition is slightly the oldest of the three, but the *X tradition is nearly as old, and in some cases preserves better
readings; it is a pity that we have so little of this ms. F is
a curious text, a mixture of L and *Q ; but though very
closely cognate with *Q, it has too much in common with L



1 SECTION I.
to be divorced from it altogether. Though actually a later ms. than L, it preserves an older stage of the tradition, and
has not travelled so far from it as L has done. After the extant portion of the original form of R2 begins, the two redactions have nothing in common. This can be
shown by a summary in parallel columns :
R
1 .
TT 1. Genesis I 1. 2. List of "Works of Creation. 3. Lucifer and Adam : revolt
of Angels. 4. Envy of Lucifer. The Fall. 5. Sentence on Adam. 6. Cain and Abel.

19. A poem on the foregoing
history.
It must surely be evident that the brief mention of the
Flood in R1 is original, while the long and laboured paraphrase
of the Biblical story in R2 is imported. The details of the genealogies are taken from different and mutually contra
dictory sources. Without doubt, the lost beginning of R2
differed in a like degree from the first six paragraphs of R1 which were substituted for it : we can have no direct knowledge of what it may have contained, but we may be
absolutely certain that it emphasized the divine command on the Sethites to abstain from intermarriage with the Cainites, and that this command, and the disobedience of it
by the Sethites, came after the R2 narrative of the death of
Abel, and was the original antecedent to the Flood narrativenot improbably as we have it in fl 53, which may come, either
from Sex Aetates Mundi, or from R2 through *Z.



INTRODUCTION. 5
The redaction R3 is not, like R1 and R2
, an independent work. It is essentially a composite, based on the two pre
ceding redactions. The foundation of it is R1
, but it is
swelled with large interpolations from R2 and from other sources.
The manuscript of R1 used by co R3 was unquestionably
*Q, after it had suffered the loss of its first leaf. For the
text of R1 as it appears in R3 begins, as we have said above, immediately after the lacuna thus caused. To supply the
deficiency, oo R3 tore the opening leaves out of an Irish trans
lation of the Book of Genesis, 1 thereby killing the translation, of which no other copy survives, and which would have been of enormous linguistic value. This, with its extensive inter
polated glosses, occupies Iffl 20-85. The relation between
the remainder of R3
, § I, and the previous redactions is set
forth in the following table :

6 SECTION I.
The Biblical Excerpt.
Reviewing the Biblical excerpt, and its relation to the text
as a whole, we naturally ask first if it was prepared ad hoc
by the compiler of R3
, or borrowed by him from some trans
lation previously in existence. To this question there can be
but one reasonable answer. Much of the matter in the
Biblical chapters was altogether irrelevant to the purpose
of oo R3
: a short abstract, such as is given by R\ would have
served him as well, or better. The translator expended much trouble over his work ; the evidence that he collated the Greek Septuagint with the Vulgate text cannot be set aside; to do this merely as a preface to a historical tract relating to Ireland would involve a heavy expenditure of time, trouble, and valuable parchment. Collation of texts in the Middle
Ages, without the easily read printed page, and without
alphabetical indexes and other apparatus, would have been a much more formidable task than it is to-day. Certainly
the scribes who have transmitted R3 appear to have found much of this preliminary matter wearisome and out of place, as is shown by the reduction of the frequent repetitions of
the original (as, for example, I 25, and the list of creatures preserved in the Ark). Another point is the difference in
literary style that we feel between the Biblical excerpt and its present context. The translator has certain peculiar mannerisms, to which attention is drawn in the critical notes,
and which give him an individuality. On the other hand, it would be so easy to tear from another MS. the pages required, that we are obliged to accuse
co R3 of having committed this crime, to save himself the trouble of otherwise replacing the missing first page of the exemplar before him.
Some examination of the nature of the text wThich formed the basis of the translator's work now becomes necessary. For purposes of reference we shall denote the Latin ms. which lay before the translator by the symbol A. (New Testament critics have appropriated this symbol to the ninthcentury Greco-Latin Codex Sangallensis ; but as we shall here have no occasion to refer to that ms., there will be no con
sequent inconvenience.) A was certainly a copy of the Vulgate ; from the translation it is possible to restore some of its readings with sufficient assurance to determine its



INTRODUCTION. 7
affinities. The chief passages in which A deviated from the Standard Text, as constructed in the Vatican Variorum edition, are enumerated below, with a list of the mss. (not including early printed texts and editions) agreeing with it: I 2. erant: GGA HXncD2(, BA<I>v*©AM**BDF2 SM T 2. Domini: AH B

In the above and the following tables, an asterisk denotes a reading abolished by a corrector : these must be reckoned,

for they presumably belonged to the original tradition of the family to which the ms. belonged. Readings denoted
by 0), (
2
) are corrections prima maim and secunda maim. Though they are noted here, they are not taken into account
in classifying the mss. for our present purpose. Some of the
above readings may possibly be due to LXX influence. Dis
regarding, however, this possibility for the moment, we now arrange the Vulgate mss. in the order of their frequency in
the foregoing table, as follows :
2° 15+ 1*



INTRODUCTION. 9
This may be a rough-and-ready method of reckoning, but
it gives us a definite and apparently satisfactory result. We
may leave the O group out of account; it consists of three
mss. of French origin, now at Paris, and of the 13-14 century : later, therefore, than any probable date for A.
The * group is Italian, entirely 12th century—again rather late to have served as the model for the Irish text. The % and A groups are both Spanish : and we infer that A
was also a ms. of Spanish origin. But the translator did not adhere slavishly to the Latin text before him. He had access to, and could use, a copy of the Septuagint; and the influence of this is shown by the
following readings :
I 11. Insert 6 6*6%

Some of these, taken by themselves, are not very impressive : but their evidence is cumulative, and the reading
in VII 3 is conclusive. The figures in chapter V are less so, for they could have come from Isidore (Etym. V. 39) : but the unequivocal cases of reference to the Septuagint strengthen the probability of the use of this authority, even where an alternative source is possible.



10 SECTION I.
It i$ at least a coincidence that this combination of a
knowledge of Greek, with some Spanish connexion, meets us again, in the North of Ireland. In the cemetery which contains the few remaining relics of the Monastery of
St. Mura at Fahan, Co. Donegal, there is a large slab, bearing beautifully-designed interlacing crosses on each face. On one side there is a pair of human figures, standing with the cross-stem between them, and bearing upon their vesture an Irish inscription which does not here concern us. On the
edge there is an inscription in Greek uncials
AOHA KAI TIME (sic) IIATPI KAI YIO KAI IINEYMATI AITO
" Glory and Honour to Father and to Son and to Holy Spirit."
This is the first versicle of the "Gloria Patri, " in a
Spanish form, though in the Greek language. The formula "Glory and Honour," without the second versicle (sicut erat, etc.), was sanctioned by the Council of Toledo, and adopted in the Mozarabic liturgy. Thus we find someone who was at
least a superficial Greek scholar, cutting, on an Irish tomb
stone, a Spanish liturgical formula, in letters resembling those of a Greek uncial ms. : and someone else translating into Irish a Biblical text from a Spanish copy, and able to
check his work with a copy of the Septuagint. We have no authority to go further, or to suppose that the translation was actually executed in Fahan. This is not impossible, though the translation could hardly be as old as the slab.
But in any case the number of uncial mss. of the Septuagint available in Ireland can never have been very large.
It is for us a fortunate circumstance that the matter of Genesis XI 10-32 is misplaced in our text, being inserted between the verses VIII 19 and 20. There is no logical reason for this : the cause must have been mechanical, and due to the misplacement of a loose folio. It follows that the matter wrhich now comes after these verses was contained in a folio which ran from VIII 20 to
XI 9. As we do not possess the translation in its original
form—there are both omissions and interpolations—a count of words would lead us to wrong conclusions about the size of the folios, or the extent of the matter upon each. But a



INTRODUCTION. 11
count of the corresponding words in the Vulgate text will enable us to estimate this with tolerable accuracy. If I have counted aright,
A. Genesis VIII 20-IX 27 in the Vulgate text contains 503 words.
B. „ IX 28-X 31 „ „ „ „ „ 382 „
C. „ X 32-XI 9 „ „ „ „ „ 170 „
B
is missing from the translation as we have it, but it must have been there originally. Its omission would leave C, the Tower of Babel story, as a small detached narrative, too short for a folio of any reasonable size. It is easy to believe
that the LG copyists, who pared away the redundancies of the Flood story, would have "jibbed" at the task of
transcribing the tiresome list of incomprehensible names in the "Table of Nations" (Genesis X), which has nothing to do with the Taking of Ireland, and would use up much costly parchment.
ABC together amount to 1,055 words. If the translation of this passage was written upon one folio of vellum, with two columns on each page, there would be the equivalent of about 26-1 words in each column : or what would fill about 35 out of the 55-60 lines in a column of the Book of
Ballymote. I have not counted words back to the beginning of Genesis.
But taking a printed edition, not complicated with interspersed references, and omitting the chapter headings, I find that
Genesis I 1-VIII 19 covers 70| inches of type.
Genesis VIII 20-XI 9 „ 22£ „ „ „
The number of words in this printed copy is not evenly distributed : one column in Chapter III, in which the verses
are long, contains 252 words, and another, in Chapter V, of exactly the same spacial length, contains 232 words. There
is thus a sufficient margin of possible adjustment to permit us to say that the material preceding VIII 19 could have been written on three folios similar to that which we have
postulated for VIII 20-XI 9. We infer from this that the
matter appropriated by oo R3 covered a complete gathering of four folios, or two diplomas (pairs of conjugate folios), and



12 SECTION I.
the detached first folio of the next gathering. When a man carries off such a gathering and one extra folio, nothing is more natural for him to do than to slip the loose leaf into
the gathering, to prevent it from being lost : and if its proper place is just after the last folio of the gathering, he will slip
it in just before that folio. And this is exactly what he has done, to the confusion of his copyists. Numbering the five folios of this Biblical MS. 1, 2, 3, 5, 4,
in the order in which they ultimately became incorporated
in R f
, we see that 4 must have ended with the words3 Hae
sunt generationes Sem (XI 10), which, however, were dropped by the copyists, as they had no meaning in their new context.
5 a began Sem erat centum annorum (ff 69) and ran on to ueneruntque usque Haran et habitauerunt ibi (XI 31). This is a little longer than the allowance of 264 words to the column ; but the matter of these verses contains many
numerals and stereotyped repetitions, which could be much abbreviated : and in any case column (3 must have begun with (XI 32), Et facti sunt dies Thare. For we must now notice the further fact, that the lower part of folio 5 was torn away (whether in the original act of theft or by some later accident
cannot be ascertained, and is of trifling importance). This tear ran upwards obliquely, from the bottom inner edge to the top outer edge. It carried away from the first column (5 a)
parts of all the verses after XI 26, and it left nothing intact
in the second column except this one verse, XI 32. The copyists could not, or at least made no attempt to, extract any sense from the remaining fragments of the mutilated lines; and thus it comes about that the misplaced extract from Chapter XI, in fl 77, jumps from v. 26 to v. 32, and then stops abruptly. The verso of the folio must have contained, in the first column, a few lines of the story of Abraham hiding his relationship to Sarah in Egypt, and in the vsecond column the end of the story of Lot in Sodom and the beginning of the Battle of the Four Kings with the Five. These fragments were so utterly disconnected with the matter in hand, and with each other, that the copyists left them out.
3 Meaning, of course, the Irish translation of these words ; and similarly for the other quotations in this paragraph.



INTRODUCTION. 13
This reconstruction of the original form of the Biblical translation is more than a mere curiosity; for as it was possible to attach the Biblical folios to *Q, we may infer that
the sizes of the two manuscripts were much about the same.
And every scrap of information that we can discover about
*Q is of importance, for the history of R3
.
The Chasm in B, M.
B has lost, as already stated, its folio 9, beginning after the words ocus ro hoslaicit (Gen. Ill 7, ]\ 32), and extending to U 138 in § II. This mutilation took place after 8 and
V/? 1
/?
2 were copied; and a count of words shows that the matter with which they fill this gap would exactly cover a leaf of B. Therefore one folio has been lost, and no more, at this place; a conclusion which accords with the old
pagination.
The fragment H almost exactly fills the gap. If the top of the first leaf of this fragment had not been torn away, it would have filled it with suspicious exactness. Suspicious,
because it suggests the deduction that the leaves of H were
actually torn, from the MS. to which they belonged, by an owner of B, anxious to make his own property complete. They certainly present the appearance of having been pulled out violently. 4
But the matter in H is considerably longer than what would fill a folio of B, and it contains an extensive passage
ignored by the derivatives of B. We infer that there was a lacuna in yB, due to the loss of leaves in an ancestral ms.,
of which s B was unconscious.
When we look up M at this place we find a similar lacuna.
It is less extensive ; there is some matter common to M and IT
but unknown to B. Unlike s B, s M was aware of the defect in his exemplar, and he left a half column blank in the hope,
4 It is likely that copies of this lengthy and important text were few,
and were much in demand : and that Irish book-collectors were not any more conscientious than the rest of the fraternity. The total
disappearance of the copy in Lebor na Huidri (ante, p. xxi) was. probably the result of someone having been left for a few moments, alone with that precious codex.



14 SECTION I.
never to be fulfilled, of finding a more perfect copy from which to supply the missing matter.
We may represent the relative lengths of the missing portion in tabular form thus: let a represent the quantity of matter surviving in M, between the beginning of the lacuna
in B and the beginning of the lacuna in M. Then we have
i. A length of a, absent in B, present in M, present in H.
ii. A length of 5a, absent in B, absent in M, present in H.
iii. A length of 2a, absent in B, present in M, present in H.
The third of these sections is the poem Athair catch, and a few lines intervening between it and the resumption of B.
The explanation is perfectly simple. B, M, H all derive
from mss. copied independently from an ancestor, yBMH.
There can, therefore, be no common ancestor of any two of these mss. excluding the third : this is an assured fact of
fundamental importance in the criticism of the mss. of R3
.
The first of the ancestral mss. to be copied was oo H, the second oo M, the third oo B. Between the transcribing of the first and last of these a gathering of four diplomas dis
appeared from yBMH piecemeal. Each folio of yBMH
contained matter equal in quantity to a. Here is a diagram
of the gathering
r~
The whole gathering was intact when oo H was copied. Then the diplomas 4-5, 3-6, as well as folio 2 disappeared ;
after which oo M was copied. Folio 7 was now loose : it contained the beginning of Athair cdich, which must have begun at the top of folio 7 recto and ended near the end of folio 8 verso. There are 57 quatrains in this poem, so that
the folios of yBMH must have been quite small : each page



INTRODUCTION. 15
could not have held more than 15 quatrains. Folio 7, as well
as the last diploma 1-8, disappeared before oo B was copied. The impression which a study of the language of the translation leaves is that the latter is not much earlier than
R
3
, with which it is incorporated. Like the O'Clerys and the Four Masters, the translator affects an archaistic style, which he presumably thought was more consistent with the dignity of the text on which he was working. His language, when he is natural, is Middle Irish ; his archaisms are Wardour-street revivals rather than survivals.- He uses a deponent form for the verb whenever he remembers to do so. He invents forms like bar?iimdaigther, fl 24, which he has forgotten in fl 25, where we find "dentar bar n-imdugad." It
is more than probable that the MS. which oo R3 mutilated was actually the autograph of the translation, and that this was, as we have said, killed by the transaction. It is clear that the glossators had no idea that they were dealing with a Scriptural text. One of them had to reassure himself that the reference to the Holy Spirit in fl 20 is not profane: and another (fl 30 y 2
) quotes "Holy Scripture" to corroborate the passage from Holy Scripture upon which he is working !

THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 17
First Reduction
1. In principio fecit Deus caelum et terram, i.e.,
God made Heaven and Earth at the first, [and He
Himself hath no beginning nor ending].
2. He made first the formless mass, and the light
of angels, [on the first Sunday]. He made Firmament
[on the Monday]. He made earth and seas [on the
Tuesday]. He made sun and moon and the stars of
Heaven [on the Wednesday]. He made birds [of the
air] and reptiles [of the sea on the Thursday]. He
made beasts [of the earth] in general, and Adam to rule over them, [on the Friday]. Thereafter God rested [on the Saturday] from the accomplishment of
a new Creation, [but by no means from its governance] .
3. [Thereafter] He gave the bailiffry of Heaven to Lucifer, with the nine orders of the Angels of Heaven.
He gave the bailiffry of Earth to Adam [and to Eve,
with her progeny]. [Thereafter] Lucifer sinned, so that he was leader of a third of the host of angels. The King confined him with a third of the host of

angels in his company, in Hell. And God said unto
the Folk of Heaven : [Haughty is this Lucifer], uenite ut confundamus consilium eius.
4. Thereafter Lucifer had envy against Adam, for
he was assured that this would be given him (Adam),
the filling of Heaven in his (Lucifer's) room. Wherefore he [Iofer Niger] came in the form of the serpent,
and persuaded [Adam and] Eve to sin, in the matter of eating of the apple from the forbidden tree.
Wherefore Adam was expelled from Paradise into
common earth.
5. Thereafter the Lord came to them, and He said unto Adam, Terra es et in terram ibis [i.e., of earth was he made and into earth shall he go]. In sudore uultus tui comedes panem, tuum [i.e., he shall not obtain satisfaction
without labour]. He said further unto the woman: Cum dolore et gemitu paries filios tuos et filias tuas [i.e., it shall be with . . . insufferable pain that thou shalt bring forth
thy sons].
6. The progeny of Adam
sinned [thereafter] , namely, the elder of the sons of Adam, Cain the accursed,
who slew his brother Abel
. . . (through his jealousy?) and through his greed, with the bone of a camel, as learned men say. (In this manner ?) began the kin-murders of the world.
But thereafter the pro
geny of Adam wrought treachery, by way of pride,
of haughtiness, of sin, of
kin-murder—Cain son of Adam, the elder, he slew his brother Abel through
his greed and his jealousy, with the shaft of a camelbone. [And therefore God brought a Flood over the
whole earth] .

7. As for Seth, one of the three sons of Adam
[who had progeny], of him are the men of the whole world :
Noe s. Lamech s. Mathusalem s. Enoch s. Iared s. Malalahel s. Cainan s. Enos s. Seth s. Adam.
For it is Noe who is the second Adam, to whom the
men of all the world are traced. For the Flood drowned the whole seed of Adam, except Noe with his three sons, Sem, Ham, Iafeth, and their four wives
Coba, Olla, Oliva, Olivana.
Afterwards, when God brought a Flood over the whole world, none of the people of the world escaped from the
Flood except it be the people of that ark—Noe with his three sons, and the wife of Noe, and the wives of his sons.

8. Now Sem settled in Asia, Ham in Africa, Iafeth
in Europe
Poem no. II.
Sem had thirty sons, including Arfaxad, Assur, and

Or it is twenty-seven sons that Sem had.

9. [With regard to] Iai'eth [son of Noe], of him
is the northern side of Asia—namely Asia Minor,
Armenia, Media, the People of Scythia; and of him are the inhabitants of all Europe.
Grecus s. Iafeth, of him. is Grecia Magna, Grecia Parva, and Alexandrian Greece. Espanus s. Iafeth from
whom are the Hispani. Gomer son of Iafeth had two sons, Emoth and Ibath. Emoth, of him is the northern people
of the world. Ibath had two sons, Bodb and Baath. Bodb, who had a son Dohe.
Elinus son of Dohe had three sons, Airmen, Negna, Isacon. As for Airmen, he had five sons, Gutus, Cebidus, Uiligothus, Burgundus, Longbardus. Negua had three sons, Saxus, Boarus, Uandalus. Isacon, moreover, one of the three sons of Elenus, he had four sons, Romanus, Francus, Britus, Albanus.
This is that Albanus who first took Albania, with his children, and of him is Alba named : so he drove his brother across the Sea of Icht, and from him are the Albanians of Latium of Italy.
10. Magog son of Iafeth, of his progeny are the
peoples who came to Ireland before the Gaedil : to wit
Partholon s. Sera s. Sru s. Esru s. Bimbend (sic) s.
Aithech s. Magog s. Iafeth; and Nemed s. Agnomain
s. Pamp s. Tat s. Sera s. Sru; and the progeny of
Nemed, the Gaileoin, Fir Domnann, Fir Bolg, and

1*. In principio fecit Deus caelum et terram, i.e.,
God made Heaven and Earth at the first.
2*. He made first the formless mass, and the light
of Angels, [on the first Sunday]. He made Firmament
[on the Monday]. He made earth and sea [on the
Tuesday]. He made sun and moon and the stars of
Heaven [on the Wednesday]. He made birds [of the
air] and [marine] reptiles [on the Thursday].
He made beasts [of the earth] in general, and Adam to rule over them[, on the Friday]. Thereafter [God]
rested [on the Saturday] from the accomplishment of His new creation [, and gave them a blessing, but by no means from its governance].
2 a. In this wise God made the creatures : some with beginning and without end, as Angels ; some moreover with beginning and with end, as irrational beasts and fruits of the earth; some further with beginning and with termina
tion and without termination, as are men—a beginning to their bodily birth and a termination to their bodies, and no termination to their souls.

In this wise, further, was that man, Adam, made : his body of common earth, his head of the land of Garad, his breast of the land of Arabia, his belly of Lodain, his legs of the land of Agoria : his blood [and his sweat] of the water of the air, his breath of the air, his heat of fire, his soul of the breath of God. In the third hour after the creation of Adam, Eve was drawn out of his side. At the age of a thirty years' space Adam was created, at the age of twelve years Eve was created. 3*. [God] gave the bailiffry of Heaven to Lucifer, with
nine orders of Angels about him. [Thereafter] He gave
the bailiffry of Earth to Adam [and to Eve with his progeny]. Lucifer made an assault upon Heaven, by reason of pride and haughtiness against God, so that he was expelled, for the crime of that haughtiness, out from Heaven, [with a third of the host of anjgels in his com
pany], into Hell. So that then God said unto the Folk of Heaven: [Over-haughty is this Lucifer]: et dixit, Venite lit uideamus et confundamus consilium eius, i.e., Come and let us see and put to shame the counsel of this Lucifer. That is the first judgement which was ever pronounced. 4*. Thereafter Lucifer had envy against Adam,
(for) he was assured that this would be given him [as a reward], to fill Heaven in his room. Wherefore he [Iofer Niger] came in the form of a serpent [with a
tenuous body] and persuaded Eve to the sin, in the
matter of eating of the apple from the forbidden tree,
[and Eve persuaded Adam] . . .

Et dixit, In sudore uidtus tui comedes panem tuum, [i.e.. It shall be in the sweat of thy face that thou shalt eat thy
loaves]. He said further unto Eve, Cum dolore et gemitu
paries filios tuos [et filias tuas, i.e., It shall be with torment and sickness that thou shalt bring forth thy sons and
thy daughters]. 5a. The corporeal creation was displayed to Adam, and he
accepted them not. Wherefore a sleep was cast upon him. In
that sleep thereafter was Eve fashioned, after being drawn from
the seventh rib out of his side. And then said Adam : Ecce os de ossibus meis, et oaro de came mea [i.e. (.b) it is as it were that (?) I see a bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. That is
the first laugh which was ever uttered, and the first welcome].
4*. ... After incurring the guilt of the trans
gression, Adam was then expelled out of Paradise
into the common earth, [lest he should eat the fruits of the Tree of Life in Paradise; for were he to eat, he would never die, but have health and ease of mind( c) (!)].
6*. Thereafter the progeny of Adam committed transgression, to wit, the elder of the sons of Adam, Cain the accursed, by the slaying of his brother Abel
son of Adam in his envy and haughtiness. [That was the first kin-murder of the world]. With the cheek

bone of a camel Cain slew his brother. [Or, as others say, after the likeness of the slaying of the sacrifices, it was his grasp which he closed around his neck] . . .
11. . . . so that it was on that account that God brought a Flood over the world altogether, so that
none thereof escaped alive except Noe and his wife,
[his own sister], and his three sons, [who were the husbands of his three daughters], and his three daughters, [who were the wives of the three sons].
12. Now this was the reason for their deliverance to the exclusion of all others, for that they mingled no friendship with the progeny of Cain; and for their
replenishing of the earth again. Forty days was the
Flood a-raining. Six hundred years was the age of Noe when he went into his ark, [when there came to Noe the construction and ordering of the ark in
accordance with the teaching of God : pairs of the
unclean, triple pairs (or sevens) of the clean, for the
purpose of sacrifice after the Flood]. So Noe went
with his sons [and with his daughters] and with their
wives, into his ark, on the seventeenth day of the moon of May. [On the nones of May they went into the Ark.] Twelve cubits [was the water] above the highest mountains.

THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 33
Ten cubits was the ark under water, and twenty above
water : and this is why it was ten under water—the Flood had twelve above the highest mountain, for the sake of the ark, for it (the ark) had ten cubits under water. So that two cubits of water would not be excessive between the keel of the ark and the tops of the mountains. Therefore the waters were twelve cubits in depth above every lofty mountain.
13. The Flood drowned all the men and beasts
together, except the people of the ark, [and Enoch,
who is in Paradise to fight against Antichrist, and
Fintan son of Bochra. He it is who should relate these stories to all men, after the Flood].
14. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the
waters began to dry up. Twenty-seven days and seven months was the ark (moving) from wave to wave, till it settled on a mountain of Armenia. The
waters dried up until the < tenth month : on the first
day of the> tenth month the tops of the mountains
were seen. At the end of forty-seven days thereafter,
Noe opened a window of the ark, and he sent the
raven forth ; and it came not back again. He let the
dove out on the morrow, and it came back, for it found no place where it should stay. Noah sent it forth

in its beak. And he sent it forth again at the end of seven days, and it came not back.
15. God said unto Noe to come out of the Ark, on
the twenty-seventh day of the moon of May, [on the day before the nones of May,] in the six hundred and
first year of the age of Noe.
The beginning of the second age of the world. To the birth of Abram it reached, two hundred ninety and two
years according to the Hebrew verity, but according to the Septuagint it is eight hundred forty and two years.
Thereafter Noe caused an altar to be builded to God [, the first altar that was made after the Flood] . Three hundred and fifty years was Noe alive after the Flood : and Noe divided the world into three parts among his sons.
The names of the sons of Noe : Sem, Ham, Iafeth. The names of their wives thereafter : Olla, Olivana, Oliva(°0 : de quibus dicitur hoc carmen:

Iafeth is the north side of Asia, and the people of all
Europe : and of his progeny are we who are Gaedil.

Scot, from whom are the Scots. Now it is Rifath Scot who brought the Scotic Language from the Tower, for he was one of the six principal chieftains
who were at the building of the Tower of Nemrod.
From that, it is clear that Feinius was not at the building of the Tower, as the historians say who have not harmonized the synchronism. This is why we say so, for
Feinius was the sixteenth in descent from Rifath, who brought Scotic from the Tower.

Eight hundred seventy and four years from the
beginning of the princedom of Ninus to the end of
the princedom of Tutanes, king of the world. Toward
his time was Troy taken for the last time. There
were seven years after that capture, till Aeneas [son of Anchises] took [Lavinia] daughter of Latinus s.

From that it is clear that the authors of the Auraicept do not reach a correct conclusion, that Latinus was one of the six chief leaders of the Tower, seeing that the length downward between them is forty years, from the dispersal of the Tower till Feinius Farsaid came from the north, out of Scythia with his School, to seek for the languages : for they thought that they would find them there («) inasmuch
as it was from thence that they were dispersed. There were two years after the coming of Feinius from the north until Ninus.
18. It is the aforesaid Nel son of Feinius Farsaid whom Pharao Cincris King of Egypt invited, for the
greatness of his skill, his knowledge, and his learning :
and Pharao granted him an estate, and his daughter, Scota her name, was bestowed.
Some say that the reason why she was called "Scota"
was that "Scot" was her husband's name, and "Scots" the name of the people from whom he came ; unde dicilur "Scotus" and "Scota."

i.e., God created Heaven and Earth at the first.
And He hath no beginning Himself, nor ending.
In this wise God made the creatures : some of them with beginning and without end, as Angels; some of them with beginning and with termination, as irrational beasts and fruits of the earth; some of them moreover with beginning and with termination and without termination, as
are men—a beginning to their bodily birth and a termination to their bodies, and without termination to their souls.
On the Sunday God made the immense formless mass, [the materials of the corporeal creatures, fire and air, earth and water, upon the fifteenth of the kalends of April according to Hebrews and Latins, although no sun

was set upon its course as yetj ; it is then that God made
a beginning of fashioning the creatures. On the Monday, [on the fourteenth of the kalends of April,] God made Heaven. On the Tuesday, [on the thirteenth of the kalends of April,] God made the earth, and brought Sea around it. On the Wednesday, [on the twelfth of the kalends of April,] God made sun and moon and stars and heavenly bodies. On the Thursday, [on the eleventh of the kalends of April] God made the marine beasts and the birds of the air. On the Friday, moreover, [on the
tenth of the kalends of April,] God made Adam and all the terrestrial beasts. Moreover God ceased on the Saturday, [the ninth of the kalends of April,] from the work of a new creation.
(2) Now, after the creation of Heaven and Earth, thus
was the earth; fallow without fruit, bare and empty
without indweller. And thick darknesses were at
that time over the face of the abyss
the common material of the creatures
And the Spirit of the Lord was borne over the waters.
No wickedness is spoken here of the Holy Spirit, but excellence and honour of Him, 'beyond the creatures.
(3) and God [the Heavenly Father] said: Let the
light be made. And the light was made. (4) God
separated and divided the light from the darknesses.
(5) And He gave the name 'Day' to the light, and
the name 'Night' to the darknesses. And thus were
made evening and morning, the first day.

21. (6) Further He said : Let the firmament be made in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the
waters from the waters. (7) And God made the firmament, and divided the waters that were beneath
Firmament from the waters that were above
Firmament : and thus was it done. (8) And God gave the name of 'Heaven' to Firmament, and evening and morning were made, the second day.
22. (9) Moreover God said : Let the waters that
are under Heaven be collected into one place, and let
the Dry appear : and so was it done. (10) And this
is the name which God gave to the Dry, 'Earth': and God called the assemblages of the waters, 'Seas/
And God saw that it was good. (11) And God said : Let the earth bring forth green grass, and grass that shall make seed; and let it bring forth the fruit
bearing tree that shall make fruit according to itskind, and that shall have its seed within itself upon
earth. (12) And the earth put forth green grass, and
grass that maketh ,seed according to its kind, and it
put forth the tree that maketh fruit, and that hath
every seed according to its species. And God saw
that to be good. (13) And evening and morning were made, the third day.
23. (14) Moreover God said : Let brightly shining
lights be made in the firmament of Heaven, and let
them divide Day and Night : and let them be for signs
and for times, for days and for years, (15) that they

(16) And God made two bright and great lights : He
made the greater light [the sun] that it might rule over
the day, and the lesser light in the night [the moon].
And He made stars, (17) and set them in the firmament

(21) And God created great [sea] -monsters, and every living and mobile beast which the waters brought
forth in their species. And God created all the birds
according to their kind, and God saw that to be good.
(22) And God blessed them, and said : Increase and be ye multiplied, and fill the water of the sea, and let
the birds be multiplied upon the land. (23) And thus were morning and evening made, the fifth day.

the earth after their fitting species; and so was it
done. (25) [This verse missing.] (26) And God
said : Let us make the Man under our own image and likeness, and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the birds of Heaven, and over
the beasts of the whole earth. (27) And God created
the Man under His own image
Now in this wise did God make the Man : his body of earth [his head of the land of Garad, his breast and bosom of the land of Arabia, his belly of Lodain, his legs of the land of Agoiria], his blood of [the] water [of the air], his breath of air, his heat of fire, his soul of the breath of God. Thus it is that the four elements are in every man.
In truth He made man and woman under the image
of God. He created them (28) and blessed them and
said : Increase, and let your multiplication be accomplished, and fill the earth, and subdue it unto yourselves, and lord it over the fishes of the sea and the birds of the Heaven and all the beasts upon the
earth. (29) And God said : See, I have given you all the grass that bringeth forth seed upon the earth, and all the trees that have the seed of their proper kind within themselves, that they may be for food and sustenance unto you : (30) and unto all the beasts of the earth, and unto all the birds of Heaven, and unto all that have motion upon the earth, and that have
within them the soul that quickeneth, that they may
have them for nourishment. And thus was it done. (31) And God saw all things that He had made [and that were], that they were wondrous good: and evening and morning were made, the sixth day.

Factumque est 10<ita> uespere et mane, dies "primus.
21. (6) Dixit quoque ^Deus] : Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum, et diuidat aquas ab aquis. (7) Et fecit Deus firmamentum, diuisitque aquas quae erant sub 2firmamento 3 ab aquis quae erant super firmamentum : et factum est ita. (8) Vocauitque Deus firmamentum 'Caelum,' et factum est uespere et mane, dies secundus.
22. (9) Dixit uero Deus: Congregentur aquae quae sub caelo sunt in locum unum, et appareat aricla : factumque est
ita. (10) Et uocauit Deus aridam, Terram; congregationesque aquarum appellauit Maria. Et uidit Deus quod esset bonum. (11) Et ait 1<Deus> : Germinet terra herbam uirentem et 2 facientem semen, et lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta
3 genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram. 4 [Et factum est ita]. (12) Et protulit terra herbam uirentem
et 5facientem semen iuxta genus suum, lignumque faciens fructum et habens unumquodque sementem secundum speciem suam. Et uidit Deus quod esset bonum. (13) Factumque est uespere et mane, dies tertius.
23. (14) Dixit autem Deus: Fiant Huminaria in firmamento caeli, 2 et dividant diem ac noctem, et sint in signa,
et tempora, 3 [et] dies, et annos, (15) ut luceant in firmamento caeli, et inluminent terram. Et factum est ita. (16) Fecitque Deus duo magna luminaria : luminare maius ut praeesset diei, et luminare minus 4 [ut praeesset] nocti : et 5 <fecit> Stellas, (17) et posuit eas in firmamento caeli, ut lueerent
super terram, (18) et praeessent diei ac nocti, et diuiderent

Notes on the Biblical Text, Chapter I.
The following abbreviations are used in these notes:
Heb. —The original Hebrew text.
LXX.—The Greek rendering, commonly called the Septuagint.
OL. —The Old Latin version or versions. Vulg.—The Vulgate.



52 SECTION I.—FROM THE CREATION TO
ST—The Standard text, as set forth in the Vatican variorum edition of the Vulgate. (For the apparatus criticus of the Latin
text, reference must be made to this comprehensive work.)
A—The MS. of the Vulgate used by the Irish translator.
Tr.—The Irish translator, or his translation.

, sR3—The Third Redaction of LG; a Scribe of the Third Redaction.
fl 20. 1 creauit, not fecit, as in R1 R 2
, showing at the outset that we have now to deal with a Vulgate text. 2 The bracketed
words are paraphrased only in the text of Tr. : possibly by sR 3
, who inserted some of the long interpolation just preceding, in order to complete its incorporation with the text. It may be worth noting, as a coincidence, that the sense of the paraphrase resembles the possible alternative reading of
the well-known syntactic ambiguity at the beginning of Heb. (on which see any standard commentary, such as Driver's or Skinner's). These opening words can be, and probably ought to be, translated "In the beginning of God's creating . . . the earth was without form ..." To this version the sense of the Irish text approximates. 3 The plural dorchata, corresponding to the Latin tenebrae, is an illustration of
Tr.'s almost slavish literalness. On the other hand, he never
hesitates to strengthen his rendering by inserting synonyms or adjectives (as here dluithi). ^Erant, rejected in ST, but contained in many mss. Nobidis shows that it was found
in A. In tan sin corresponds to nothing in any ms., and is
presumably an incorporated gloss. 5Dei in ST, Domini in two mss. only. 6 Either Tr. or sR3 has committed hap
lography. Possibly Tr.'s eye wandered unconsciously from et uidit to et diuisit. 7 One of the commonest mannerisms of Tr. is to render one Latin word by two synonyms, as here,
ro therba i ro deilig. sDeas rejected by ST, but supported
by a few mss. as well as Heb. and LXX. 9Ac tenebms ST :
but numerous mss. have a tenebris. 10No authority for
amiaid sin in any version or ms. ""One day" in all versions and mss. : "the first day" in Tr. H 21. 1Deus omitted, probably by a scribal error induced by dana following. 2 Under the influence of the Latin text Tr. has dropped the article before finnamentum in the later
verses of this fl, as in the earlier redactions. 3Ab his in ST.
Only one ms. (which also has the rare reading Domini, U 20 note 5
) has ab aquis. The point is not of much critical



THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 53
importance, as Irish idiom would almost require the repetition of the substantive. ff 22. 1 Deus not in any Vulg. MS. It is, however, found
in LXX (ko.1 direv 6 deos). 2No authority for the repetition of fer in Tr., but it is practically required by Irish idiom.
3A chel no a cenel, the variant reading in B, recalls the LXX Kara y«Vo? kou Kafr' 6/xoioTrjTa. 4 The bracketed words probably
dropped by sR3
.
5Adferentem in ST forientem in OL, also found in a few Vulg. mss. fl 23. 1 Lespaireda solus-taitnemaclia, is a good illustration
of the tendency to verbosity which Tr. displays, for all his literalness. 2 Ut in ST, but there is considerable support for
et. 3 No authority for the omission of et. 4 Ut praeesset
omitted by one Vulg. MS. only. 5No authority for fecit here.
6Ac tenebras in ST. Two mss. have a tenebras, and several a tenebris. One has ac tenebris. fl 24. ^Reptile in ST : reptilia in a few mss. and some
quotations. The plural also in LXX. Wolatile in ST. Vulg. follows Heb. idiom in using a neuter singular collectively, and there is no Latin authority for the plural here. LXX, however, has the plural TreTctvd. 3Haplography by sR 3
:
probably pcalfri lost before pmcum. 4No authority for
marina, presupposed by the Irish muiridi. The latter is probably a gloss. 5Mutabilem in ST, but motabilem has
much support. 6No authority for these words. 7As before, the plural is used for singular collective. 8Deus not in Vulg.,
but LXX has o 0eo S. 9Note (
10
) in fl 20 applies here also. ff 25. 1Animam uiuentem in ST : nothing like rendering in Tr. in any version or ms. : possibly Tr. misread uiuentem as diuersam. 2 As verse (25) is almost literally identical with (24), it could easily have been passed over by a careless
or lazy scribe. 3Deus not in Vulg., but LXX has o <9eos.
4 There is some ms. authority for the omission of que. 5 This sentence lost, presumably on account of the repetition terrae
. . . terra, or its Irish equivalent. 6 The punctuation of the Latin text presupposed by Tr. is different from that usually
followed. 7No authority for the omission of Deus, or 8of quae mouentur. 9 Co follus or is falius is Tr. 's bad but invariable
rendering for ecce. 10In escam rendered by a mbiad 7 a n-ailemain: a good illustration of Tr.'s fondness for piling up
synonyms. ^Omnique uolucri in ST. No authority for the
plural in Vulg., but LXX has -n-aai to!? ireT€ivol<;.

26. (1) So the Heavens and the earth and all their
adornment were completed. (2) And God finished
upon the sixth day all the work which He did; and
God rested upon the seventh day from every work
which He accomplished. (3) And God blessed the
seventh day and hallowed it, for He rested in it from
every work which He created.
27. (4) Now these are the generations of the
Heaven and the earth, when they were created
together, in the day when the Lord God made Heaven
and earth, (5) before the earth was raising up all the
plants of the field, and before the earth was producing
the grass of the field; for God made not rain upon
the earth, and there was not there, at that time, a
man who should till the earth. (6) But from the earth would rise a spring, to moisten and to soften all the
face of the earth. (7) So God created a man out of
the clay of the common earth, and God breathed the
breath of life into his face, and the Man was made, a soul that was quickened.
When Man was made and as he had no name, God said to four angels to go in search of a name for him. Michael
went to the east, and saw a star, Anatole its name, and he brought with him the first letter of that name. Raphael
went southward, and saw a star there, Dusis its name, and
he brought its first letter. Gabriel went northward, and
saw the star called Arctos, and brought with him the first letter of the name. Uriel went westward, and saw a star

in the sunset called Mesembria, and brought with him the first letter. God said : Uriel, read these letters. Uriel said : Adam. And God said : So be it.
28. (8) Moreover God planted a Paradise of Pleasure [i.e. the place of delights] from the
beginning, and it is there that He set the man whom
He had created [, Adam]. (9) And God prepared and
created of the clay every tree pleasant and fair to
see, and every tree sweet to taste. Also God set the Tree of Life in the midst of Paradise, and the Tree
of Knowledge of Good and of Evil. (10) And a river would go past out of Paradise having four branches, to moisten and to soften Paradise, and the whole earth
in general.
Now these are the names of those four branches, and of the four streams which are [a space] beyond, out of them, through the four quarters of the earth; Phison and Geon, Tigris and Euphrates.
(11) As for Phison, [which is called the river of
Ganges, eastward straight it goeth] . It is that stream which surroundeth all the land of Euilath, that place
where gold is generated, precious and most beautiful :
(12) and there is found bdellium, and the other precious stone which is called onyx,
a stone which receiveth within itself the figures of flowers.

29. (15) Thereafter God took with Him the man [Adam, after he was fashioned and created] and set him in the Paradise of Pleasure, that he might till it [i.e. that he might plough and reap, without sweat and
without weariness,] and keep it, [i.e. that he might possess Paradise without transgressing the covenant
and commandment of God]. (16) And God commanded, having said to him : Partake and eat of the fruit of every tree that is in Paradise, (17) howbeit thou shalt not eat aught of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and of Evil, for whatsoever day thou eatest aught of the fruit of that tree, thou shalt die the death.
For sure and certain was death for him, from the day in which he should eat : for that reason said He this.
The reason why God forbade the eating of the fruit of
that tree, was that Adam might know that he was under the power and authority of the Lord.

30. (18) God said further : It is not good for a
man to be alone. Let us therefore make for him an
helper that shall be like unto him. (19) Now when
every animal of the earth was formed of clay, and
every bird of the Heaven, God brought them with
Him to Adam, to see and know by what name Adam
would call them. For this is the name that every
animal hath, the name by which Adam called it at
that time. (20) And Adam called all those animals by
their own names, and all the birds of Heaven, and
all the beasts of the Earth. But Adam could not at that time find an helper like to himself. (21) So God
sent a quiet sleep of lasting slumber upon Adam, and
as Adam slept, God took one of his ribs, and filled
its place with flesh.
This is why God enticed a sleep upon Adam, for it
[sleep] is the chosen teacher of spiritual matters and of knowledge of the future : for God filled him forthwith with a spirit of wisdom and of prophecy in that sleep.
(22) And God fashioned the rib which He took out
of Adam, so that it was a bright woman, perfect in
comeliness and in shape, and He brought her with
Him to Adam. (23) And Adam said : Lo, this is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh [this is the first
prophecy which Adam made] ; and therefore let her
name be uirago, seeing that it was of man that she was made.
This is the first bride-gift and the first prophecy which Adam made, as it is related in the Holy Scripture, Ecce os
de ossibus meis, et caro de came mea.

Notes on the Biblical Text, Chapter II.
]\ 26. ^eptimo ST sexto OL. LXX, one Vulg. ms. prima
manu and one secunda manu. 2No authority for omne.
3Deus found in one ms. only : no other authority. 4No authority for the emphatic form issed on.
ft 27. 1 Sunt not in ST, but has fair support. 2No original for imalle in any ms. 3Dominus rendered here, but not later : see notes on this fl. In the Latin mss., Deus is occasionally omitted in the combination Dominus Deus, but not Dominus.
4 The order of words in ST and all mss. and Versions is Et omne mrgultum agri antequam oreretur in terra, omnemque
herbam regionis 2^usQuam germinaret. sPriusquam, ST.
One ms. has antequam, which corresponds more closely to the Irish repetition reslu . . . reslu. But we can hardly lay any critical stress upon this. *Dominus Deus in ST and mss. : see note (
3
). Unrigans is represented in Tr. by two Irish words, ro fliuchad "\ ro bocad. This mannerism is so constant in Tr. that it is hardly necessary to call further attention to it. 8 Coitcliend, which has no original in the Versions or mss., is most likely an incorporated gloss.
1j 28. x See note (

authority for de Paradiso. 4 This part of Tr. has suffered to such an extent from the intrusions of scribes and glossators that the Latin original cannot be restored with certainty. 3 Spelt Phison in ST, but several mss. have the spelling with P. G The Irish boellium is the pardonable blunder of a
copyist. The verbosity of the rendering of ct lapis onychinus may be original, but is more probably a scribal modification,
meant to make these hard words clearer.
fl 29. *One ms. has Dominus here : Kvpios 6 #«os LXX, Dominus Deus O.L. 2Literally rendered, atbela 6 has.
Y\ 30. 1 Dcside in Tr. : no authority in Versions or mss.
2A.nnsin : no authority in Latin Vers., but conceivably Tr. looked up the Greek and misread idv as wda. The rendering of this verse is less literal than usual. Animae uiuentis is treated simply as animal, and omne is transferred from the
" names" to the ''animals." sIn tan sin: no authority in Versions or mss. 4Note the intrusive adjectives in Tr. here and after ben in the following verse. These may be due to
the original Tr., but are more probably interpolated. See fl 31 note (
1 ).
3 Is follus, as already said, represents an original ecce. Ecce also appears in the Latin quotation in the gloss, and it must have been familiar from some earlier version which also influenced R2
(fl 5 A). It is not found in any
Vulg. ms. ST has hoc nunc, LXX tovto vvv. GSumpta in ST and all authorities.

Chapter III.
31. (1) [At that time] there was a serpent, the wiliest [, the craftiest, and the subtlest] of all the beasts of the earth which God made.
Lucifer was envious against Adam : he was assured that the Heaven would be given to him in his [own] room, to fill it. Wherefore he went in the form of a serpent, and enticed sin upon Eve, in the matter of eating of the forbidden tree; so Eve made enticement upon
Adam.
This is the first question and the first enquiry which a
devil made in the world. Cur praecepit etc.
And [it is that serpent which] said unto the woman :
For what reason hath God forbidden you to eat aught
of every tree of Paradise? (2) The woman answered
the serpent : We eat of [and are sated with] the fruit of the trees that are in Paradise; (3) but God hath
commanded us not to eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of Paradise, nor even to touch it, lest
we die by a chance. (4) But the serpent said unto the
woman : Ye shall not at all die the death. (5) But God knoweth that in whatsoever day ye shall eat of the fruit of that tree, that your eyes shall be opened
[concerning evil] —that is, that ye shall be as angels, in good and evil fortune.
32. (6) So the woman saw that the tree was good
for eating and for partaking, and that it was pleasant

and agreeable to eyes and to sight : and [the woman]
took of the fruit of the tree to herself and she did eat, and gave to her husband [Adam] and he did eat.
(7) And the eyes [of mind and understanding] of those
twain were opened [to a knowledge and perception of sin, that they had not committed until that hour] ; and as they realized that they were naked, they sewed
the leaves of the fig-tree and made them aprons [of
the leaves]. (8) And they [Adam and Eve] heard the voice of the Lord [God] a-walking [in the form of an angel] in Paradise in the sound of a violent
wind, after midday. He and his wife hid them in the midst of the tree-growth of Paradise.
33. (9) And God called Adam [making use of an angelic voice], and said: Adam, where art thou?
(10) Howbeit Adam answered and said : I heard Thy
voice in Paradise, and fear laid hold on me, for I was
naked, and I hid me. (11) God said : Who told thee that thou wast naked, other than Myself! Hast thou eaten fruit of the Tree which I forbade thee?

and thy progeny [i.e. thou shalt have many monthly
.sicknesses]. And under the power of a man shalt thou be, and his lordship shall be over thee. (17) Moreover
God said to Adam : In that thou hast hearkened to the voice and incitement of thy wife, and in that thou hast eaten of the tree that I forbade thee, cursed is the earth in thy deed. It shall be in labours and in tribulations that thou shalt eat food, for all the days
of thy life. (18) And the earth shall bring forth for
thee sharp thorns, and spiny brushwood, (19) and it shall be in the sweat of thy face [and in the servitude of thy body and of thy frame] thou shalt eat of the
plants and fruits of the earth and shalt be satisfied
with victuals, till He shall have laid thee again
under( &) the earth from which God made thee. For it is of dust and of earth that he was made, and under it shall he go.

[i.e. of mankind]. (21) Moreover God made for Adam
and for his wife tunics and mantles of hides, and clothed them.
36. (22) And God said : Lo, Adam hath been made
as one of us, having a knowledge of good and of evil
As though what God would say was : Adam obtained not the thing which he desired, to be as one of us. But he
changed and neglected the goodness and the original purity in which he was made.
So let us drive him now forth from Paradise, lest he should eat aught of the Tree of Life, and lest he
should be alive for ever. (23) Wherefore God drave
Adam forth from the Paradise of Pleasure, and set him in the common earth of which he was made. (24) And God ordained a Seraph in the forefront of
Paradise, with a fiery sword in his hand, to guard Paradise and the way of the Tree of Life.

31. (1) Sed et serpens erat ^allidior eunctis animantibus terrae quae fecerat [Dominus] Deus; qui dixit ad mulierem : Cur praecepit Deus uobis ut non comederitis de omni ligno Paradisi! (2) Cui respondit mulier : De fructu lignorum quae sunt in Paradise- ueseemur, (3) de fructu uero ligni quod est in medio Paradisi praecepit nobis Deus ne comederemus, et ne tangeremus illud, ne 2forte moriamur. (4) Dixit autem serpens ad mulierem : Nequaquam morte moriemini, (5) scit enim Deus quod in quocunque die comederitis ex eo,
aperientur oculi uestri, et eritis sicut 3angeli, scientes bonum
et malum.
32. (6) Vidit igitur mulier quod bonum esset lignum ad uescendum, et ^ulchrum oculis, aspectuque deleetabile; et tulit de fructu illius et comedit, deditque uiro suo qui comedit. (7) Et aperti sunt oculi amborum, cumque cognouissent esse se nudos, consuerunt folia ficus et fecerunt sibi perizomata. (8) Et 2audiuerunt voeem Domini 3 [Dei] deambulantis in Paradiso 4 [ad auram] post meridiem. Abscondit se et uxor eius 5 [a facie Domini Dei] in medio ligni Paradisi.
33. (9) Vocauitque [Dominus] Deus Adam et dixit :
x <Adam> ubi es? (10) 2Respondit uero Adam dicens : Vocem tuam audiui in Paradiso et timui, eo quod nudus essem, et abscondi me. (11) [Cui] dixit 3<Deus> : Quis [enim] in
dicauit tibi quod nudus esses 4nisi egometl Ex ligno de
quo tibi praeceperam ne comederes comedisti? (12) Dixitque
Adam : Mulier quam dedisti sociam mihi dedit mihi de ligno, et comedi. (13) Et dixit [Dominus] Deus ad mulierem: Quare hoc fecisti? 5Hoc est quod respondit mulier: Serpens decepit me, et comedi.
34. (14) Et ait Dominus ^Deus] ad serpentem : Quia fecisti hoc, maledictus es inter omnia animantia et bestias terrae. Super pectus tuum gradieris, et terrain comedis eunctis diebus uitae tuae. (15) 2 [Et] inimieitias ponam inter
te et mulierem, et 3 [inter] semen tuum et semen illius. Ipsa conteret caput tuum, 4 et insidiaberis calcaneo eius. (16) Mulieri quoque dixit: Multiplicabo aerumnas tuas et

5 coneeptus tuos : in dolore paries filios, et sub uiri potestate
eris, et ipse dominabitur tui. (17) Ad Adam vero dixit 6 [Deus] : Quia audisti 7 uocem [et temptationem] uxoris tuae, et comedisti de ligno ex quo praeceperam tibi ne comederes, maledicta terra in opere tuo : in laboribus comedes 8e[se]am cunctis diebus uitae tuae. (18) Spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi, et comedes herbas terrae, (19) in sudore uultus tui uesceris 9 pane, donee reuertaris in terram de qua 10fecit tc Deus, quia puluis es, et in puluerem reuerteris.
35. (20) Et uocauit Adam nomen uxoris suae xEua, eo quod mater esset cunctorum uiuentium. (21) Fecit quoque
[Dominus] Deus Adam et uxori eius tunicas pellicias, et induit eos.
36. (22) x Et ait 2<Deus> : Ecce Adam factus est quasi unus ex nobis, sciens bonum et malum : nunc ergo, ne 3 [forte
mittat manum suam et] sumat etiam de Ligno Vitae, et comedat et uiuat in aeternum, <emittamus eum de Paradiso>. (23) Emisit 5 <ergo> eum [Dominus] Deus de Paradiso Voluptatis G et posuit eum in terra de qua factus est. (24) 7 [Eiecitque Adam] et collocauit <Deus> ante Paradisum
[Voluptatis] Cherubin, et flammeum gladium 8 [atque uersatilem] ad custodiendam uiam Ligni Vitae.

a chance, accident," and in a good sense "from a windfall," suggests that the translator did not completely understand

Jewish exegesis, possibly conveyed to Tr. by some commentary. Skinner quotes Abraham ibn Ezra, t c. 1167.
U 32. xTr. has missed the elegant chiasmus of the Latin.
2 Cum audissent in ST and Vulg. mss. Tr. here follows LXX in making the clause independent (as in Heb.) : k-ai ijk-ovaav Ti)i> (j}fri)v k.t.X. 3 By exception, Domini is here translated.
Only one Vulg. MS. omits Dei. 4Ad auram has been curiously misunderstood by Tr. "'These words must have been lost from the Irish text at an early date by some carelessness, which
in this case it is impossible to explain.
fl 33. \LXX and a few Vulg. mss. insert Adam here.
2Nearer to LXX (koi tlntv uvto)) than to Vulg. (qui ait).
Adam may or may not be here an intrusive gloss. sDeus rejected by ST, but found in several mss. and ancient
quotations. 4 In Vulg., quod nudus esses, nisi quod ex ligno,
etc. (so in LXX, rig avi'iyyttXiv <toj ... 1 1 fin k.t.A.) This must have been the reading in A, but quod must have been written in such a way that Tr. misread it as a contraction
for egomet, thus producing the nonsense acht Me fein, which,
naturally, has given some trouble to his copyists. He then
began a new sentence with Ex ligno, thus accidentally falling into accord with the Hebrew punctuation. 5 Slightly closer
to LXX (k-al ilnev ?j ywi)) than to Vulg. (quae respondit).
fl 34. 2 Only two mss. omit Deus. 2No authority in Vulg.
for inserting et, but LXX has koi. It also has (like Tr.) Ixfyoai'in the singular, unlike Vulg., in which inimicitiam
has very slender authority. 3No authority for repetition of
inter in Vulg., but found in LXX. This point is of no
critical importance, howrever, as the repetition is practically required by Irish idiom. 4As suggested in the notes to this fl, Tr. does not seem to have completely understood this passage : his rendering is rather free. 5 Tr. seems to have regarded conceptus tuos as linked to the following words, governed by paries rather than by midtiplicabo, and to have supplied in imagination et before filios. 6No authority for Deus here. 7 i aslach is possibly another instance of Tr. 's

fondness for duplication, but it may also be an intrusive
gloss. s eam in Vulg., avri,,- in LXX. Apparently Tr. took
earn for a contraction of escam. 9A gloss has ousted the original translation of this simple word. 10Sumptus eo, Vulg. For a similar translation compare II. 23.
ff 35. 1 Hauam in ST, but there is plenty of authority for Eua, as well as some for Aeua, Aeuam, and Euam.
fl 30. 1 This 1| has suffered considerably in translation or
transmission. 2No Latin authority for Deus, but LXX has
Kvpioi; 6 Bsog. 3 The equivalent of these words was lost early,
presumably because two consecutive sentences began with na ro. 4 There is an effective rhetorical aposiopesis in the text here, in all versions from Heb. downwards. But Tr., assuming that something had dropped from the text, has
made an attempt at filling the gap! 5No authority for
imorro, but LXX and a few Vulg. mss. have nal, et. a Ut operaretur terrain de qua sumptus est in ST. Tr. has here
gone altogether off the rails. We have already seen reason
to suspect (fi 33 note (
4
) above) that the handwriting of A was not perfectly clear to him, and it is conceivable that ut operaretur was so written as to be read carelessly as et posnit eum in. Once more we see sumptus translated as though it were factus (cf. II 23, III 19). 7 Possibly Tr. or one of his copyists thought these words superfluous after ro dhlchuir, just before. 8I n-a laimh appears to be a gloss that has ousted the Latin atque uersatilem.

37. It is evident from this that so long as they were in
Paradise, they were virgins. (1) Now Adam knew Eua his wife. She conceived and brought forth Cain to him.
Cain, possessio or lamentatio interpretatur, i.e. this is the explanation and meaning which is in that word, "Cain";
i.e. "possession." And to set forth that meaning Adam said "Caneithi," i.e.
I have acquired a man through God. (2) And Eua
brought forth again another son, Abel. Thus was
Abel, a shepherd of sheep, and Cain, an husbandman was he. (3) It came to pass, moreover, after many days, that Cain would offer gifts of the fruits of the
earth to God : (4) but Abel made offerings of the choice
firstlings of his flock to God. And the Lord looked
upon Abel and upon his gifts, (5) but He looked not upon Cain and upon his gifts.
Thus did Cain understand that the gifts of Abel were acceptable to God, but that his own gifts were not accept

able—in that fire would come from Heaven upon the offerings of Abel, but would not come upon the offerings of Cain.
and Cain was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell % in distress and in gloom. ||
38. (0) And the Lord said unto Cain : Wherefore wast thou wroth, and wdierefore hath thy countenance
fallen [in distress] ! (7) How now, said God, shalt
thou not obtain its equivalent if thou doest well ? But if it be evil that thou doest, vengeance for it shall be
nigh unto thee. (8) And Cain said unto Abel his
brother : Let us go out into the field. After they had gone into the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him,
In the city which is called Damascus.
Now Abel was the first dead man of the world, and he was the first martyr that ever was ; and with good will he made confession in martyrdom.
(9) And God said unto Cain : Where is Abel thy
brother? Cain answered: I know not. How now,
[said Cain], is it I who am custodian for my brother?

THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 85
This is one of the first two lies—the devil first and Cain afterwards.
(10) And God ,said unto Cain : What hast thou done? The voice and cry of thy brother's blood maketh
complaint and call unto me from the earth.
There are three cries which made their way to God without delay : the cry of the blood of kin-murder, as the cry of the blood of Abel after it was shed by Cain his brother : the cry of iniquitous sin, as the cry of the sin of the Sodomites : and the cry and lamentation of the poor, when their goods have been taken from them and when
they have been slaughtered.
39. (11) Thou also ,shalt be accursed upon the earth [and the earth also shall be accursed] which hath
opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother
[after it had been shed] at thy hand.
For the sacred historians consider that it was with a shank of a camel-bone that Cain slew his brother, as he tended sheep.

yield her fruits unto thee : and thou shalt be a
wanderer and a fugitive [from place to place] upon
the earth. (13) And Cain said unto God : Greater and
linger is my iniquity than that I deserve forgiveness.
It was despair that Cain expressed there when he said these words : Thou, God, shalt not receive, and shalt
not give me forgiveness, though I should work repentance. That was a blasphemy of God on his part,
(14) Lo, said Cain, Thou hast driven me today from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from Thy face. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer upon the
earth, and anyone shall slay me, and shall not spare
me. (15) And God said unto Cain : Not thus shall it be done : but everyone who shall slay Cain shall be punished sevenfold.
i.e. Sudden death is not the remedy for sin that thou shalt obtain as thou thinkest : but thou shalt live long, so that thy punishment may be the greater.
God set Cain in a sign, so that no man should slay
him
a. lump upon his forehead [and a lump (on) each of his cheeks, and a lump on each foot and on each hand]
and his being beardless, and being a fugitive.

40. (16) Then Cain departed from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt, a wild fugitive, in the eastern
border of the land called Eden
The land which is in the east of Asia.
(.17) Cain knew his wife, and she conceived a ,son,
Enoch ; and he founded a city and gave it a name from
the name of his son, Enoch. (18) And Enoch begat Irad, and Irad begat Maviahel, Maviahel begat
Mathusahel. Mathusahel begat Lamech [the bigamist,
i.e. (so called) from the two wives].
41. (19) Now that Lamech took two wives, Ada and
Sella their names. (20) And Ada bore label ; he it is who was father [and chief] of shepherds and of those
who used to dwell in tents [and in desert places]. (21) Iubal, moreover, was the name of his brother : he
it is who was father [and leader] of those who would
handle harps and organs. (22) And Sella bore a son to the same Lamech, Tubalcain his name. He,

the first carpenter. And Sella bore a daughter thereafter, Noemma, sister of Tubalcain.
She was the first weaver, and the first who fashioned raiment for everyone in the beginning.
42. (23) And Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella : Ye wives of Lamech, hear my voice, heed and
understand my word. For I have slain a man without,
today, and it is the very same thing that I wounded
(him) there. He injured me, and through jealousy I slew7 that tender youth.
And he thought it a deed for boasting, for it was through his haughtiness and in vainglory that he spoke.
(24) He then who shall slay Cain, it shall be revenged
upon him sevenfold : but he who shall slay Lamech, shall be punished seventy and seven times the
equivalent.

j| 38. x This verse, of which the best commentators can make but little, is baldly paraphrased by Tr., who has omitted the unintelligible last clause altogether. 2 The Irish is closer
to LXX (6tt\0t,ifxt%i tic t" TTetiuv). The original is lost from the Massoretic Hebrew text, but must be supplied (the English Revised Version makeshift "and Cain told Abel his brother" is inadmissible). sDominus in ST, but 6 Oeog in
LXX. 4Deus omitted in Vulg., but o Otnt,- in LXX. One
Vulg. ms. has Dominus. sEum ST and all mss. No
equivalent in LXX.
fl 39. 1 > 3 These two similar passages are necessary to the sense, and presumably were in the original text of Tr. It is a curious coincidence that they should both have disappeared. 2In omitted by ST, but there is authority for it, as for in Cain signum and in signum Cain.
H 40. x
n ro thuisim was probably in the text originally,
but dropped out early. 2Filium nomine found in four mss., but ST omits.
jj 41. 1 This name is spelt with one d in all Versions and mss. 2 The interpolated mac don Laimhiaeh ceadna doubtless
was originally a gloss explaining the personality of Tupalcan (Tubalcain). There is no authority behind the statement in Tr. that he was the first craftsman in his trades. 3 There is no authority for the verbose Irish ocus rug Sella ingen iar sin.
U 42. 1 Tr. here follows Vulg. against other Versions in transferring the names of the wives from the beginning of
the song (where the poetical structure requires them) to the prose introductory matter. The translation of the song is
corrupt, and as it stands is partly unintelligible. See the notes to this If.
fl 43. 1A seitig has been extruded from the text by the
gloss .i. Eua. 2 The speaker was certainly Eve, not Adam. The latter name, for which there is no authority whatever,
is doubtless an interpolation.

Chapter V.
44. (1) Now this is the book [of Genesis, or of the
Old Testament canon] of the creation of Adam. In
the day in which God created Man under His own
likeness (2) He created man and woman, and blessed
them, and gave them the name from Adam [i.e. man] in the day wherein they were created.
y
1 Those skilled in sacred history consider that God gave no blessing to Adam after he committed the sin.
y
2 At the end of six hours and a half of the day did
Adam and Eve commit the sin, namely the eating of the Tree of Knowledge, by the incitement of the serpent.
(3) An hundred and thirty years had Adam complete
when Seth was born to him, (4) and the days of Adam
after the birth of Seth to him were made eight hundred
years, and he begat sons and daughters. (5) And all
the life of Adam was made nine hundred and thirty
years, and Adam died thereafter.
And he was buried in the city which is called Hebron, so that his body was in that place till the Flood came over the world : and the waves of the Flood sundered his body and his head each from the other, and the waves carried the head with them from Hebron to Golgotha. It abode
in Golgotha till the Crucifixion of Christ. And it was
through the head of Adam that the end of the Cross came : and the blood of the Lord fell over the face of Adam, and
thus was Adam baptized for the first time, according to men skilled in sacred history.
45. (6) An hundred and five years were complete
for Seth, when Enos was born to him. (7) Five hundred and seven years was the life of Seth after

And it was in waste and desert places, away from the
common life of every man, that that man was living for a season,

Tl" 44. ^he punctuation, doubtless by accident, follows the OL. But there is no authority for the substitution of suam
for Dei. 2 This passage was perhaps dropped from Tr. owing to an eye-confusion induced by the similar passage in the
preceding verse.
fl 45-49. In the ages of the Patriarchs Tr. follows the
authority of LXX (and Isidore) as against Vulg. This is
shown in the following table. (A = age of each patriarch at
birth of firstborn, B = years lived after firstborn, C = total
age.)



THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 105
In the Irish text .xl. has boon miswritten for .lx. in the age of Methuselah, and in the age of Lamech a "c" has been omitted. The 677 years of Lamech 's age is a mere copyist's mistake which has here been corrected in the text, .dc. having been written instead of .dec. The reduction of the age of
Seth by 300 years has no authority.
fl 50. x This paragraph has been much worked over by the interpolation and assimilation of details from the apocrypha of Enoch. It has almost parted company with the Latin
original.
ft 52. 1 There is here a hint that Tr. is for the moment becoming weary of his work. He does not show his usual care in finding different words for operibus et laboribus : contrast verses 4, 5 of this chapter, where he has duly observed the difference of dies and tempus (laitheada, sdegal). The rendering (or more probably the transmission) of the paragraph is rather too free for any certain establishment of the Latin text. 2 It is uncertain whether iarsin, the last word before the lacuna, belongs to v. 31 (where the Latin does not call for it) or begins the lost v. 32, which enumerated the sons of Noah.

53. . . . God forbade the descendants of Seth to mingle
friendship with those of Cain, or to beget children by them, or to take wives from them. In spite of that, however, when the descendants of Seth saw them, they took the beautiful daughters of the descendants of Cain. They
transgressed the commandment, and had children by them in despite of God. Wherefore there were born giants and dwarfs and every unshapely monstrous being that was among the people of the world before the Flood.
Others say however that it is not of them that they were
found : it is of the seed of Ham.
54. (3) And God said : My Spirit shall not remain
longer in man [i.e. in man] for he is flesh [i.e.
for the exceeding greatness of his (sins? ...)]: and
the days of man shall be brought to a close at the end
of an hundred and twenty years. (4) Now there were
gigantes upon the earth at that time, [i.e. champions of the warlike sons and the fleshly daughters of Cain.]
55. (5) Now when God saw
that they were transgressing the covenant [in wrath, in treachery, in . . . ., in pride, in impiety], He determined to annihilate and to destroy all men.
"Wherefore God said : (7) I shall root out, said He,
Man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, [(so there was brought) destruction upon all the beasts

56. (11) Now the earth was corrupted and filled
with evil [and with the iniquity of men], (12) and

timbers chipped and smoothed
so that never was made nor shall be made a ship like unto
it in size, in firmness, in trustworthiness, and in good craftsmanship.
And thus was it made, with four sides to it.
Make also within it many various chambers, and let
the ark be smooth inside and out with pitch.
Now this is the nature that pitch possesses, that no
worms, nor 'winds, nor water, nor sun-heat destroys the timbers that have been placed in it.
(15) And make three hundred cubits in the length of the ark, and fifty cubits in its breadth, and thirty cubits
in its height. (16) And make a window in the ark, and one cubit in its thickness.
These are its materials, glue and pitch and clay, [that is, mould of the land of Syria]. It was Dia Anarlaoite who mixed these materials together, by the revelation of God. He was brother to Epiphenius, the

God said unto Noe : Make, moreover, the door of the
ark in its side, and make chambers within it, with separating roof-beams between them.
58. (17) Lo [said God] I shall bring the water of the Flood over the earth, to ,slay altogether flesh in which is a spirit of life beneath the heaven, and there shall be termination and end upon all that are in the
earth. (18) And I shall make a compact with thee : and thou shalt go into the ark, thou and thy wife
[Coba, daughter of Lamech, thy sister] and thy sons and the wives of thy sons together with thee [and of
thee were they born on both sides]. (19) And thou shalt take with thee into the ark a pair of every animal, in each shape that is on the earth, in order to preserve their life [and for seeding from them after
the Flood]. (21) Thou shalt take also with thee into

H 57. x This H has been rendered with tolerable literalness ;
only in one place does Tr. stray from the text—where he, renders the corrupt and unintelligible in cubito consummabis summitatem as though it meant that the walls of the ark should be a cubit thick. This is also the theory of the author
of the poem no. V : but the text cannot bear this meaning.
The rendering of tristega, "storey," by feice, "roof-beam," is noteworthy. The paragraph is so farced with glosses that it is difficult to keep on the track of the biblical narrative.
fl 58. 1 The long passage here omitted enumerated the birds,
cattle, reptiles, etc. It must have been in Tr. originally, for it is presupposed by the et reliqua of the gloss following. Probably some impatient scribe dropped them as being irrelevant to the main purpose of the present text.

Thou shalt take with thee sets of two of the unclean animals, male and female. (3) Thou shalt take with thee moreover sets of seven of the clean birds of heaven, male and female.

and it was an hundred and fifty days without drying up.
On the seventeenth day of the second month [the month of May] the Flood began to pour: on that day [i.e. on the seventeenth of the second month,] Noe, his company of
eight persons, went into the ark.
("•3) In the article, [that is, in the beginning] of the
daj in which all the animals assembled, by the
command and power of God, to the ark to enter it, [it is then exactly that it was filled] the broad-keeled deep ark was fully ordered.
It was the product of the labour of skilled craftsmen, with boarding of beauty and strength.
62. (15) Now after Noe went into his ark, with his
company of eight persons, and when all the creatures
and all the manifold various beasts were assembled within it, (16) with all the things in store, which God
had commanded Noe, God shut the ark from the outside, (17) and there was a downpour upon the earth
for a space of forty days and forty nights. And the waters increased, and the waters bore the ark aloft from off the earth (18) upon the waves of the Flood.
And the ark was swimming from place to place.
63. (19) The water increased and augmented upon the earth (20) till it reached fifteen cubits above every
highest hill that was under the whole heaven. (21) And
destruction and a general common death was brought
upon all men, (22) and upon all that had a spirit of life upon the earth,
for their haughtiness and lack of humility toward God.

have interlined .i. seinistir. When this 5 became g, the .i. as usual slipped into "|.

64. (1) But God was mindful of [and had compassion
upon] the ,said Noe, and all the animals and all
the cattle that were with Noe in his ark. And God sent a wind [to suck up the water], and the water
decreased. (2) And the well-spring of the deep and
the sluices of Heaven were closed, and the showers
from Heaven were withheld. (3) And the waters were restored to the earth into the places whence they had come, and the waters decreased at the end of an
hundred and fifty days. (4) Seventy and seven days and iseven months was the ark from wave to wave, till it took rest in a mountain of Armenia. (5) The waters were drying up till the tenth month. Upon the
first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains
appeared.
65. (6) At the end of forty days thereafter Noe opened the window of the ark and let out the raven (7) and it came not again. (8) [On the seventh day
thereafter] he let out the dove
and closed the ark after the dove, for fear of the winds
(9) And the dove came back, for it found no place where it should stand,
and descended upon the ark, as it found it not opened,
and made a working with its beak upon the board
and Noe stretched his hand forth for the dove and brought it with him into the ark. (10) Then he let the
dove out again at the end of the seven days, (11) and it came in the evening [of the same day] with a twig of an olive-tree having its fresh leaves in its beak.
And Noe blessed it, and cursed the raven; and for that,

God gave the colour of the former to the raven, and the sheen of the raven to the other, for the insubordination of the raven. Noe understood that the waters were decreased. (12) Howbeit, he waited other seven days and then
let out the dove for the third time, and it came not
againfor there was no need.
66. (13) On the first day of the first year [after the
Flood], upon the isucking-up of the waters, Noe
loosened the door of the ark and looked on the earth round about him. (14) On the twenty-seventh day of
the first month God came to speak with him, (15) and
thus God spake unto Noe : (16) Rise from out the ark,
said He, thou and thy wife and thy sons and the wives of thy sons, (17) and take with thee all the beasts that
are in the ark, and step forth upon the earth.
Increase and be ye multiplied upon the earth. (18) So Noe went out of the ark,
in the twenty-seventh day [of the moon of May] of the second month : that is, the secondary month of May in the first year.
Six hundred years were complete for Noe at that time.
One thousand six hundred fifty and six years from the
creation of Adam till then, ut dixit,
Poem no. VII.
—and further the wife of Noe went, and his sons and
the wives of his sons (19) and all the beasts that were in the ark went out of it.
On the twenty-seventh day of the same secondary month,
he came out of it : as regards the day of the week, on

Friday. So that thence Noe was a year and sixteen
<da.ys> in the ark. On the seventeenth day of the same month, [that is, the month of May], the Flood began to
shower : on the tenth of the moon [of the second month] of the month, Noe went into the ark with his company of eight persons, and with all the animals and beasts that he took with him into it. These were, a couple of every wild creature, whatsoever should be for seeding; to wit four
human pairs, fourteen pairs of birds, seven pairs of species of fish and a pair of every different kind from that onwards, that were in the ark. As regards the day of the week, it was a Friday that Noe went into the ark, and Tuesday they came out of it afterwards, ut dicitur,
Poem no. VIII.
67. Now when the Flood was brought over the world, all men were drowned save Noe and his three sons and their four wives, as we have said above. For Noe is the second
Adam, to whom the men of the world are traced : and
Enoch is the innocent ( 1) Adam : but Christ is the last Adam, by whom the seed of the aforesaid three, already
mentioned, were saved, when He gave Himself on the cross of suffering instead of those three, after their time, and
brought the harrowingi over Hell by which the people of the five Ages all at once were saved.
68. Six hundred years were complete for Noe when the Flood came over the world : three hundred and fifty years was Noe in life after the Flood : so all that makes nine hundred and fifty years. For Noe is one of the four men
of the seed of Adam, of whom the Canon telleth that had
longest life—namely Adam, Iared, Mathusalam, and Noe. Nine hundred and thirty years was the life of Adam.. Nine hundred sixty and two years the life of Iared. Nine hundred sixty and nine years the life of Mathusalam. Nine
hundred and fifty years the life of Noe : as is said here

On the displacement of this passage see p. 11 ff. It is not necessary to print the Latin original here : Tr. adheres to Vulg., and ignores LXX, which inserts an additional
generation (Kaivav. between Arfaxad and Sale), and has several differences in the numerical statements of the ages. The only deviations in Tr. from ST are the age of Eber (130
instead of 430) and of Ecu (35 before son's birth, 204 after

human heart are given over and subdued to work wickedness. I shall not slay, moreover, from henceforth every living soul as I have done. (22) But all

as of every green thing, (4) except only one thing : ye shall not eat of flesh with the blood thereof. (5) For I shall demand and require your blood of all beasts
and of all men, and I shall demand the life of every
man from every one who shall slay him. (6) For evervone that shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed in turn : under the image and likeness of God
was man made. (7) But ye, said God to Noe and his sons, increase and be ye multiplied and fill the earth.
80. (8) Moreover God said unto Noe and his sons,
(9) I shall ordain, and there shall be, My friendship
with you and upon your progeny after you (10) and
with all that came out of the Ark. (11) And I shall not bring a Flood over the world again,
except when the common end of every man shall come about in the Day of Judgement.
(13) Moreover, I shall put a sign of My friendship to
you in the Heaven, and so long as that sign shall be
seen from Heaven (15) there shall be no end nor
common death upon men. This is the sign, My bow arching in the Heaven.
Therefore for that purpose is the rainbow, given for a sign of friendship to the progeny of Noe after the Flood, that God shall be united with them so long as the rainbow is seen. Howbeit it is clear from this that the rainbow did not exist before the Flood,
and that it shall not have being for fifteen years before the Judgement.

81. (20) Now Noc began to work husbandry, and
planted a vineyard. (21) And on a time, after those
things, Noe went into his tent to drink wine.
Drunkenness seized hold on him, and his sleep fell
on him, and his raiment slipped down from him, so
that he was naked in his tent. (22) Thereafter came
Ham father of Canaan, in to him, and saw the shameful members of his father which had become uncovered, and he made a mock of him. Then he went out ; and he tells his brethren [Iafeth and Sem] how that their
father was naked. (23) So Sem and Iafeth came into the tent; and in this manner they went, with their backs forward, that they should not see the nakedness
of their father : and they put his raiment over him
and left him asleep, and came again away from him.
(24) Now when Noe arose from his sleep, the doings of those sons were revealed to him ; and then his father cursed Ham, and thus he spake : (25) Cursed and corrupt is Ham, and he shall be as it were a slave of
slaves for his brethren. (26) And Noe said : Let the
Lord bless the aforesaid Sem, and let Ham be in service to him; (27) and let God enlarge Iafeth, and
let him dwell in the tents of Sem, and let Ham be in service to Iafeth.
So that this Ham is the first man who was cursed after the Flood : and thereafter there were born dwarfs and giants and horse
heads and every unshapely form in general that there is among
men
Thereafter there was brought [as it were] ( a) destruction upon the Canaanites, and their land was given to the sons of Israel, in token of those same curses. For the Canaanites were of the seed of Ham, and it is through that same curse
that there was the destruction of the children of Dardan
and Ioph, so that each of them slew his fellow.

so that that was the origin of the monsters.
(a) See the note on this paragraph.

Notes on the Biblical Text, Chapter IX.
fi 79. a This part of the verse has probably been lost owing to confusion caused by the repetition of the equivalents of
mouentur . . . mouetur. A glossator, observing the omission of the reference to fishes, inserted it in oratio obliqua, which betrays the intrusion.
ff80. *As in previous passages, glossarial interpolations
borrowed from Sex Aetates Mundi have here ousted the biblical lemmata; and though the framework of the Latin



THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 139
original is preserved, the words of the text cannot be completely recovered. ff 81. a The remarks on the preceding paragraph are
applicable here, if anything, to yet greater extent. 2 There
is slight support in the mss. of both LXX and Vulg., for the
substitution of Cham for Chanaan (or Chandan) : but (ft) such an obvious, if inaccurate, change could have been made at any stage independently, and (b) it must have been made in
the H tradition subsequently to the incorporation of the interpolated passages.
The following notes, which should follow ]\ 85 (pp. 142-3),
are printed here for typographical convenience :
82. (32) Haec familiae Noe iuxta populos et nationes suas : ab his divisae sunt gentes in terra post diluuium. 83. (1) Erat autem terra labii unius et sermonum eorundem 84. (2) (3) Dixitque alter ad proximum suum : Venite faciamus lateres, et coquamus eos igni. Habuerantque lateres pro saxis et bitumen pro cemento. (4) Et dixerunt : Venite faciamus nobis ciuitatem et turrem cuius culmen
pertingat ad caelum, et celebremus nomen nostrum, antequam diuidamur in universas terras. 85. (5) Descendit autem Deus ut uideret ciuitatem et
turrem quam aedificabant filii Adam : (6) Et dixit Deus, Ecce,
unus est populus et unum labium omnibus : coeperuntque hoc facere, nee desistent a cogitationibus suis donee eas opere compleant. (7) [Venite igitur] descendamus et confundamus
ibi linguam eorum, ut non audiat unusquisque uocem proximi
sui. (8) Atque ita diuisit eos Dominus ex illo loco in universas
terras, et cessauerunt aedificare ciuitatem (9) Ed idcirco uocatum est nomen eius Babel, quia ibi confusum est labium uniuersae terrae, et inde dispersit eos Deus super faciem cunctarum regionum.
TT 82. This, the only surviving portion of the "Table of Nations," is very freely paraphrased in Tr.
The rendering of Chapter XI, 1-9, is useless for critical purposes : the story has been practically re-written ; inflated (after the manner of the later romances) with cumbrous accumulations of adjectives; and rendered partly unintelli
gible, especially in verses 4 and 6, by intrusive glosses.

82. (32) So the children of Noe increased and multiplied npon the earth as God said unto them : and they divided and parted the earth between them after the Flood.
Chapter XI.
83. (1) Now the earth was in this wise at that time,
all men that were upon it having one and the same
language,
and Gorthigern was its name, i.e. the Hebrew language,
until the languages were separated at the Tower, That
came to pass in this manner, when a wonderful lawless deed was done in the world at that time once again.
84. [An] intolerable [famine ? ? seized the] men of the world at that time [and there could not be fo]und a trough (?) of the fruit of the [ ] earth
in the east where they were. (3) And each said to
the other [go to,] that we may dry the very red, very stiff . . . bright heated clay, that it may be as solid
as hard .... rough rocks. Let there also be made by us the smooth ever- [stiff?] pitch : for their beautiful lime of uniform colour. (4) Moreover they said further :
.... and let there be made by us a fair-erected castle, and a strong everlastingly founded fortress. Let there
be also made by us a very great, wide, royal, lofty, tall, tower, that the ridgepole of the summit of that
tower may reach [that men may see] the heavens,
[or above the high upper air] . And thus let our name
be magnified and enlarged from on high in glory,
before we be divided and scattered through lands
distant and strange. And this deed was wholly done by them.

85. (5) Now God descended to see the city and the
tower which the sons of Adam were building
i.e. the sons of the wretched, earthy, man of sin : that
is a reproach hi the divine scripture, to call them 'sons of Adam.'
(6) And God said : Lo, all men are as it were one people, and they have one language ; and they will not cease from the purposes which they have begun, till they have fulfilled them. (7) Let us therefore confuse and crush their smooth, gentle, tuneful speech, that none of them may understand the voice of another.
(8) So that people was confused, maddened, and caused
to err, with the multitude of the different unknown languages : and thus they left off from their deeds
which they had begun to do. (9) Wherefore the name
of that place was called "Babel," i.e. "confusion": for there all the languages of the world were confused, to wit the seventy-two languages, from the three sons of Noe. God scattered those nations into the whole earth.
86. Noe divided the world into three parts among his
sons : Sem in Asia, Ham in Africa, Iafeth in Europe. And each of them died in his own division. Sem died on the summit of Sliab Radruip of the heat of the sun, Iafeth died
on the summit of Sliab Armenia, Ham died on the summit of Sliab Rafan. So that the following song was said of
that matterPoem no. V.

envy and jealousy, with a shaft of a camel-bone. Wherefore God brought a Flood over the whole earth.
Now never was son born of father at the end of a year save
[from] Adam only : for it is true that one year of Adam was
not complete, if indeed it was quite complete, when Cain was conceived.
88. As for Setli, son of Adam, one of the three
eminent sons which Adam had, from him are the men of the whole earth. [Noe s. Lamech s. Mathusalam
s. Enoch s. Iared s. Malalehel s. Cainan s. Enos s. Seth
s. Adam]. Now Noe is the second Adam, to whom
are traced the men of the whole earth. For the Flood
drowned the seed of Adam save Noe and his three sons, Sem, Ham, Iafeth, and their four wives Coba, Olla, Oliva, Olivana.
The progeny of Adam sinned [fell] ; so God brought a Flood over the whole earth, so that not one escaped from it alive except the people of the ark, to wit Noe and his three sons, Sem, Ham, Iafeth, with their four wives Coba, Olla, Oliva, and Olivana.

THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 149
91. Now the number of those peoples increased beyond
the numbers of the languages ; for there are in Africa many
peoples having- one language, and no change of tongue. This is the reason thereof, that there were only seventytwo peoples yonder at the Tower, when the languages were separated : and though the peoples were multiplied, they were not multiplied in the computation of different peoples, but were left as a. subordinate company of the peoples nearest to them. So that the nations are greater
in substance than the languages, though they are not greater in number.
92. So that it is from those three sons of Noe that the seventy-two peoples were born after the Flood, with their
seventy-two languages that were given to them thereafter,
at the confusion of Nemrod's Tower. And it was at the end of ten years thereafter that Feinius Farsaid extracted the language of the Gaedil out of the seventy-two languages.
Sem had thirty [or twenty seven] sons, including
Arfaxad, Assur, Persius
and it is of his seed that the Hebrews come. These are the
five sons from whom he had descendants, Elam, Assur, Arfaxad,
Lud, and Aram : and though five sons of Sem are named, I do not give in enumeration the descent of more than two of them.
Ham had thirty sons, including Chus, Mesraim, Flit, Chanaan,
and though thirty sons of Ham are named, I do not give in enumeration the descent of more than two of them.

Iafeth had fifteen,
including Danai, Gregus, Espanus, Gomerus : or
[Sem] had twenty-seven sons.
Or perhaps these are the names
of the sons of Iafeth—Gomer, Magog
, Madai, Iavan, Tubal, Mosoch, Tiras, Maisechda.
And I do not give in enumeration the descent of more than three of them. It is not the case that the other sons had no descendants : but none were born from them worthy of being called ' ' a people. ' '
Thus it is that those peoples were descended, twenty-seven from Sem, thirty from Ham, fifteen from Iafeth, ut dicitur
Poem no. III.
93. Iafeth son of Noe, of him is the northern side of Asia and the people of all Europe. Sem over the middle of. Asia, from the river Euphrates to the eastern region of
the world. Ham settled in Africa and on the southern side of Asia.
94. As for Iafeth, it is his progeny which we shall
follow now. From him is the northern side of all Asia, namely Asia Minor, and Armenia, and the people of

Scythia; and from him are Graecia Parva, and Graecia
Magna, and Alexandrian Greece. Of him also are the
people of all Europe.
Moreover it is of his progeny that is every Taking which took Ireland, save only Cessair.
95. (A) Of the children of Iafeth here now. Iafeth son of Noe and Olivana his wife, they had eight sons, Gomer, Magog, Madai, Iabal or Iavan, [the eldest] , Tubal, Mosoch, Thiras, Maisegda.
(B) As for Gomer, of him are the Galladagdae [= Galatae] , and they are the same as the Galli. Another
name for them is Gallograeci. Why is the seed of Gomer son of Iafeth called ' ' Gallograeci ' ' ? They were fundamentally Galli, says Isidorus : and the ruler of the land called Bithynia gave to the Greeks a portion of his land
for giving him help. They stayed with him to oppose his brethren; and for that reason they are called Gallograeci, because
they were fundamentally in part Greeks, in part Galli; and it will not arise that Gregus was a son of Gomer.
(C) Thessalus son of Gregus built the city called
Thessalonica, and therein he ruled his kingdom. From him is Thessaly named authentically, and Greece is named from his father.
(D) Gomer had four sons, Rifath Scot from whom are the Scots; now he was Ibath son of Gomer, the grandfather of Feinius Farsaid [Feinius Farsaid s. Baath s. Ibath s.
Gomer s. Iafeth]. Why are the Gaedil called Greeks of Scythia, seeing that
fundamentally they are not of the seed of Nemed son of Agnomain? They are of the people of Scythia, for they are of
the seed of Feinius Farrsaid, who had the princedom of Scythia. However, he had not the kingdom of Scythia, but its princedom : and as they are of the progeny of Gomer, the Gaedil are called
Greeks. We find it hard to disconnect them from Gomer on that account.
(E) The three other sons of Gomer were Aschenez, of
whom are the Rhegini, Rifath of whom are the
Paphlagonians, Thogorma of whom are Phrygia and Ilia.

(N) As for Ibath, one of the two sons of Magog, his son
was Alainius. He had three sons, Airmen, Negua, Isicon. Airmen had five sons, Gotus, Uiligotus, Cebitus, Burgandus, Longbardus. Negua had four sons, Vandalus, Saxus, Bogardus, Longbardus.

(Q) Now these are those peoples, to wit the progeny of Iafeth, who took the territory and princedom of all Europe and of the northern side of Asia ; and those are the fifteen chief people of the progeny of Iafeth, with their subordinate
people. And they possessed many territories in Asia,
namely from Mount Amanus and Mount Taurus northward to the river Don, and to Northern Scythia : and they possessed all Europe to the ocean of sea in the west of the island of Britain, and to three-cornered Spain in the south, i.e. the Astures. (?) Of the progeny of Iafeth son of Noe down to this, with their chief peoples and their subordinate
peoples, their takings and their territories, both in Asia and in Europe. 96. As for the three sons of Noe that we have reckoned above, Sem, Ham, Iafeth : before the Flood were those three persons
born. Others say that a son was born to Noe after the Flood, named Ionitus. Ethan was the portion of territory which he received : out of the other three portions was his portion selected.
He was a good astrologer, having learnt it from his father Noe.
97. Coba, wife of Noe, she it is who wove raiment for every one after the Flood.
Eua wife of Adam, she it is who first wove an apron for herself and for Adam, on the third day after coming
from the river Tiber (sic : lege Tigris) after their penance, when God had commanded it to her.
Catafola their daughter, who was born along with Cain,
wife of Pendan son of Adam, she it is who wove raiment before anyone else : about her was the jealousy excited.
Iafeth son of Noe, it is he who first sounded a harp and an organ after the Flood.
Sem, son of Noe, the first smith, the first wright, the first carpenter after the Flood. As for Noe, he began to work husbandly in the first year after
the Flood. He made ploughing and reaping, and planted a vineyard. Ham, son of Noe, first attained to swimming and poetry and bardism. Now when Ham understood thereafter that the Flood should come, and the prophets were foretelling that a destruction of
the progeny of Adam should come, by reason of Cain's kin

one of lime, one of clay, and one of wax. And he wrote upon them the histories of the [antediluvian] age, so that they should endure after the Flood. The columns of lime and of clay were destroyed, and the column of wax remained : and this it was that related the histories of the Age before the Flood, and it survives thereafter.
Oliuana his [Iafeth's] wife, it is she who first fashioned raiment after the Flood.

THE DISPERSAL OF THE NATIONS. 165
of the foregoing book down to this, ut dicit historia.
The island of Ireland is situated in the west; as the
Paradise of Adam is situated on the southern coast of the east, so Ireland is in the northern portion, toward the west. Those lands are as similar by nature, as they are similar by their positions on the earth : for as Paradise hath no noxious beast, so the learned
testify that Ireland hath no serpent, lion, toad,
injurious rat, dragon, scorpion, nor any hurtful beast,
save only the wolf. And so Ireland is called "the island of the west" : "Hyberoc"( 7 in Greek is called "occasum" in Latin; 'nia' or 'nyon' in Greek is called "insula" in Latin. [Now Hibernia is next to the island of Britannia : in extent of territory it is narrower, but in soil it is more fertile. This stretches
northward from Africa, and its foremost parts tend toward Iberia, I that is, Spain j and the Bay of Biscay; whence also Hibernia takes its name. It is called Scotia also, because it is inhabited by the nations of the Scots. Within it is no serpent, rare bird,
nor bees; to such an extent— } not at this time j that if anyone were to scatter in any place amongst
beehives dust or gravel carried from thence, the swarms would desert the honeycombs.] [The Scoti are named from Scota, daughter of Pharao King of Egypt, who was wife of Nelius :
J They are called Feni
from Fenius Farsaid { . The Scots are the same as the Picts, so called from their painted body, j as
though scissi ! , inasmuch as they are marked with an
impression of a variety of devices by means of iron
needles and ink.] Moreover the country is called
Eriu from the heroes. [Let him who readeth
perspire !]

had Adam and Eve together, till a demon of misdeeds (?) reached them, on a Friday.
14. The form of a serpent, a body of thin air, the devil took to himself on the evil course :
the letters through which he made incantation—a
wretched affairwere He, Vav, He, and Yodh.
15. There is the reason—it is familiar
why men say "Left beyond right" :
because it is the crooked left hand that was stretched to the apple.
16. After they had sinned—it was not lawfulthey were cast into the lofty land of Egypt :
A space of three months after the transgression the one palm-tree fed and clothed them.
17. Cain was conceived, it was not long; Abel was conceived and brought to birth ; to withered Cain of the shackle the deed of the curse adhered.

18. They went to offer two rams, Abel, Cain who was not noble ; the King did not consider worthy the offering which Cain brought with him.
19. There came the grace of the brilliance of the King of Suns upon the offering which Abel brought : thence did envy and anger fill sinful Cain of the crooked crafts.
20. Cain took in his savage hand
the guilty jaw-bone of the camel; to Abel he leapt with violence, so that he slew him with a blow.
21. Seth set his hand to the jaw-bone, on seeing the blood of the sin : he is the man without deficiency
upon whom the first beard grew.
22. The learned tell us, the people of wisdom of manifold melody,
that from a long time the stones grow not—„ from the day when Abel's blood suffused them.

(For the explanation of the asterisk see the beginning of R2
.)
1, 1*. Fecit shows that oo R1 worked on an ante-Hierony
man text of Genesis. The Vulgate has creauit, as in R3
fl 20.
The gloss in R1 is of some critical importance. It is absent from T[ 1*, therefore it was not incorporated in the text of *Q.
In LF it appears in the form -\ nl fil . . . . fairseom, to which
F (and L sec. man.) add fein. The version in *X is preserved
in R3
ff 20 ; there we have the older feisin. In LF nd foircend
precedes fairseom, in *X it follows fairseom feisin. Such a shifting about of words is practically diagnostic of the
incorporation of a superscript gloss, therefore nd foircend
must be a further glossarial addition made after the incorporation of the original gloss with the text. The history
of the interpolation was therefore as follows :
(1) The gloss existed, interlined or marginal, in VLF*X*Q in the simple form .i. nl fil tosach fairseom : a
very natural comment—"In the beginning God made ....
(note, that He hath no beginning)."
(2) oo *Q was copied, without the gloss, or at most with it in an interlineation. (3) There must have been a ms. \/LF*X in which the
gloss was incorporated, and to which nd foircend was added
glossarially. (In R3
, these words must have been still interlined in yBMH, for B has them in a different place from
the other two mss. of R3
.)
(4) From this ms. \/LF and *X derive. But as F
generally displays closer affinities with *Q than with L, we
must suppose that L has undergone scribal distortion or
editorial manipulation in deriving from \/LF. If we had
more of *X, we should probably find it nearest to co R1
:
F and *Q must on the whole be good copies of V^F *X *Q,

as they are in close agreement : L is the farthest away from
oo R1
.
2, 2*. Here again we find evidence that *Q represents an older text ; in 2* we have cetumus, olchena, Aendidin as contrasted with chetus, archena, Aine, in 2. Dorigne and the consistent spelling -nd- are also older than doringne and the
spelling -nn-. In these readings F shows a closer affinity to *Q than to L. Soillsi aingel is an attempt at a solution of the old puzzle, as to how light could have been created before the luminaries : see Augustine, Civ. Dei sd. 9. The creation of the angels upon the First Day is usually described in summaries of the Creation such as this : for example, in the Arabic Book of the Rolls .
1 "The Holy First Day, chief of Days : early in it God created the Upper Heaven and the Worlds, and the
highest rank of Angels . . . and the Archangels," etc. So in Isidore, Etym. v. 39 : Prima aetas in exordio sui continet creationem mundi. Primo enim die Deus in lucis nomine condidit angelos. And in the old English Lyff of Adam amd Eve (ed. Horstmann, Sammlung altenglischer Legenden,
p. 220 ff.) : "God as his wille was behihte to make liht : and
bo he made angelus." Firmament. The absence, of the definite article shows that the writer took the word, which he found in his Latin Bible, for a proper name. The reading in F, neam .i. firmamaind, is a misplacement of a gloss, for neam must originally have explained the difficult word firmament, and not vice versa. The gloss must
also have been in *X, for in R3
ff 20, third interpolation, it has displaced firmament altogether. That *X, and not *Q, is the source of this passage is shown by its use of
nem-chrtithaig as against the n-ecliriithach of F* Q. This
excerpt from #X is further instructive, as it shows that all the dates are interpolations. They precede the works in *X, but follow them in the other mss. The original text was
therefore a bald list of the works of creation—' ' He made first the formless mass. He made Firmament. He made Earth and Seas," etc. The names of the days were interlined as

glosses, and taken in at different times and in different places.
They were not securely in the text even in L, for at least three of them have been inserted sec. man. in that MS. After tondaitecha, the words in mora in LF and na fairrge in *Q kill one another. They are both glosses, inserted
independently by readers who knew or discovered for themselves that marine creatures were created on the Fifth Day. It follows almost inevitably that ind deoir and in tahnan are giossarial also. Dia after ro ehumsain is correctly omitted by E ; as it has entered the text before larom in *Q, and after it in
\/LF*X, it is suspect on the principle already set down.
Most likely it remained as 5 till late in the R2 tradition. In the original text, the verb ro chumsain, like dorigni, had no subject expressed.
Oipriugad for foirbthiugad is another mark of affinity
between F and *Q.
1 ni follomnaclit itir may perhaps have been suggested
by the OL text requieuit ab omnibus operibus suis quae
inchoauit Deus facere (cf. LXX,<Lv r/?»s«ro 6 Otoe; Troiijnai) — an implication that the Divine energy continued after the accomplishment of the Creation. As it occurs in F*Q it
must be original, or a very early interpolation ; more probably the latter, as it is absent from *X. T clorad bendachtain foraib in R 2 must have been inserted after the incorporation of the first leaf of # Q with that text.
It is unknown to LF*X, and breaks awkwardly into the sense.
Foraib is almost certainly a copyist's mistake for fair:
he forgot that the blessing was upon the rest-day, not upon the creatures (Gen. ii. 3).
2a (in R2
). A group of three late interpolations (y1
, y2
, y3
),
which (like the gloss at the end of 2* just noticed) entered the *Q tradition independently, after its first leaf had been
separated from the rest of R 1
. The first two were borrowed by yW, but the third was ignored : as 1/R 3 was nothing if
not acquisitive, we infer that *Z, his copy of R 2
, did not contain it. Y 2
, which is a natural pendant of U 2, was the first of the three to make its way into the text : but y 1 y 2 must
both have been no more than marginal notes in # Z, for yW

has inserted y 2 before, not after, the list of the works of Creation, and has taken in y 1 at a different pla.ee (fi 25).
1 a alius is a gloss : it is not found in R3
, and therefore was unknown to *Z. The original purpose of y 2 was to show that Adam was
made from the four elements. A further interpolator has confused this by inserting the specification of the countries
from whose earth Adam was fashioned. YR 3
C\\ 25) has discovered anew the purpose of the passage, and has expressed his discovery by adding the comment is amlaid . . . in gach duini. For parallels to the ideas here expressed as to the materials
from which Adam was made, see Stokes, Three Irish Glossaries
p. xl : idem, Man Octipartite (sic), in R.C., i, p. 261. The
formation of Adam from the four elements is thus described in the Syriac Cave of Treasures :
2 "The angels saw the right hand of God opened out flat and stretched out over the whole world : and all creatures were collected in the palm of His
right hand. And they saw that He took from the whole mass of the earth one grain of dust, and from the whole nature of water one drop of water, and from all the air which is above, one puff of wind, and from the whole nature
of fire a little of its heat and warmth"—and therewith made Adam. In the same work Budige quotes from a Coptic tradition preserved in The Discourse of Abbaton the Angel
of Death, by Timothy, archbishop of Rakoti (Alexandria), to
the effect that the clay of which Adam was made was brought by the angel Muriel "from the land of the East." More
specific but mutually contradictory information is afforded by various Jewish Rabbis on the subject. Eisenmenger3
quotes Rabbi Meir as saying that the dust from which Adam was made was brought together from the whole earth; ingeniously deducing the fact from a combination of Ps. exxxix [Vulgate exxxviii] 16 and 2 Chron. xvi. 9.
Rabbi 'Oshaya declares that the body of the first man came
from Babel, his head from the land of Israel, his limbs from the other countries. Other theories are given in the same place, but none so specific as the version which has reached
the Irish interpolator.

For Garad, Arabia, Lodain, Agoria the homily on
Creation in Lebor Brecc* substitutes Malon, Arton, Biblon,
Agore respectively. I can make nothing of these, unless "Agoria" be a. misreading for "Moria": in some forms of
Irish script capital M is not unlike Ag. Mount Moi-iah is alleged to have been the site of the altars of Solomon, David, Noah, Cain, and Abel as well as of Abraham, and is specified by Maimonides (Beit Abacliria, c. 2) as being the source of
the earth from which Adam was made. According to The
Dialogue of Salomon and Satumus,5 Adam was made of eight pounds weight of materials, which are specified, but here irrelevant.
The same authority agrees with y3 in saying that Adam
was created as at the age of thirty, but the age of Eve is not
specified. According to the Lebor Brecc homily, Adam was created nine months before Eve.
3. 3*. The legend of the Fall of the Angels, here introduced as a necessary preliminary to the Fall of Man, is part of the complicated angel-demon mythology that was absorbed
from Persian sources and developed in post-exilic Judaism : quite likely it has its roots in the myth of the combat of
Marduk and Tiamat, which is the prologue to the Babylonian legend of Creation. Brought to shape by false exegesis of such scattered passages as Isaiah xiv. 12, Luke x. 18, Revelation ix. 1 ff., the story was taken over into early Christian tradition. The first of these passages, foreshadowing the downfall of the King of Babylon, and addressing him
ironically as "Morning Star," has given the name "Lucifer" to the leader of the revolting angels : see Augustine Civ. Dei, xi. 15. The story appears in mast early paraphrases of the Biblical history, as for instance in Saltair na Rann, no. vi, and in the fourteenth century Cursor Mundi.6 None of the
LG texts knows of the second fall of the infernal angels, after the temptation of Eve, referred to in the hymn Alius Prosator, verse G. In both F and L this paragraph is desperately difficult to decipher : impossible indeed, at least for me, without the

help of ultra-violet photographs prepared by Professor Ditchburn. But the page is so badly rubbed, in both mss., that the photographs do not recover the whole text : it is,
however, clear that L here stands by itself, and F and *Q, though not identical, are related. L's reading- looks like a
scribal guess at an illegible passage in \/h. Comparison between the two texts reveals two or three minor inter
polations, indicated by the marks |-|| on the printed page, but not calling for special remark. Imbe in *Q as against
Nime in LF is probably right. I take -\ do Eioa cona chlainn to be a double interpolation. In the original, Lucifer and Adam were in partnership. Then someone, forgetting that
Adam was at the time expected to be a virginal immortal, added cona chlaind. After that someone else slipped in i do Eua, and forgot to make the consequential change cona cclaind. In R2
, do Neimi is anomalous, but it is certainly what it looks like in V. It is very worn and obscure in this place. The "Nine orders" of the Angels are very frequently specified in Apocryphal literature, as in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, xx. I. 7 The following enumeration is
gtiven by Solomon, bishop of Basrah: 8 "The angels are
divided into nine classes and three orders. The upper order
contains Cherubim, Seraphim, and Thrones, and these are the bearers of God's throne : the middle order contains Lords, Powers, and Rulers : the lower order contains Principalities,
Archangels, and Angels." Isidore (Etym, VII. v. 4) gives a similar enumeration, but in a different sequence. [Ro] -diumsach intl Lucifer, though appearing both in *Q and in LF, is probably an early interpolation, seeing that the words of the Almighty are habitually reported in Latin. It is probably nothing more than some reader's personal
opinion on Lucifer's proceedings. The words Venite, etc., are a reminiscence of the sentence
upon the builders of Babel—Venite et confundamus linguam eorum (Gen. xi. 7). The words ut uideamus, imported into

the *Q tradition from the preceding verse 5 of the Babel
narrative, are also found in the quotation from the Babd story in Auraicept na nEces. 9 The Irish translation there given, mutatis mutandis, is identical with that found here

4, I*. That the envy of Satan for his supplanter was the reason for the Temptation and the Fall of Man, is the
usual belief, derived ultimately from that popular apocryphon,
The Book of Adam and Eve. The passage, which it is needless to quote here, will be found in Charles, Apocrypha and PseudepigrapJia, ii, 137. The Irish historian has, however, missed the contrast between the Paradisus spirit uum, from which Lucifer was cast out, and the Paradisus corporum (not
"heaven") which was to have been the portion of Adam:
even the glossators in R3 overlooked this, though they could have learnt of it from Comestor, Historia Scholastica, chap. xxi. Our text knows nothing of the refusal of Lucifer to
do homage to Adam : a very common incident in Creation storias. It is related in the Lebor Brecc Homily. Dohiid Iofer Niger. The subject of the verb must originally have been Lucifer, carried through from the preceding sentence. "Iofer Niger" is beyond question an
intrusive gloss, written in by someone fresh from reading the
Life of the fourth-century St. Juliana. 10 The name is there given as an alternative for Belial son of Beelzebub, totius mali inuentor •. but so far as I have been able to find out for
myself, or through enquiries which the Rev. P. Grosjean, S.J.,
has most kindly made on my behalf, the name does not appear to be recorded in any other text. Bespelled by Juliana, this being is compelled to confess his own misdeeds, the first of
which is Ego sum qui feci Adam et Euam in Paradiso praeuaricari 103- The editors of Acta Sanctorum quote variant
forms—Iophin, Iofet, Iofen, Tophet, and they suggest an
(improbable) etymology (Hebrew -^ntT- sahor, " black ").

The relevant passage is quoted in the glosses to Feilire Oengusso t
11 the name there appears as Iafer, Iofer, and (in Labor Brecc) Ethiar. Of all these forms, "Tophet" is the
most comprehensible, but is not on that account necessarily
the most authentic. The critical history of this interpolation usefully supplements that of the gloss in fl 1. It was absent
from *X, as will be seen by reference to ft 31 : R3 cannot have taken this from *Z, because that MS., being dependent for its opening words upon *Q, would have included the demon's name. It is also absent from F, which here shows itself
earlier in tradition even than *Q. In L it has become
distorted by corruption : the form there found, Iarngir, may
be compared with Ifirnaig, the form which the name has assumed in the Irish text of Vita Iulianae (R.C., xxxiii, p. 316) under the influence of the word Ifernd.
The occasional superiority of F and *X to *Q is further illustrated in this ]\ ; *Q contains two other interpolations, not in *XF. I ffochraic do is an attempt to fill in what someone took for a lacuna after dobertha; and co curp seim
is a cheville borrowed from Poem V, line 93. The detached part of this paragraph, which follows If 5a
in R 2
, contains an unintelligible expression q cenn fri cotlud. Though a guesswork rendering for it is offered in the trans
lation, I suspect tha.t it is really nothing but an early misreading of cen forcend, "without end."
5, 5*. This If was no part of oo R 1
. It must have been a marginal gloss in yR1
; it was taken into the text before the words Conid aire sin, etc. in *Q, and after them in VLF*X. Moreover, the differences between the texts in the two traditions cannot be explained except on the
assumption that when it was in the marginal- gloss stage it was in Latin throughout, and that what we have are two
independent attempts at a translation. The renderings into Irish of the words of the Deity are later still. Those in *Q
are obviously quite independent of those in LF.
On the whole the texts are Old Latin. Terra es et in terrain ibis is OL : Vulg. has Puluis es et in puluerem ibis.

Sabatier in his notes quotes an identical version from
Hieronymus In Isaiam. The OL of the third quotation is Multiplieans multiplicabo tristitias tuas et gemitum tuum; in tristitiis paries filios. VuLg. has Multiplicabo aerumnas tuas et conceptus tuas; in dolore paries filios. It is worth passing notice that the biblical order of the three texts is reversed. Almost certainly the original glossator quoted them from memory.
We note as a contribution to the genealogy of the mss. that the unauthorized addition et filias tuas is omitted in F, inserted without translation in L, and inserted with translation
in *Q. We have no excerpt from *X at this point, so we do not know what was in that MS. Sasam in E1 may also be read sasad, in the obscurity of
the page.
5a. (in E 2
). I cannot find the reading Ecce os in any of the Latin versions, but it is presupposed by all the redactions. 75 cuma, which is absent from E, does not seem to make any reasonable sense : the suggested translation is a mere makeshift. I suspect that the words have no glossarial or other connexion with the text at all ; that they were originally
a marginal scribble conveying a surreptitious communication from one student to another on some subject of transient
interest—' ' Never mind "
; "It doesn 't matter. ' '
In cliet-gliaire, here adopted from P as against VE, is certainly right : the gloss was clearly suggested by line 84 of the poem no. V. The change to choibclie is arbitrary,
made by someone who did not understand the original reading. It is obvious that this ff is an interpolation, quite
irrespective of its absence from E1
. It makes the creation of Eve follow the Fall !
6. This paragraph is the most difficult to read of the whole obscure first page of L. Here again *Q gives a better text, though there are several interpolations, especially the alternative version of the death of Abel. There are numerous speculations as to the instrument of
Abel's murder. The Book of Adam and Eve does not enlighten us. Tlie Book of the Rolls says that a sharp



NOTES ON SECTION I. 209
stone was used. In the Old English versions, it is commonly
said that the instrument was an ass-bone : thus, in the Lyff of
Adam and Eve we read "wib be eheke-bon of an asse he smot
him on be hed"; and in Cursor Mundi (1073) we are told
Wit the chafte ban of a ded has Men sais bat bar wit slan he was.
This was presumably suggested by the exploit of Samson against the Philistines. Saltair na Rann, which follows The
Book of Adam and Eve, has nothing to say on the subject : and there does not appear to be any authority for the idea that a camel-bone was used. Did the old Irish historians fully comprehend the difference between an ass and a camel? In Cashel Cathedral there is a quaint carving of an elephant, of a much later date, which reveals a very rudimentary conception of the appearance of an exotic animal : and as in ancient Ireland the camel and the ass were equally
unfamiliar, 12 it is quite possible that they were supposed to be similar or identical. "Lasin enaim chamaill" is the best that I can make of the faint traces in L. It seems to be different from the do lecain chamaill of R2 and the fid chnama of FR3 (§ 87). The
version of this para-graph in F is glossarial, and has ousted its lemma : the original form (with some, minor verbal
variations) is preserved by L*Q. The F version has been
written after R2 attained its present form, in which the Flood is sta,ted to be a punishment for the murder of Abel. One
of the glossators of R 3 has copied it in ff 87, directly from F
or perhaps V^ ; this late and corrupt version cannot come
from the early MS. *X, which is the source of most of the R1
glosses in R3
.
Fo intamail marbtha na n-idbart is a gloss which has come

corrupt. Mac Adaim has become imorro : aireagda ro bdi ac
has dropped out, almost certainly by oversight of a cor fa chasdn (these words are in a cor fa chasm in F) 13
: aoca rribdi eland is a gloss. In these respects F follows *Q exactly. The genealogy breaks the sense awkwardly, and is doubtless an
early interpolation : it appears in all three mss. Most likely it was first written by an annotator in the margin. The
second interpolation of L is not in F, which substitutes the Imroimadar .... Olibana also found at the end of fl 88.
The remainder of the text of this part of R1 is
genealogical, giving the following particulars
(i) Seth to Noah, a genealogy at first assumed rather than
expressed, but early interpolated into ff 7. (ii) The three sons of Noah, with their inheritances (IT 8).
(iii) The sons of Japhet (fl 9). (iv) The descendants in Ireland of Magog son of Japhet (IT 10). Everything outside this brief scheme may be taken
as interpolated matter.
Acca mbai claind, shown by its absence from F*Q to be
glossarial in the L tradition, is interesting, as it proves the
acquaintance of a glossator in that tradition with poem no. V (see line 185 of that poem). There are two quatrains from
this poem quoted in R1
, from a version widely different from
that which appears in R2
, R3
.
In tAdam tanisi has grown out of a. confused and inaccurate recollection of 1 Corinthians xv. 45.
The second interpolation is otiose, as it merely repeats
what has gone before. F has a different interpolation here,
which must come from a MS. of R2
(IT 10, H) : #R3 has copied
it, like the preceding paragraph, from F or from \/F. Note that the discovery that the wives of Noah and his sons were
their respective sisters had not been made when the MS. of R2 used by g¥ was written. Also note that the expression na
hairci sin, which appears in the L interpolation, postulates a previous mention of the Ark which, in fact, does not occur in the present context.

NOTES ON SECTION I. 211
The almost complete absence of the Flood story from R1
contrasts notably with the emphasis laid upon it in R2
, R3
,
and is one of several indications of the primitive simplicity of that text. The names of the women of Noah 's family were themes for endless vain speculation. According to The Book of Jubilees Noah's wife was called 'Enrzara, and the wives of his
sons were respectively Sedeqetelebab, Ne'elatama'uk, and 'Adatan 'eses. Various Jewish and other apocryphal
authorities name Noah's wife Noria, Noema, Bath-Enos, Tithea, and Haical; Eutychus names Salit, Nahlat, Arisisah as the wives of his sons. 14 The poem Athair caicli gives Cata Rechta, Cata Chasta, Cata Flauia as the sons' wives (quatrain 39). Olla, here named as Shem's wife, there becomes the wife
of Seth. Cbmestor gives similar names—Phuarpara for Noah's wife, and Pharphia, Cataflua, Fliva as the sons' wives. Cata Flauia or Cata Flua, expanded into Cata
Folofia, appears in the compilation known as Bansenchus as
the wife of Cain—confusion between Cain and Cam or Ham
is not infrequent—as we may see in the Book of Leinster facsimile 136 b 32. In the Dialogue of Salomon and Saturnus15 this tradition is combined with that in the text
before us. Noah 's wife is there called Dalila : those of Ham
and Japhet are respectively Jatarecta and Catanuuia, but, the author adds, "by other names are they named, Olla, Ollina, and Ollibana." Shem's wife does not appear : indeed, Shem himself has become the wood of which the ark was made. In the fifteenth century Master of Oxford's Catechism the omission was rectified: Noah's wife is called Dalida, and the sons' wives are Cateslinna, Laterecta, and Aurca, otherwise Ollia, Olina, Olybana. 16 In the Pseudo-Berossus of

worth—we read how "Noah taught astronomy, division of time, and astrological predictions, and he was considered as being of divine origin : therefore was he called Olybama and
Arsa, which mean 'heaven' and 'sun' wherefore the Scythians of Armenia have towns Olybama and Arsa Rath a
and the like. ' m In the Caedmon GenesisTM the names of these
women are given as Percoba, Olla, Oliua, Olliuani. Gollancz, in his introduction to the sumptuous facsimile of the
Caedmon ms., 19 considers that the passage containing these names is an interpolation, on the ground that elsewhere the
ms. closely follows the Biblical text. He suggests that they have been picked out more or less at random from some Onomasticon of Biblical names, in which Aholah, Aholibah, Aliolibamah (Vulgate Oolla, Ooliba, Oolibama) occurred together. This is quite admissible, assuming the early existence (and local availability) of such an Onomasticon; but the compiler can hardly have taken the trouble to look up the unsavoury connexion in which the first two
of these names are found (Ezekiel xxiii). His suggestion that Percoba is a corruption of "Berseba" seems, perhaps, less happy. Percoba figures in Bansenclius along with her daughters-in-law, thus characterized {Book of Leinster facs.

Noah" who burnt the Ark while it was a -building. This is irrelevant here : but it may not be a mere accidental coincidence that he makes reference immediately afterwards to a certain prophet, one Barkabba, whose name he describes as suitable,

wives of Adam's other married sons (cf. Poem V, line 188).
8. The *Q version of this ff, much farced with glosses and
interpolations, appears in R3
, partitioned between ]} 89 ad fin. and H 92. Its principal contribution to criticism is the close relationship which once more it shows between that ms. and F, as both have a glossarial addition correcting the number
of the sons of Shem (but in different words). On the other hand it does not show some careless omissions of F. The world was supposed, on the basis of the data supplied in Genesis x, to have been divided into 72 nations or linguistic
groups : see for instance Isidore, Etym. IX ii. The total of
30 + 30 + 15 is 75, which is three too many : the glossarial note just referred to corrects this. The names of Shem's sons here specified are the first three of those enumerated in Gen. x. 22. It is not clear why they should be reversed in order. "Persius" corresponds to the Biblical Elam. CUsh and Canaan are the first and last of the sons of
Ham enumerated in Gen. x. 6. The sons of Japhet are more disguised. Dannai presumably means Dodanim (recte Rodanim) at the end of the
list in Gen. x. 4. Gregus no doubt is the same as Javan
(= Ionians). Hispmnius is Tarshish, the leading town in Southern Spain. This, like "Dodanim," appears in
Gen. x. 4 as a. son, not of Japhet, but of his son Javan. The
equation Gomerus = the Biblical Gomer needs no comment.

9. The *Q version of this ff appears is R3
, partitioned, owing to later interpolation, between fl 94 and U 98. It
became the common property of early historians, and appears also in Sex Aetates Mundi, from which another version of it has entered the text of H, in the long- extract from Sex Aetates which forms oar fl 95. It is also found in Nennius. Leaving
for the moment the general question of the text and its origin, let us concentrate our attention upon the LG- version, as it
appears in LF*Q. It is unknown to R2
. The irrelevance of the passage to the main purpose of LG shows that it can be no part of the original text : but as it appears in *Q it must have been an early interpolation. The oldest form of it, however, happens to be preserved by a late interpolation
in H (fi 93) : Iathfeth dono viae Nde, is uad tuaiscert-leth na Haissia -\ luclit na Heorpa wile. This must derive from a
tradition earlier than the extant R 1 texts : in these, the
obviously glossarial A. Aissia Becc, Airmen, -\ Fir na Scithia had already become incorporated after Haissia, making it
necessary to repeat is uad before luclit. L makes the further addition of Media, and corrupts tuaiscert-leth to slor-deise.
"Mac Nde" was probably also glossarial, and I suspect that
it was still interlined when oo R 3 dealt with the text : it does
not appear in H in the "full-dress" form in which we find the
passage in fl 94, though BM both contain it. I take it that these words, and the preceding quatrain
(Triclia mac mm) were set out in \/HMB as follows:
Jdjre^fru<xvuiAifcz:t ijdfatfp2udiffabccdpwn 1 p/i vjlSckiai
IfuAtn gcbcol^TMM&x
To the margin of this MS. someone added against these words is iad a cland-sem lenfamaid, which appeal's in all three
derivatives. M, and B as presented by its eighteenth-century
copyists, follow the text with this addition, and display no
more than unimportant orthographical variations. But coH
started a vicious tradition by overlooking the words in the
cor fa chasdn (line 2 of the above figure) at the end of the



NOTES ON SECTION I. 215
quatrain. He proceeded from the quatrain to line 3 ; thence, misled by the continuity of the sense, to line 4; and did not notice the omitted words till he came to Alaxandrach. So he inserted them in his transcript at the place which he had reached, allowing the repetition of the words is Had .... Alax. to remain, to save himself the trouble of making
erasures. As he wrote Greg Beg .... Greg Mor in the first of these repetitions (ff 94) and reversed the order in the second (ff 98) it follows that the scribe of his exemplar
(VHMB) must have accidentally omitted Greg Mor, and
inserted it as an interlined correction. Large interpolations
were subsequently made piecemeal in the H tradition—fl 93 after the quatrain, and fflj 95-97 before Grecus mac Iafeth.
From this point onward the two texts, R1 and *Q, are virtually identical, and we need notice no more than that *Q justifies the insertion of mac after Hisicon imorro in tres,
where L has left it out. Taking now the paragraph in detail : the first few lines,
and probably the only original part of the paragraph, enumerate the peoples descended from Japhet in Western Asia and Europe. The first interpolation enlarges on these details, assigning various peoples to the sons of Japhet from whom they are descended. These sons are the same as those
enumerated above, in ]\ 8, excluding "Dannai, " who is here disregarded. Grecus and Essbdinus correspond to the Biblical Javan and Tubal. Isidore helps us to link them together : "Iauan a quo Tones qui et Graeci, Thubal a quo Iberi, qui et Hispanic Gomer, according to Isidore (loc. tit.), is the ancestor of the Galatae or Galli, so it is natural to affiliate to him two personages, Emoth and Ibath, who are in the traditional Teutonic and Celtic ancestry respectively; even although these have no warrant either in Genesis or in Isidore. The important son Magog does not appear : but
that is because the following interpolations have divorced him from his context. Properly speaking, fl 10 should follow on
immediately after the first interpolation, to which it belongs. The second interpolation is an Irish version of the
Frankish "Table of Nations," published first by Grimm, 24

and afterwards, with a much more extensive apparatus
criticus, by Miillenhoff. 25 This document must date from
about the year 520, as Miillenhoff has shown—basing- his
conclusions on the names included and (what is equally
important) omitted. The genealogy starts from the statement for which Tacitus is our oldest authority, 26 that the god Tuisto
bad a son Mannus, from whose three sons are descended the three branches of the Germans, the Herminones, the Istaevones,
and the Ingaevones. The Frankish Table gives eponymous
names, Erminius, Inguo, Istio, clearly postulated to explain
the names in Tacitus : and these are the Armen, Negna, and
Isicon of the Irish version. Two mss. of the Frankish Table give Alanus or Alaneus as the father of these three eponyms.
These mss. (E and F in Miillenhoff s enumeration) appear from the forms which the names assume to be of Irish origin. In the others, the parentage of the three brothers is not specified, though Alanus appears in the document as "the
first king of Rome"! In "Alanus" Grimm recognized long ago a miswriting for the "Mannus" of Tacitus. To Erminius the Frankish Table assigns the Goths, the Walagoths or Goths of Italy, the Vandals, the Gepidae, and the Saxons : to Inguo, the Burgnndians, Thuringians, Langobardi, and Baioarii or Bavarians, who a,re here referred to in literature for the first time. This distribution somehow became disjointed when the document reached Ireland. There, in Sex Aetates Mundi (see Booh of Ballymote, p. 3 of
facsimile a 50, also LG H 95 N) ; in LG, in the present
paragraph ; in the Reichenau ms. of the Table, lettered F in
Miillenhoff 's edition; and in Nennius, who has certainly derived his copy from an Irish source ; the Burgnndians and
Langobardi are transferred to "Airmen" or Erminius, and the Vandals given to "Negua" or Ingno in exchange. All the
versions agiree in assigning: Romanus, Britones, Francus, and
Alamannus—the Romans of Central Gaul, Britons (of
Brittany), Franks, and Alemanni, the four peoples who in
or about the time when the table was drawn up were under the domination of the Frankish Kingi Chlodwig) to Istio or

Isacon, the third of the three brothers. (Naturally Romanus, Francus, etc., in the Irish text are to be regarded as
representing Latin accusative plurals.) The table also appears in Sex Aetates Mundi and in Nennius ; the latter version, as Zimmer has shown27 must have been taken from an Irish source. But we ca,nnot follow Zimmer in concluding that that source must have been either
LG or Sex Aetates—Zimmer prefers the former hypothesis. In fact, all three compilations must have borrowed it from some common source unknown ; for all three treat the
genealogy differently. LG- links it on to Gomer, son of
Noah : Sex Aetates to Magog : and Nennius to Javan. The last named gives us a long genealogy, back to the antediluvian
patriarchs, impinging in one or two places only on the much
shorter pedigree in R1
: we find Nennius 's version, however,
in another connexion, in R2 (see below, ^ 16).
The peculiar pendant which is found in LG only, must
be an addition by some philomath within the LG tradition
itself. "Albanus" should of course be "Alemanus": the
miswriting is a very simple matter. Our glossator thought of "Alba," and associated "Britus" with Britain (instead of Brittany). So he seemingly invented this story of the Britons having driven out the "Albans" across the English Channel, in order to secure the monopoly of the Island of
Britain ; and he seeks to account for similar ethnic names on
the continent—Albanians, Alba Longa, or what not—as the result of this manoeuvre. Sex Aetates has something similar, in saying that from Albanus come the "Albanians of Asia." 28

As has already been noted, this paragraph is properly a
continuation of the first interpolation in fl 9. The names in the form in which they appear here, from F, are very
corrupt.
Tancatar Erinn, in which the verb of motion is used without a preposition, is a favourite construction in this text, and may possibly indicate the influence of a text originally in Latin \ as in Vergil's Italiam uenit).

11. This fl hints that in the original form of R2 there was an antecedent in which the unions of Sethites and Cainites were denounced. It is more fully preserved in R3
, to which we may postpone the discussion of the subject. The three sentences, in which a singular conception of the family of
Noah is suggested, are clearly glossarial interpolations. They
have made no impression on R3—except in the late MS. M, at fl 188, where the idea, implied is referred to. It is probably inspired partly by a desire to draw an exact analog}- between
the households of Adam and of Noah, partly to insinuate that only by such irregular unions could the contamination of Cainite blood be avoided. I have found no authority for it
in apocryphal or pseudepigraphic literature. The Syriac Cave
of Treasures says that Noah married Haykel d. Namus d. Enoch, brother (sic) of Methuselah. 283- It is referred to (probably borrowed from the text before us) by the compiler of the prose version of Bansenchus. The statement that the Flood was a penalty for the crime of Cain has here arisen fortuitously, owing to the accidental
juxtaposition of ff 6 from *Q and fi 11 from R2
. It is possible to find it elsewhere in Apocrypha 5 thus The Book of the
Rolls, to give but one example, makes Adam prophesy to Seth in these words : Know, my son, that there must come a Flood to wash all the earth, on account of the children of Cain, the wicked man who slew his brother. But this is not really parallel : the Flood is here a punishment for the children of Cain [and their union with the Sethites] not for the crime of Cain.
12. Here we have definite proof of what we suspected
in the preceding paragraph : that the Flood, according to
R
2 in its original form, was the penalty for the sinful marriages of Sethites and Cainites, and not for the crime of
Cain itself, as the text, in its present form suggests. The theory is based upon a misinterpretation of Genesis vi. 1, 2.

eh. x, for a marriage between Noah and Enoch's daughter: I cannot find this in Charles "s translation.



NOTES ON SECTION I. 219
The copyists of R2 have here and there made a bad muddle of the story : conspicuously so in this paragraph, especially in the laboured arithmetical disquisition inserted at the end. The account of the Flood was developed by the copyists of
the R2 tradition : the R1 copyists took little interest in it.
The R2 version has carelessly admitted certain discrepancies
with the biblical history. The forty days of downpour, and the 600 years of Noah's life, come from Genesis vii. 12, 11. That there were "three pairs" of clean beasts is a lapse of memory : no sechta is a reader's correction. The month of May is named in the Irish text : the Hebrew and all the
versions say "the second month. " On the hypothesis that the Creation took place at the Vernal Equinox, April would be the first complete month, and so May would be the second.
That the biblical months were lunar was hidden from the
compilers. The date (seventeenth) agrees with Heb. and
Latin: LXX : has "twenty-seventh." A careless glossator seems to have misread the date as "seventh," and to have rushed in with the information that the embarkation took place on the nones (seventh) of May. I take the sentence beginning In tan tarnaic to be a gloss, as it breaks the sense : deda do inglan, etc., is a further gloss upon that : and no sechta is an additional gloss. Lower down, t cona ingenaib
is obviously iglossarial, as it is superfluous before seitcliib, and indeed makes nonsense. "Twelve cubits," which is given by all mss. for the height of the water level above the loftiest mountain-tops, is an error : the biblical text in all versions says ' '
fifteen,
' ' and (later in the fl) E and P have given the correct figure. So, apparently, did \/ V, as is suggested by the form cub ait for
cubat. Early in the history of the text—or even in the
history of the document from which the R2 compilers derived
their information—.xii. must have been misread and miswritten for .xu., as often happens. It is indeed possible to
read .xu., as the number is written, in both V and E ; but inadmissible, as it dislocates the arithmetic of the following interpolation. The Ark, we are told, drew ten cubits (there is no biblical warrant for this) : its keel was two cubits above the highest summit : therefore the water-level was twelve cubits above them. This note further contradicts the orthodox



220 NOTES ON SECTION I.
version of the height of the Ark (30 cubits, Gen. vi. 15) : ten cubits below water and fifteen above make only twenty-five. Something- has been lost from the sentence, .xii. cub at diu
uas na sltibtib aid airdiu : I suggest diu < don usee > uas, which would be an easy haplography.
13. The irrelevance about Enoch and Fintan is clearly a reader's note. Of the latter we shall hear more on a later page. On the legend that Enoch is reserved to fight against Antichrist, along with Elijah (and even to perish in the fighting), see Revue celtique, xxvi, pp. 164-5, and references there.
14. The waters began to dry after 150 days (Gen. viii. 3), but the Ark was floating for 7 months 27 days (Gen. viii. 4,
LXX and Vulg. : Hebrew says 17 days). The waters con
tinued to dry until the tenth month (Gen. viii. 5). An early loss by homoiotes at this point has affected all the mss. :
before dechmud miss we must supply the words dechmad miss : i ccet 16 don. The raven was sent out after 40 days (Gen. viii. 6, all versions) : the 47 of the Irish text is a mistake. There is no Biblical warrant for sending forth the dove on the following day : it is derived from b-rriaw avrtw
(LXX) or post eum (Vulg.) which represent a Hebrew
original meaning from him (i.e. from Noah). The seven days' intervals of the missions of the dove follow the Biblical story.
15. The date of the exodus from the Ark, in all the Biblical versions, is given as "The twenty-seventh day of the
second month" (Gen. viii. 14). For pridnoin Mai must be due to the same glossator as the author of the similar gloss in fl 12, who believed that the voyage occupied exactly a solar year, which, in fact, was approximately true.
The passage tossuch . . . oclit ccetaib is an interpolation,
as it breaks the sense. It must come from some historical treatise (not Sex Aetates Mundi, but resembling it). The
opening words are clearly a. chapter heading. The
double article na Jideisse in domain may be accounted for by
"age-of-the-world" having come to be regarded as an
indivisible technical term. The figures are not accurate : the Hebrew reckoning should be 390, not 292; the Septuagint



NOTES ON SECTION I. 221
reckoning 1170, not 842. (See the table in Skinner's
Commentary on Genesis, p. 233.) The statement that Noah's altar was the first built after the Flood is preceded by the mark .i., which is usually
diagnostic of an interpolated gloss. The passage anmand mac Noe to the end of the annexed poem is also no part of the original text. It likewise interrupts the sense, which is a description of the divisions of the world : and it gives names for the wives of Noah's sons not in accordance with the tradition followed by R2
. This tradition is summed up in poem V, and if the original redactor had named these women, he would presumably have followed its lead. See note on ff 7. The last sentence is a relic of the original abstract of the Biblical history, rendered obsolete by the elaborate genealogical matter which has been superposed upon it.
16. Riphath, to whom the pedigree in this paragraph is traced, comes from Gen. x. 3. The original meaning of the name is obscure : in 1 Chron. i. 6 it appears as "Diphath," the discrepancy being due to the similarity of the characters for
D and R in both the older and the later Hebrew scripts. The addition "Scot" has of course no Biblical warrant, but conceivably it has arisen from some copy of the Latin version
in which the name was given as Riphaz or Rifatz (as in two of the mss. on which the Vatican variorum edition is based). The z we may suppose to have become separated from the
rest of the name, resolved into sc or st, and then expanded into "Scot." The genealogy is obviously quite different from that given
in R1
: but it is of equal if not greater antiquity, for it was in the document used by Nennius. The ancestry of ''Alanius" as given by Nennius is practically identical with that before us. See fl 9 above. The interpolation at the end is an attack on an opinion,
presumably held by many men of learning at the time, but
now of insignificant importance! But it illustrates the difficulty which the compilers had, in reducing their chaotic materials to order.
17. We have here the first of the Synchronistic disquisi
tions, chiefly founded upon the Chronicle of Eusebius, which



222 NOTES ON SECTION I.
form an important but probably intrusive element in R2
, R3
.
The figures of Eusebius are not correctly reproduced. He allows only 853 years between the beginning of the reign of
Ninas and the end of that of Tautanes (the Tutanes of our
text) : whereas R2 has 874. As for Tautanes, we must take
him as we find him. It has proved impossible to reconcile
the names of Mesopotamian kings, derived by Eusebius from
Berossus, with the names recovered from the monuments. The interpolator in this paragraph reckons 40 years from
the Tower to Feinius Farsaid : he must therefore be a different person from the author of the otherwise very similar inter
polation in If 16, who makes Feinius the sixteenth in descent from Rifath of the Tower. If 17 allows two years from Feinius to Ninus, and from
Eusebius we learn to consider Ninus a contemporary of
Abraham. But we have already seen that on the lowest estimate there were 292 years from the Flood to Abraham : a long period must therefore be assumed from the Flood to
the Tower, to be bridged by three generations only—Japhet, Gomer, Rifath. The animadversion on the Auraicept is a fatuity : on referring to that text (ed. Calder, line 126) we find that the Latinus of the Tower was quite a different person from Latinus son of Faunus.
18. "Cincris" is the Akenkheres of Eusebius, the Smenkli-ka-ra of modern Egyptology. He is of no importance
in Egyptian history : a mere ghost-king who reigned for a
brief space c. 1360 B.C. immediately before the now famous
Tutankhamun. The glossarial addition, explaining the name of Scota, has arisen from a later passage in the same redaction
(see vol. ii, If 129, and note thereon). It was primarily an attempt to explain the relation of Scota II, daughter of Nectanebus, to the name "Scota," and to differentiate her from Scota I, daughter of "Cincris," who is the person before us at the moment.
Dobreath a ingen is in all the mss., and in the R3 appropriations of the text. It should be dobretha a ingen,

Third Redaction.
At the beginning of the text in B is written in an eighteenth-century hand "Accounts partly authentic and partly fabulous of the first Inhabitant (sic) of Ireland." At
the top of the first page in M is written in a hand con
temporary with the text An toibrechan selaithi annso sis. This has been partly cut through by a bookbinder, and is in consequence not perfectly easy to make out.
20. The gloss ism Mac, which has entered the text of M
as an interpretation of ar tils or in principio (critical note no. 5), is an exegesis as old as Irenaeus, who saw what he presumably thought was the Hebrew word bar, "son" (it is really Aramaic), in the opening words of Genesis, B'reshith bard, "In the beginning of creating." 29 The Irish annotator probably borrowed the idea from Petrus Comestor, whose influence is obvious throughout the glosses
in R3
: Verbum erat principiuni in quo et per quod Pater
creauit mundum . . . Creatus autem est in principio, id est, in Filio. 30 With regard to the interpolations, we have seen above
(note to ff 2a) that y2 does not come from *Q, the ms. of R1
used by oo R3
, nor from *X, the ms. of R1 used by yW, but
from *Z, the ms. of R2 used by y~R3
, in which ms. it was still
a recent interpolation in the margin. Y3 comes from #X.
That it was added later than the others is shown by the
reversal of the blocks of material, for the matter of y3
precedes y 2 in R 2
. The first interpolator knew that the Creation was fully described in the following text : the second
interpolator rushed in where his predecessor had thought it
at least unnecessary to tread. The following differences

224 NOTES ON SECTION I.
between this passage and its cognates in the other mss. are noteworthy :
(i) The statements are inverted, each day being named before its work. (The significance of this has already been pointed out in the notes to ft 2.) (ii) The rn.onth-da.tes are inserted (possibly a still later
interpolation).
(iii) Adam is mentioned before the beasts in the sixth day's work. (iv) There are some differences of Vocabulary : neam for firmament (on which see note to ft 2). "muir" ina timchell, reltcmda for renna, anmanda muiridi for
tondaitecliu. A few passages have all the appearance of intrusive glosses, and are marked as such in the text.
The date assigned to the beginning of Creation—fifteenth
of the Kalends of April, i.e., 18th March—is obviously determined by the Vernal Equinox. The completed Universe is set upon its course on that day, the natural beginning of
the year, solar and agricultural. Though not stated, it is
presupposed by the Flood story in K 2
: see note to ft 12. With the description of the Matter of Creation compare the
following, from Cursor Mundi (1. 348) :
The mater first ther of he mad, That es the elementes to sai, That first scapless al samen lay . . . This elementz that al thinges bindes, Four er thai als elerkes fhides, The nethermast es watur and erth, The thrid es air, and fir the ferth.
The gloss ni locdacht, etc., may be borrowed from some commentary or homily, though I have not succeeded in tracing its origin. But it reads more like the interpolation of a copyist, anxious to reassure himself that the transcription of the words which he has just written down did not constitute an act of unpardonable sin. If this were so, we must assume that the major interpolations had already established them
selves in the text, concealing from the writer the fact that he was dealing with a text which had scriptural warrant.



NOTES ON SECTION I. 225
21. It is important, as will appear presently, to note that
the words dropped by homoiotes in B (-] fodlad na n-usci) contain 14 letters.
The subject of ro fogail may be either Dla or firmamintprobably the latter, as it carries on the command "let it divide ... it divided. ' ' The ambiguity exists even in Heb. :
LXX has removed it by inserting 6 0e6g. The Irish translator is not quite emancipated from the idea of his predecessors responsible for R,1
, R2
, that firmamentum is a proper noun,
and does not require the article.
22. Here there is another haplography in B, caused by the homoiotes of clcmdaiged. The mistake existed in \/B ; for sB has observed the gap in the sense, and has inserted a full stop after the clcmdaiged which has survived. His intelligence did not, however, carry him to the further step of realising that he was copying a biblical text, so that had he chosen he could have filled the lacuna by referring to a copy of the book of Genesis, and translating the equivalent of the missing words.
Note that 43 letters are lost, practically the exact triple of the loss noted in the preceding U : this indicates (i) that "X^B was written in narrow columns of short lines, with an average of 15 letters to the line, and (ii) that some of the carelessnesses for which the Book of Ballymote is notorious must be laid to the account of the exemplar from which it
is copied.
23. In grein, ind csca, which have no authority in any version of the biblical text, are evidently old glosses, inter
lined in VBMH and incorporated with the text after the
separation of the B, M (and H) traditions, in different relative contexts.
24. BamimdaigMer is an illustration of the use of the
possessive pronouns to supply the place of the missing first
and second persons of the passive : but it is probably an
artificial archaism in this place. One distinguished Celtist to whom I showed it called it "a monstrosity."

verse 24, may have been intentional ; but Tr. is on the whole too conscientious for this, and it is more likely a piece of carelessness or laziness on the part of a copyist.
On the interpolation, see notes to 1J 2a.
27. This paragraph begins the J-source of the Hebrew Genesis. Although Comestor calls special attention to the
critically important word Dominus, which here begins to
appear in the Divine name—adding an exegesis with which
we need not trouble ourselves—the glossators have not shown any special interest in it ; nor has the Irish translator made any endeavour to maintain the distinction, which is found in the Hebrew and -all ancient versions. The story of the finding of a name for Adam, contained
in the long interpolation at the end of the paragraph, appears first in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, written in Egypt somewhere about the beginning of the Christian Era, and brought to its final form by a Hellenistic Jew. 31 It survives to-day in a Slavonic version only : but in its time it had a considerable influence upon Early Christian literature. In
chap. xxx. v. 13 ff. we read: And I [God] appointed him [Adam] a name, from the four component parts, from east,
from west, from south, from north, and I appointed for him four special stars, and I called his name Adam. Charles cites parallels from The Sibylline Oracles (iii. 24-6) ; PseudoCyprian, Be Montibus Sina et Syon iv; Bede, Exposition of
Genesis, iv; which in one form or another narrate the same
story; others might be added. In Cursor Mundi we read
(line 592)

of the angels, which, however, appears in the Old English
Lyff of Adam and Eue : this text gives us the closest parallel
to the Irish version

The Rivers of Paradise were a favourite subject for speculation : it is therefore not surprising to find, this paragraph farced with glosses. The conceptions that lie behind
them are set forth most simply in Cursor Mundi (line 1032)
Midward that land [Paradise] a wel springes, That remies out with four strandes,
Flummes farand in fer landes . . . The first es Tigre and sithen Gyon, 32 Sithen Eufrates and Fison.
Some hints at the characters attributed to the Rivers of Paradise are given by Comestor (borrowing from Isidore XIII. xxi, 7). Unas dictus est Phison, qui a Gangaro rege Indiae dictus est Ganges . . . Tigris animal est uelocissimum,
et ideo fluuius a sui uelocitate tigridi equiuocatus est . . .
Euphrates frugifer uel fructuosus. Z2a- The Master of Oxford's
Catechism comes close to the statements in Poem no. VI :
"Whate hight the iiij waters that renneth through
Paradise?—The one hight Fyson, the other Egeon, the iijde Tygrys and the iiijth Effraton. Thise be milke, hony, oyll. and wyne."
There is a similar passage in Salomon and Saturnus. These ideas are forced, in Christian tradition, into an analogy between the four streams and the four evangelists : Cursor Mundi at line 21,293, likens the words of the Evangelists to
water, wine, milk, and honey respectively. They are, however, of Jewish origin. Rabbi Yehosha ben Levi is quoted in Yalkut Shimoni as saying, in the course of a description of the
terrestrial paradise, "And there flow out from it four rivers, one of milk, one of wine, one of balsam, and one of honey.
We have already seen that ^B had about 15 letters to
the line. The haplography in the last interpolation in B is
evidently due to a careless copying of words arranged thus

the central line of the three being omitted, because either its end was similar to the end of line 1, or its beginning to the beginning of line 3. Bdellium was the name of a gum, used for medicinal purposes. But Tr. or his copyists having turned the word into Boellium, the glossator identified it with the Latin opalus.
His note is obviously a description of the opal set in the volcanic matrix (andesite or what not) in which it is found in nature. I have not traced the source of his information, but what he says about the stone seems to be a confused recollection of some description of the play of colours seen
when it is contemplated from different angles.
29. That Adam was created first and afterwards transferred to the Paradise was the general belief, following Genesis
iii. 7, 8. Damascus is named as the scene of Adam's creation, and of his retreat after the Fall : see Comestor, eh. xiii. This Tradition is followed by gW, ft 38.
The glosses upon oipriged and coimetad are obviously
suggested by Comestor. Tulit ergo Deus hominem de loco formationis suae in Paradisum, scilicet terrestrem, ut
operaretur ioi. Non tamen laborando ex necessitate, sed delectando et recreando, et sic Deus "custodiret ilium/' scilicet hominem. Vel utrumque refertur ad hominem, ut scilicet homo custodiret Paradisum et "operaretur" ut dictum
est. (Hist. Schol. xv.)
The interpolation y 1 is meant to explain away the discrepancy between the threat of immediate death upon
eating of the fruit, and the fact of Adam's survival for over
900 years. Comestor, again, is the source of y 2
: Praecepitque ei dicens, etc.; ut homo sciret se esse sub Domino, praeceptum
accepit a Domino (loc. cit.).

30. It is impossible to decide whether the string of
adjectives after sum and ben in this fl, which is anticipatory
of the vicious style of the later romance-writers, is due to
Tr. or to his copyists. But see the note to the following ff.
The idea that Adam's sleep was mantic rather than anaesthetic seems to be another borrowing from Comestor :
Non somnum, sed exstasim, in qua creditur supernae inter
fnisse curiae; unde et euigilans prophetauit de coniunctione Christi et Ecclesiae, et de diluuio futuro, et de iudicio per
ignem (Hist. Schol. xvi). It was, however, a common idea : Epiphanius (Adv. Haeres. II i 48) ingeniously proves it by
pointing out that Adam spoke of the past (os ex ossibus), present (ex uiro suo sumpta est) and the future (homo adhaerebit uxori sui) ! In the Old English Paraphrase of
Genesis and Exodus34 we read
God dede Sat he on sweuene cam,
And in Sat sweuene he let him sen, Mikal Sat after sulde ben.
Many other quotations to the same effect might be taken from various sources. The note is I seo cet faitsine appears to be due to a dullard homiletic glossator who has made several comments of the same kind on the text, and who is also probably responsible
for the silly note ami grada, etc. He did not observe that a predecessor had already called Adam's words, Ecce os etc.,
"the first coibche and the first prophecy which Adam made." The longer gloss is older than the shorter statement, as it comes later in the text. This is a very important critical
principle, of not infrequent application in the text before us. The annotator was in such a hurry to "hold his farthing rushlight to the sun" that he had not the patience to read a line or two further, when he would have found tha.t he had been anticipated. In fact, both wiseacres have been misled by careless reading of Comestor, who definitely asserts that the passage which follows (Quamobrcm, etc.) is the real prophecy (Hist. Schol. xix).

31. There is evidence in the beginning of this ff that the adjectival exuberance of the biblical translation is to some
i xtent giossarial. The superlatives attached to the Serpent in the original text have been multiplied by an annotator : they appear in the two mss. in a different order, which as before indicates the interpolation of an interlined gloss.
The interpolation y 1 appears to come from R2
, because Eve is represented as being the sole victim of the Serpent's
temptation. Comparison with the text of R2
(ff 4*) shows that co curp sewn is an interpolation made after the leaf of
*Q had come into R2
, but before the writing of *Z, the copy
of R2 used by gW. The omission of Iofer Niger is a striking feature in this version of the passage.
The envy of Lucifer against Adam is referred to by Comestor {Lucifer enim deiectus a Paradiso spirituum, inuidit Jiomini quod esset in Paradiso corporum, sciens si faceret eum
transgredi quod et ille eiiceretur (Hist. Schol. xxi)). For once, however, this is not the source of the interpolation : the idea had been in the text from before Comestor's time, and LGr, as we have seen, has no hint at the contrast between
the spiritual and the terrestrial paradise emphasized by Comestor. The interpolation y 2 has nothing to do with y1
.
It comes from a different source, and is most likely due to a different annotator. Before these interpolations were made the text probably ran thus : Ro oai nathair . , . -\ ro raid. As the interpolation
separated the subject from the verb, a later glossator inter
lined .i. in athair sin above ro raid. When the gloss entered the text is I evolved out of .i. This glossator's spelling of athair, without the initial n, has survived the vicissitudes of
his note after its incorporation.
32. This paragraph is much farced with glosses. After
ro hoslaicit a leaf has been lost from B. Its matter is
preserved in the eighteenth-century transcript /?, which is a
good, though not a perfect copy of the MS. The two other
eighteenth-century copies, p1
, /3

there would have been homoiotes at both ends—a fatal trap for s\/B.
On the first leaf of H, which begins in this fl, the topmost 16 lines of each column are torn away entirely, and some of the others are injured, as the tear runs obliquely. In fact, the first few of the surviving lines are reduced in this manner to a few letters only, which would be quite unintelligible
if we did not possess a perfect copy in M for comparison.
If this first leaf of H had been perfect, the surviving portion of that text would have begun somewhere about verse 4 of
the chapter, thus extending back to slightly before the beginning of the lacuna in B. It may be worth mentioning that the "Welsh antiquary,
Edward Lhuyd, according to a letter written by him on 20 December 1702, and printed in Archceologia Cambrensis, 1859, p. 246, was possessed of "an imperfect copy of the B[ook] of Genesis in Irish" bestowed upon him by a priest near Sligo, who told him that "in the opinion of one of their chiefest antiquitys [sic]" it "was very little later than the first
planting of Christianity' ' in Ireland. This fragment does not
seem to be preserved among Lhuyd 's mss. in Oxford; and

inclined to suspect that this "fragment of the book of Genesis" was no- other than H. If so, its Sligo provenance
may possibly be confirmatory of the suggestion made above
(p. 13) that the H leaves had been torn out to supplement the deficiencies of the Book of Ballymote. In that case, however, the deficiency was not that caused by the loss of folio 9, which must have taken place after Lhuyd's time, but
the chasm in this text described, loc. cit. Further, the depredation most probably took place before 1522, when the Book of Ballymote appears to have migrated from Sligo to Tir Conaill.
Dorad domh do chrcmn, omitting the definite article, is a literal translation from the Latin dedit mihi de ligno. It adds
a subtle point to the story, as suggesting that Adam professed ignorance of the tree from which the fruit had come; but unfortunately the Hebrew text disallows it. For the curious rendering acht me fern, see the notes on the Latin text.
34. The translator seems to have missed the point of the serpent's "lying in wait," and to have understood it to mean
self-protection rather than hostility. The gloss iomad galar mlsda dhuit is paralleled by a Kabbinic idea (Eisenmenger, i, p. 833) that this disability is due to a union between Eve and Sammael in the guise of the
Serpent. Further confirmation of our conclusions as to the nature of -tyB is here forthcoming. As the words d'indearna Dia . . . 1 do thalmain are absent in /3

that they were also absent in B. They just amount to two of the short lines of which we have already found

The eye of s\/B wandered from the beginning of the second of these lines to the beginning of the fourth.
35. Our worthy glossator seems to fear that subsequent readers, if not warned, would take Eve to be the mother of animals as well as of men !
How gH ascertained that the garments made for Adam

36. The perverse exegesis in the interpolation in this ff
is from Comestor : Ironia est, quasi uoluit esse ut Bens, sed in euidenti est modo quod non est (Hist. Schol. xxiv).
37. Y1 is clearly an incorporated gloss, the lemma of which is the sentence following. It filled the whole interlinear space above that sentence in the ms. from which it entered the body of the text, and thus it was taken in before the words
which it ought to have followed. That Adam and Eve remained virgin in Paradise was a notion suggested by the fact that Eve's name of universal mother is not recorded till after the Fall. Something of the idea will be found in Augustine, Civ. Dei xiii, 13, 14 : and it was emphasised in
the Bevelationes of Pseudo-Methodius, according to which,
Sciendum est quod exeuntes Adam et Eua de Paradiso uirgines fuerint; or as the Old English paraphrase expresses it/
3et owt of Paradyse when bey paste
clene vyrgenys were bey both
Our glossators, however, show no direct acquaintance with that singular production, and probably took the idea from Comestor, who gives a paraphrase of the words of PseudoMethodius in his chap. xxv. According to the Syriac Book
of the Bee, Adam and Eve remained virgins for 30 years after
their expulsion (ed. Budge, chap xviii). The interpretation of the name of Cain is borrowed in the first instance from Isidore : Cain possessio interpretatur,
unde etymologiam ipsius exprimens pater eius ait "Cain" id est (( Possedi hominem per Deum." Idem et lamentatio,
eo quod pro interfecto Abel interfcctus sit, et poenam sui
sceleris dederit. Abel luctus interpretatur (Etym. VH.



NOTES ON SECTION I. 235
vi. 7). We must regard no lamentacio as a gloss, although
Isidore gives the alternative interpretation, partly because, though in a Latin context, it is introduced by an Irish
conjunction, and partly because it is ignored in the subsequent matter. Both etymologies are of course wrong.
Caneithi is the Hebrew MTOp qamthi, "I have gotten," Lamentatio looks back to the quite independent Hebrew
word HTp qinah "a dirge." All these early commentators
overlook the fact, which a little knowledge of elementary
Hebrew grammar would have taught them, that it was Eve, not Adam, who said Possedi hominem. But they are in the good company of Augustine, Civ. Dei xv. 15. The idea expressed in y 3
, following many ancient
commentators and versions, that the acceptance of Abel's offering was indicated by fire from heaven, seems to go back
to the version of Theodotion, in which l'I£^ (respexit) is
translated ivtirvpiatv. It is, of course, developed under the influence of the narrative in I (III) Kings xviii (Elijah on Carmel). As usual, Comestor is the proximate source of the glossator's information : Quia placuit Deo Abel et pro ipso placuit oblatio eius, quod quomodo cognitum fuerit, alia translatio aperit.
' ' Inflammauit Deus super Abel et super munera eius." Ignis enim de coelo oblationem eius incendit.
(Hist. Schol. xxvi). There is no authority for the words a ttoirsi -\ in dabha,
which must be a glossarial expansion.
38. The simple account of the murder of Abel in B (as
preserved in the derivatives of that ms.) is clearly the original version, being based on the Genesis text. The interpolation in M, ro tad a da laim fo bragait cor ba marb (H here
unfortunately fails us) is as clearly borrowed from R2
. This introduces us to a further complication in the history of the
text—the borrowings from earlier redactions at late stages of development. This cannot be one of the borrowings originally made from *Z, as in that case it would have been
in B also.
Y

, in one form or another, must have been in yBMH.
The family had returned to Damascus where Adam was



236 NOTES ON SECTION I.
created—we need not vex the shades of the glossator by insisting that Damascus could hardly have been a cathair at this stage of the world's history, as he conceived it. Comestor
says of the expulsion from Paradise: Emisit eum Dommus de Paradiso Voluptatis . . . in agrum scilicet Damascenum,
de quo sumptus fuerat, in quo Cain Abel swum fratrem inter
fecit (Hist. Schol. xxiv).
Y
2 seems to be an extract from some homily upon Abel. The haplography attested by (3
012 must have been in B. It was easy for a scribe to commit (Abel do cet marb . . . Abel in cet martir) but for once it cannot be laid to the account of \/B, for the omitted words are too long for the 15-lettcr lines of "^B.
The variant of the question Quid fecisti in M is curious.
Presumably it is due ultimately to a reader who, having read Cid doroinnais e
l was moved to write in the margin Pecad 7 gnim n-adbal ! (He was of the spiritual kindred of Lucifer's critic in fl 3.) The loss of cid, which might easily happen after the preceding Cain (especially if it were written Caidin, as
in P) would result in the absorption of this note by the text.
Y
4 seems to come from another homily, in which reference was made to Genesis iv. 10, xviii. 20, and Luke xviii. 7, 8.
39. Once more we have a paragraph filled with glossarial
fatuities. The ms. from which coH, coM, and 00 B were copied, in this order (as .shown above, p. 14) must have had ro oslaic a bel, probably with an open a in oslaic. Both
00 M and 00 H independently misread this as ro slide Abel:
but 00 B copied it correctly, and in the derivatives from B the reading has been put beyond a doubt by inserting the
prefixed /. We have already seen that we cannot assume
a '1JMH differentiated from MJB ; the mistake must therefore
have been made twice. In the M tradition a number of
interpolations—three in this paragraph alone—have entered
the text, not found in H or in B. Y1 has been inserted by some one who did not take the trouble to observe that it
contradicts the biblical story, related a few lines above. But
it must have entered the M tradition before the story about
Abel's being strangled with Cain's hands (fl 38) was inserted.
For we may lay it down as a general principle that when we
have two contradicting interpolations (a) and (&), if they



NOTES ON SECTION I. 237
lun consecutively they may be contemporary, the glossator
setting down two opposing views between which he makes
no choice; or else (&), the second, may be later than (a),
having been interpolated by a second glossator to contradict what was already in the text. But if the two are separated
by some lines of text, then the probability is greatly in favour of («) being the later of the two, having been inserted by a
reader who has not yet reached (6) and does not anticipate
it.
The perverse notion that the mark of Cain was designed to secure a prolongation of his punishment is borrowed from
Comestor. " Omnis quis inuenerit me occidet me." Ex timore hoc dixit, uel optando dixit, quasi dicer et: JJtinam occidant me. "Dixitque ei Deus: Nequaquam ita fiet." Non cito
scilicet morieris, " sed omnis qui occiderit Cain"—supplendum
est, liberabit eum a timore, a dolore, et miseria—"septuplum
punietur." Id est, punitio fiet de eo dum uiuet in poena. There have been many speculations on the mark of Cain.
For once Comestor is jettisoned by our glossators, who say nothing about the theory adopted by him, that the mark was
a perpetual shaking of the head—that "he wagged alwey forb
wib his heued" as the Old English Lyff of Adam and Eue puts it. The 'lump in his forehead' goes back to a lost Book
of Lantech, which told how Lamech, under the guidance of his
son Tubalcain—for he was blind—shot an arrow at a wild man covered with hair, and with a horn growing out of his forehead, who proved to be Cain. Lamech was so distressed by the discovery that he killed Tubalcain. The additional
"lumps" are added by yM. under the influence of poem no. V
(quatrain 23). That Cain had no beard comes indirectly from the same authority, which states (lines 123, 124) that Seth
was the first man who grew a beard.
40. A glossator has doubtless introduced the appellation dlamus, in order to distinguish the Cainite from the Sethite Lamech. The interpretation of the wTord is most likely the work of a still later annotator.
41. That Naamah was a weaver or embroideress was a
commonplace of mediaeval apocryphal speculation. Probably
our glossator borrowed the fact from Comestor—Soror uero

Tubalcain Noema, quae inuenit arUm uariae texturae (Hist.

A sister had this brether alsua,
And sco was heiten Noema : Scho was the formest webster,
That man findes o that mister. That fader was the first o liue, That bigam was, wit dubul vijfe.
Ro chet-chum is a favourite construction in this text : the composition of cet with a verb, to denote "he was the first to ' ' perform whatever action is specified.
42. The difficult Song of Lamech has given trouble to the
translator, and apparently also to his copyists. The rendering
as we have it does not even make reasonable sense, to say nothing of its relation to the original text. Ro mharbus fer
amuigh aniu seems to have arisen out of Ro mliarbas fer am
guinib (the last word perhaps written guiniu), thus representing the Latin occidi varum in uulnus meum. The sentence
which follows is apparently a gloss, the original form of which was most likely .i. is inund q
" ro chrechtnaiges" annsin. The word sechtoll does not seem to occur elsewhere in Irish literature. It is curious that none of our meddlesome glossators have
come forward with the information—known to the author of
poem no. V, and universally believed—that Lamech 's victim was Cain.
43. Adam's speech is thus written in /3 : air Adhamli, \ar\
A. siol, etc., indicating that the scribe was puzzled by the word ar. It can scarcely be equated with the Irish ar,
"ploughing": it is perhaps a degeneration of the Hebrew
I'H* zer'a, "seed"—read backwards, like the Tetragrammaton in poem no. V. This word appears in the original of
the passage, and may have reached the Irish translator by some
circuitous route. At the end of this paragraph there comes the lacuna in
the B-tradition (see p. 13) which was there even before B
lost its leaf. The eighteenth-century copyists were conscious of
a gap in the sense, and each in his own way made a makeshift

stop-gap, here printed as fl 43a. H resumes in the course of
the following paragraph, and until M fails us at the end of

44. Y 2 like y 3
, was in M only. H is here defective, but a count of words shows that there was no room for it. According to a belief recorded by Comestor, Adam was only seven hours in Paradise (Quidam tradunt eos fuisse in
Faradiso sept em horas—Hist. Schol. xxiv). With this Cursor
Mundi more or less agrees (line 985)
For he [Adam] was wroght at undern tide, At middai Eue draun of his side. Thai brak the forbot als sun, That thai war bath don out at none.
A poem contained in the Book of XJi Maine specifies 134 hours : but the Master of Oxford makes the time seven years. The writer of y 2 must have copied it from some other literary source, as is indicated by the spelling Eba, by the here
superfluous specification of the nature of the sin, and by the description of the forbidden tree as Grand na Haithne (not
Fessa). Of the transfer of Adam's head to Golgotha, Comestor, with a critical judgement which he does not as a rule
encourage us to expect in him, wTrites as follows : Ambrosias, in Epist. ad Romanos uidetur uelle quod ibi sepultus fuerit Adam, et a capite eius dictum Caluariam; et ei dictum ab
apostolo: Surge qui dormis, exsurge a mortuis, et illuminabit
te Christ as. Be qua opinione dicit Hieronymus quod fauorabilis est interpretatio, et mulcens aures, non tamen uera. Vnde credimus hoc a. falsariis positum in Ambrosio. (Hist.
Schol. in Euangel. elxx). Of the burial of Adam in Hebron
we read in Cursor Mundi (line 1415)
Doluen he [Adam] was thoru Seth his sun, In the dale that hat Ebron :
and in Comestor : Locus in quo luxerunt [Adam and Eve,
after Abel] dicitur Vallis Lacrymarum iuxta Hebrom (Hist. Schol. xxv, doubtless suggested by Ps. lxxxiii [Hebrew lxxxiv]



240 NOTES ON SECTION I.
verse 7). This geography is a commonplace of the Adam apocrypha. The interpolation y3 is peculiar to M, and
probably came from the same literary source as y2
. The glossators have apparently never heard the Eastern story,
told in The Cave of Treasures, that the body of Adam was part of the cargo of the Ark, where it served the useful
purpose of keeping the men and the women apart ; and that
it was afterwards buried by Shem in Golgotha.
45 ff. Worthy of passing notice is a commentator, possibly
of ethnological or psychological interest, who was apparently
unable to conceive of large numbers except in scores, and
had to reduce the hundreds to that unit, in order to understand them.
50. Enoch was the central figure of a. vast mass of folklore and apocryphal literature. His existence "in desert places
and away from common life" is doubtless an expansion of the Biblical et non apparuit, but it may have reached the
Irish glossator from some special source. The ten names of God are thus enumerated by Isidore
{Etym. VII. i. 1) : El, Eloi, Eloe, Sabaoth, Elion, Eie, Adonai, la, Tetragrammaton, Saddai. The list gjven by Epiphanius {Adv. Haeres. I, iii, 40) is Sabaoth, Eli, Eloi, Israel, Sadadai,
Ellion, Rabboni, la, Adonai, Iabe. On their magical use, see Budge, Amulets and Superstitions, pp. 369 ff. From o anmandaib ecsamlaib in this paragraph to the end
of ]\ 52, M is our only authority for the text.
52. With the end of this paragraph the great lacuna begins
in M. Unlike sB, sM was conscious of the gap in his exemplar, ?nd left the remainder of the column, upon which he was writing, a blank, in the hope of filling in the missing matter
afterwards. This neither he nor the subsequent owners of M were ever able to do : and H, which now carries on the story, shows us that the space provided (32 lines in a column of
50 lines) was absurdly small.
We are still in the mutilated first leaf of H, which has lost the top lines of all its columns. The missing portions of the two texts slightly overlap, so that at this point there are a few lines of the text which are altogether lost, as well as



NOTES ON SECTION I. 241
portions of the beginnings and endings of others—covering
verses V. 31 (last clause) and VI. 1, 2, of the biblical text. In the gloss explaining the name of Noah, is Noe is doubtless to be corrected to .i. Noe.
53. From here on to ff 87 our only authority is H. The
first two verses of chap. VI, lost from our text, contain the fragmentary tale of intercourse between filii Dei and filiae
hominum. This tantalizing story was for long the subject of
speculation : and some copyist seems to have considered these speculations more interesting than the barren biblical narrative. That the "sons of God" were the Sethites, and
the "daughters of men" the Cainites, was the normal mediaeval solution of the enigma. It is set forth in PseudoMethodius as well as in Comestor, ch. xxxi, the Old English
Lyff of Adam and Eve, and many other authorities. The full story, as related in The Gave of Treasures, is to the effect that Adam, when dying, had commanded Seth and his descendants to remain on the holy mountain of Hermon, apart
from the offspring of Cain, and that this injunction was lepeated by each succeeding patriarch till the days of Yared (Jared, which means "descent"), when the Sethites broke their oaths and went down to the encampment of iniquity of the Cainites. The glossator has based his interpolation, with which the text resumes after the lacuna, upon the detailed paraphrase of this story in the Irish Sex Aetates Mundi. The ms. is here much injured. The inner edge of the leaf has been made ragged by tearing the fragment from its proper place (as described, p. 13 ante), and in consequence parts of several lines are lost. Some of the gaps can be filled
up by a collation of Sex Aetates (Rawl. B 502 facsimile) ; but not all, for the texts, though similar, are not identical. Restorations of the text are here contained within square brackets. The alternative explanation of the origin of the monsters, recorded here by a later glossator, will be found below, fl 81.
54. The glossator has forgotten that the descendants of Seth had their share in the production of the giants.
L.G. —VOL. I. R



242 NOTES ON SECTION I.
55. Here again an extract from Sex Aetates Mvmdi has been interpolated, and has ousted verses 5, 6, of the biblical text : a process facilitated by the fact that the two passages
began with the same words. The passage as it appears in Eawl. B, 502, reads Otchonairc Dia imorro tictain doib dar a thimna, ro chinnistar na doini do huili-dilgenn, coni do tucad in diliu. This has been expanded in our text by
glossators. The interpolation at the end of the paragraph is from another source.
57. Y2 is obviously suggested by Comestor's fuit liaec area in fundamento quadrata (Hist. Schol. xxxii). The interpolations y 3 a, b, are parts of a single marginal note that has become bisected, and has entered the text in
two different places—in the second place breaking very awkwardly into the sense. The information is derived in part from Comestor : Bitumine intus et extra Imita est, quod est
gluten feruentissimum quo ligna linita non dissoluuntur aliqua ui uel arte nee materia uel maceria bituminata solid potest ... In lacubus Iudaeae supernatans colligitur. In Syria limns est a terra aestuans. Comestor in his turn seems to have taken this from Isidore (Etym. XVI. ii. 1) : Bitumen in Iudaeae lacu Asplvaltite emergit, cuius glebas supematantes nautae seaphis adpropugnantes colligunt- In Syria autem limus est passim aestuans <h terra . . . Natura eius ardens et ignium cognata, et neque aqua neque ferro sumpitur . . . utilis ad conpages nauium. I can find no authority for the two persons who altruistically contributed to the success of an enterprise from which they themselves derived no benefit : the carpenter with the
improbable name Epiphenius, and the mixer of pitch whose name, in the absence of auxiliary evidence, cannot be
certainly read in the text : evidently sH could not read it clearly in yi[, and did his little best to copy it as it stood.

The curved line over the n is turned the wrong way for the

NOTES ON SECTION I. 243
of the n, and is attached to the top of the following I. The only expansion that I can think of is Dia-anarlaoite, as printed in the text, or perhaps Anarlarte. By a perverse fate the
name of the father of these brethren is torn away except the
end, 13, in which the minim is most likely part of an n. This gives -nus, a termination that will not fit any antediluvian
name in history or legend that I ever heard of. These names,
and the details of the construction of the Ark here set forth, and the prayers of Noah and his sons, appear to come from some lost homily or apocryphon.
58. Here again a glossator tells us of the peculiar matrimonial relationships of Noah and his sons, presumably
borrowing them from some late ms. of R2
.
59. On the importance of the discrimination between clean and unclean birds in this paragraph, see p. 9 ante. The
adjectives silteach saidbirm&y be original or glossarial, it is uncertain which, and matters little.
60-65. There is little in these paragraphs to call for notice other than what is referred to in the notes on the biblical
text. The glosses are more than usually naive : note especially the expression of admiration for the Ark at the end of ff 61, and the description of the proceedings of the dove in ff 65. If the latter is not an invention, it would be difficult to say whence the glossator obtained his information. Someone has
acutely observed that glosses like this express and partially satisfy a natural craving for an illustrated history-book. In
the absence of pictures, the annotator jots down picturesque details, which fill in the mental picture suggested by the words. That the first emission of the dove took place seven days after that of the raven is a glossator's discovery, with no
biblical authority.
66. The chronology of the Flood according to the inter
polation forming this and the following paragraph is not
easy to follow, and the attentions of glossators have added to
the confusion. But the following is clear (paying due
attention to the corrections, p. 127)

human physical life, the pious Enoch was the founder of human spiritual life.
78. The gloss i ona huilib fnaib is a good illustration of the haste of a reader, too impatient to read to the end of the sentence, where he would have discovered that' the birds had
not been forgotten.
80. Comestor says (on earlier authority) that the rainbow shall cease to appear forty years before the Last Judgement : Et tradunt sancti quod quadraginta, annis ante Indicium non v.idebitur arcus, quod etiam naturaliter ostendet desiccationein aeris iam incoeptam (Hist. Schol. xxxv). This paragraph is greatly influenced by the corresponding passage in Sex Aetates Mundi, from which also the long passage on the history of the rainbow comes. The absence from Sex Aetates of the anticipation that the bow will not appear before the Judgement indicates that this is a later intrusive gloss on the LG- text.
81. Here again the translation has been contaminated by an extract from Sex Aetates Mundi. The glosses also come from that work, so that the obvious interruption of the former by the latter is old. Jl3 interpolates the mutual slaying of
"the children of Dardan and Ioph," which does not refer to the Trojan war, as might appear at first sight, 36 but to the
destruction of the Midianites (Judges vii. 19 ff.) : Dadan and Ephai appear in the Latin version of the account of the family from which this people is said to have descended (Gen. xxv.
3, 4)W.e are not, however, to suppose a simple cross-copying from one book to the other. The curse on Ham, and the destruction of his descendants, were written in first : the further note, here printed in smaller type, attributing the
existence of monsters to the curse on Ham, must have been added as an interlined and marginal afterthought. This is
shown by its dispartition (compare the fate of the note on the composition of pitch, ff 57.)
36 Notwithstanding the occurrence of these names, in Trojan
connexion, among the descendants of Ham in Sex Aetates Mundi.

The word gid (in tucad gid dilgend) does not appear in
the corresponding- place in Sex Aetates Mundi (see Bawl. B, 502, facs. p. 71 b, line 49). I take it that the words in \/H were tucad aigid-dilgend "a death-destruction was brought" (on the persons of the Canaanites, and confiscation on their land). The missing letters were in a cor fd chasdn at the end of the preceding line, and were overlooked by sH.

The accompanying diagram sliows what must have lain before sH in the ms. (VH) which he was copying. The preceding ms. (^H) had nothing but the matter of the first and last of these lines in sequence (omitting, of course, the letters after lafeth in line 1). Later, someone wrote into the margin of "^H the note about the consequences which the
curse upon Ham had brought upon his Canaanite descendants.
After this, VH was copied from -fH.; and the copyist took
this note into the text, the writing being disposed as in the diagram. Still later, another scribbler, writing partly between the lines and partly in the margin, enriched \/H with the
further details about the monsters descended from Ham—an
item of special interest, apparently, as another glossator inserted it again in \/H, at fl 53.
When our ms. H was copied, history repeated itself. The new paragraph was incorporated in the text at what was obviously the most convenient place, the period preceding Iarsin in line 2. The scribe pursued it as far as da i nib, in the margin at the end of line 5 : but he failed to observe its conclusion, tucked into the blank space at the end of the
short line 6. He then returned to Iarsin : but the interlineation which he had already copied, and at which he did not look again, screened from his vision the cor fd chasdn, which must have concluded the first line and contained
the beginning of the obviously imperfect word "gid." There



NOTES ON SECTION I. 247
must have been no more than a short sentence before Iarsin originally : a longer sentence would have filled up the
preceding line to the end, kuving no space for the indispensable cor fa chasan. This is an additional argument for the secondary nature of the "monsters" gloss. It is most fortunate that sH possessed in abundant
measure the most valuable of all endowments for a scribe
ww-intelligence. He copied by rote what lay before him : its
meaning, if it had any, was not his concern—that was the affair of his betters. Owing to this admirable quality, he failed to identify, in the words at the end of line 6 when at last he reached them, the end of the "monsters" note which
he had copied only a few moments before—although he had already copied out its whole text some time previously, when
writing ff 53. He therefore transcribed them just as they stood, and made no attempt to insert them in their proper place. It never occurred to him that "gid dilgend" was
incomprehensible nonsense. Had he realised these things, he would infallibly have made disastrous efforts after emenda
tion, and would thus have destroyed all the clues !

, while copying these details, omits a censure upon the Gaedil for ascribing the monsters to the Cainites, this being a violation of the scriptural truth that all life perished in the Flood. Augustine (Civ. Dei XVI. 8) discusses at length
whether the monstrous races of men (in which there was in his time at least a half-belief : he gives a list of these deformities of folklore) were descendants of Noah, and answers
in the affirmative. He does not, however, call in the curse
of Ham to account for them.
82. The genealogical chap, x is lost. The heterogeneous paragraphs which follow the Biblical translation represent
various attempts to fill its place.
83. The story of the Tower of Babel is very diffuse, and
departs widely, in its language at least, from the biblical
text. The lacunae near the beginning are due to a tear which mutilates the inner margin of the leaf.
"Hebrew," says Augustine (Civ. Dei XVI, 2), "was the
common language of the race of men till the time of Heber
father of Pefeg, when the earth was divided. Till then it did



248 NOTES ON SECTION I.
not require a distinctive name, but after that it was called
Hebrew, after Heber. " Nowhere can the origin of the name
Gorthigern, given to this primitive language by Irish historians and grammarians, be discerned : we might guess
that it is a corruption of some sort of rendering of the Vox Domini of the Psalter, the language being assumed to be the speech of Heaven. [It may be desirable to explain here, in condonation of
the use of the symbol A for the Latin manuscript which lies
at the basis of the biblical text which we have been studying, that it has been chosen simply because it is one of the very
few symbols not already pre-empted by the elaborate apparatus criticus of the Vatican edition. There is not the slightest fear of its ever being confused with the St. Gall ms.]
86. The biblical extract is followed by a miscellaneous collection of snippets, with the basal text *Q acting as framework. For an analysis of this part of the compilation see the introduction to the present section. In these paragraphs, the
parts belonging to *Q are printed in ordinary type, the stratification of interpolations being roughly indicated by two
varieties of smaller type. This paragraph is in H only, but
the lacuna of M ends at the beginning of the poem. The
particulars as to the place of death of the patriarchs are doubtless taken primarily from poem no. V, quatrain 42 : but from what source it reached that authority I have not discovered, and until it is found attempts at explaining Eafan and Eadruip would be mere guesswork. Formeinia,
of course, = Armenia, and the mountain intended is no doubt Ararat.
87. In H and M, apparently from R2
, or from some text depending thereon. The comment regarding the age of Adam seems to come from this passage of Comestor, quoting Pseudo
Methodius : Et anno creationis uitae Adam decimo quinto natiis est ei Cain et soror eius Chalmana. Et si enim factus est Adam quasi in aetate triginta annorum tamen fuit unius diei et anni (Hist. Schol. xxv).
88. This comes from *Q. See the notes on R1
, ff 7. The
appended gloss, though containing the same substance as the



NOTES ON SECTION I. 249
corresponding gloss in fl 7, is differently worded and must have been introduced independently.
89. The last sentence and the appended quatrain continue the matter from *Q : but before it a passage from Sex Aetates
Mundi has been interpolated. This includes the first verse of a poem (gfiven in full in Sex Aetates) and the tabular statement of the ages of the Patriarchs. These figures agree with Sex Aetates against all versions of the biblical text (except the Irish translation printed above) in the case of Seth : against all versions including the Irish translation in the ease of Mahalaleel : and with all versions against the Irish translation in the cases of Methuselah and Lamech.
90. In H only, of unidentified origin. But see below ff 92.
Two successive readers have appended speculations on how the Goidelic language came to be.
91. Also in H only. It is mutilated by a tear from the
inner margin of the leaf, and would be unintelligible if it were not borrowed from Sex Aetates Mundi, with the aid of
which text it can be partly restored—though with some slight
verbal differences—from the copies in Rawl. B. 502 and in B. The words acht a leigiud a fo-tasgor na cinel appear in
Rawl. (41 d 20) from which B differs only in some
orthographical trifles, in the form acht a lecud hi
fothechdas na genel n-aile. The following passage from Isidore (IX ii. 39) appears to be the basis of the paragraph :
Nam quod ex filio Cham qui vocatur Mesraim Aegyptii sunt exorti, nulla hie resonat origo uooabidi, sicut nee Aethiopum,
qui dicuntur ad eum filium Cham pertinere, qui Chus
appellatus est. Et si omnia considerentur, plura tamen gentium mutate quam manentia uocabula apparent, quibus
postea nomina diuersa dedit ratio. See also Augustine, Civ.
Dei, XVI, 6.
92. The beginning of this fl is in BM as well as H, but
it is a continuation of the matter in H 90; H 91 being a later
interpolation. The text of *Q then resumes : note how the
correction about the number of the sons of Shem has been taken over. The passage is much farced with interpolations.
The formula cia ainmigter . . . ni tabar a n-airem comes from



250 NOTES ON SECTION I.
Sex Aetates Mundi, as also does H's note, which has ousted its lemma, to the effect that the unnamed sons had
descendants, but of no importance. The summary
enumeration of the sons of Shem and of Japhet in R1 has been expanded by reference, not to the Biblical source, but
to Isidore (IX ii 26 ff.). He enumerates the sons of Japhet thus : Gomer (ancestor of Galatae i.e., Galli), Magog (supposed ancestor of Scythians and Goths), Madai (supposed ancestor of Medes), Ieiuan (ancestor of Ionians, who are the Greeks, and eponym of the Ionian Sea), Thubal (ancestor of Iberi
who are the Hispani, by some supposed ancestor of the Italians), Mosoch (ex quo Cappadoces, unde et urbs apud eos usque hodie Mazaca dicitur), Thiras (ancestor of Thracians). By some misunderstanding the city of Mazaca (Caesarea in
Cappadocia) has become an unauthorized additional son, Maisechda, whose descendants a later interpolator naturally
sought in vain : see below fl" 95 L. The variant in H (i ni lobar .... tabairt forro) is an adaptation of a similar passage in Civ. Dei, XVI, 3.
93. This paragraph in H only. It is borrowed from R2
(ft 15). It is not clear why the order of the sons of Noah has been reversed.
94. This paragraph, more or less mutilated, is in all the
mss. It comes from R1
, but there are some traces of the
influence of R2
. The version before us gives some good readings. It is more probable that Fir net Scitluet should decline into Farsacca, and that this, owing to the constant association of "Medes and Persians, ' ' should develop a prefixed Media, than that Farsacca (protected by the associated Media
from misunderstanding) should evolve into Fir na Scithia,
The phrase Is Had lucid net Heorpa uile is now exposed as a
marginal gloss, taken into the text in different places: and
"Greens mac Iafeth" is likewise shown to be an intruder
into the text of R1
.
95. For convenience of reference this very long paragraph
is broken into sections, denoted by capital letters. Most of
it comes from Sex Aetates Mundi (here referred to as SAM) :
it is found in H only.



NOTES ON SECTION I. 251
A.—The gloss no Eonae and the secondary gloss .i. an
seindser, are not in SAM. But the additional son of Japhet appears, there named Masseca.
B.—The interpolated explanation of the name Gallograeci is based on Isidore, Etym., IX, ii, 68. {Galatae Galli esse noscuntur, qui in auxilium a rege Bithyniae euocati regnum
cum eo parta victoria diuiserunt: sicque deinde Graecis admixti primum Gallograeci, nunc ex antiquo Gallorum nomine Galatae nuncupantur.)
C.—Also based on Isidore, Etym., IX, ii, 69 (Graeci ante Thessali a Thessalo, postea a Graeco rege Graeci sunt
nuncupati).
D.—This section only repeats well-worn etymological speculations with neither value nor authority behind them. The harmonistic identification of Rifath with Ibath is perhaps
worth a passing acknowledgement.
E.—Taken direct from the list of Japhet 's descendants in
Isidore Etym., IX ii, 26 ff. (Filii Gomer nepotes Iaphet, AscJianaz a quo Sarmatae quos Graeci Rheginos uocant,
Riphatli a quo Paphlagones, Gotorna a quo sunt Phryges). "l Ilia" must be a gloss.
F.—Madai, a quo Medos existere putant : Isidore, loc. cit.
We shall hear of the eight Medians who ruled the world, in due course, in some of the later synchronistic insertions.
G.—A combination of Isidore and SAM. According to the former : Filii lavan Elisa, a quibus Graeci Elisaei, qui uocantur Aeolides. TJnde et lingica quinta, Graece AloXic,
appellatur; and again, Iauan, a quo Tones, qui et Grae'ci-;
unde et Mare Ionium. In SAM we read : Iaban a quo Ioni sunt, et a quibus nominatur Ionicum Mare, -\ is uadib
rogenatar Eolldai -\ a quibus 7iominantur Iolici. Ocus is uaidib ainmnigthir in cuiced berla na Greci i. Berla Eolla. There is no reference to Alexander the Great in either source.
H. —Isidore, loc. cit. : Tharsis a quo Cilices, ut Ioseph us arbitratur- Unde et metropolis ciuitas eorum Tharsus dicitur Cetlmn, a qiw Citii id est Cyprii, a quibus liodieque urbsCitium nominatur. Dodanim, a quo RJiodii. I cannot find



252 NOTES ON SECTION I.
any justification for the quoting of Civ. Dei as an authority, unless it be this sentence from XVI, iii, ad init. : Coeptae
.sunt cnim commemorari a mmimo fUo qui meatus est lapheth.
A poor latinist, with an ill-written MS., might mix up
"Coeptae" with "Seithim," and "lapheth" with "Ioif," and
produce the reading presupposed. An absurd reading, but probably most of us have heard or perpetrated equal
absurdities in our own schooldays.
I.—This comes from some other source. The islands are admittedly enumerated from memory, and the names appear
to be distorted : Edict, Sicil and Creid are the only ones whose identification is clear. Corbdith and Ceitliiria are presumably the Cycladic islands Carpathos and Cytherea. Rodain I conjecture (with fitting hesitation) to be the Balearic Islands,
which were colonized by Khodians, and are roughly speaking
opposite the mouth of the Rhone {Rhodanus).
K.—Thubal, a quo Iberi qui et Hispani: Hat quidam ex
eo et Italos suspicentur. The Irish compiler is less cautious than Isidore. The remainder of this section apparently comes from Augustine (Civ. Dei, VII, 4).
L.—Mosoch, ex quo Cappadoces, wide et urbs apud eos
usque lwdic Mazaca dicitur; Thiras, ex quo Th races,—Isidore,
loc. cit. The Irish writer does not trouble himself with the Cappadocian city of Mazaca, which, as we have already seen,
has become "Maissegda" son of Japhet, SAM, while briefly enumerating the descendants of the sons of Japhet, though
mentioning this fiction in the preliminary text, does not, like
the author of the interpolation before us, confess that
information about his progeny is missing. It gives us the
extra-biblical information that Thiras had seven sons: and
then enumerates the children of Corner, as they appear in § E
above. But it does not. like the text before us, duplicate the
personality of Rifath.
M. Magog, a quo arhitrantur Scythas ct Gothos traxisse
origin cm : Isidore, loc. cit. The identification of the Goths
and the Gaedil follows from the historical sojourn of the
former, and the legendary sojourn of the latter, in the land
of the Scythians, of which we shall hear later. The matter



NOTES ON SECTION I. 253
of this section, in shorter: form, appears in SAM : Isidore remarks further : Gothi a Magog filio Iaphet nominati putantur de similitudine ultimae syllabae, quos ueteres magis
"Getas" quam "Gothos" uocauerunt (IX, ii, 89).
N.—This repeats matter which has already appeared in R1 (U 9) and will be found again in ff 98, taken from *Q. The text here is different, and more closely in accordance with
that in SAM. The paternity of Baath is differently given, and the genealogical steps between him and Elenus or Alanus are omitted. Longbardus has been duplicated, and his double
has been made into a fourth son of Negua. SAM differs
from E3 as to the geographical connexion of Albaniis : we there read .i. ota ind Albcrin airtherach isind Assia Moir.
0.—Borrowed from SAM, with an interpolation on the descent of the Franks and the Romans from Alanus.
P.—Only the beginning from SAM. The rest is the orthodox LCr tradition, though the family of Barachan is new.
Q.—Mostly from SAM but with some expansion. "Sliab
Mai ' ' can be identified with Amanus by the help of Comestor
(Filii Iaphet tenuerunt septentrionalem regionem a Tauro et
Amano montibus Ciliciae et Syriae usque ad fluuium
Tanaim—Hist. Schol. xxxvii). Isidore testifies to the same distribution : Haec sunt gentes de stirpe Iaphet, quae a Tauro monte ad aquilonem mediam partem Asiae et oninem Europam
usque ad Oceanum Brittanicum possident. The sentence
relating to Spain appears to be corrupt. In SAM it reads : 1 in Espain n-uilidi co huilinn talmain (Rawl) or -\ conice in
Easpain uilide fodeis .i. treuilleach, which is nearer our
present text. Tre-uilleach is written rinlle^c, which
suggests a possible origin for the mysterious word uuillflichc ; but tre-uillig also appears in the text before us, and if this excludes the explanation suggested, I can only conjecture that it is a corruption of Astures.

eius, et dixit eum Ionithum. Trecentesimo anno dedit Noe donationes filio suo Ionitho, et dimisit eum in terram Ethan, et intrauit earn Ionithus usque ad inwe orientis, quod dicitur
Elioschora, id est, " solis regio." Hie accepit a Domino

alleged "Revelations" popularized this personage in Europe.
He passed into the traditions of the founding of Rome, the greatness of which he was said, to have foretold. See CI. A.
Graz, Roma nella memoria e nelle immaginazioni del medio
eve, Torino, 1882, I, p. 86. 38 The legend is of oriental origin. According to the Cave of Treasures Nimrod learned wisdom from Yon ton son of Noah, but the devil afterwards perverted the teaching, which accounts for the mixture of good and evil in astrology, magic, etc. The Book of the Bee gives Y6nat6n
as the name of the post-diluval son, whom Noah loaded with gifts and sent forth "to the fire 39 of the sun" in the east.
97. In H only. A history of the beginnings of the arts,
clearly an imitation—almost a parody—of the inventions attributed in Genesis to the sons of the Cainite Lamech. Eve's penitence in the Tigris is the central incident in the Book of
Adam and Eve and related apocryphal documents. The twin
sister of Cain is usually (following Pseudo-Methodius) called Calmana. Is uimpi doronad an t-ed refers to the story that the real cause of Abel's murder was the desire of both brethren to marry this sister : a dispute in which Adam took the part of Abel, as he considered that Cain's twin consanguinity was too close for an admissible marriage. The brother 'Pendan' appears in the later redaction of Tenga Bith-nua (Revue
Celtique, xxviii, p. 300) as a second victim of Cam's jealousy. Two long interpolations have divorced Oliuana from her husband Japhet. The erection of the pillars is attributed to Seth by
Josephus, who is apparently the source of this frequently

repeated story (Antiqq. I, ii, 3). The Irish writer has missed the point of the difference in the materials of the pillars. According to Josephus, there were two pillars, one of brick and one of stone. If the anticipated destruction came by
water, the stone pillar would survive, if by fire the pillar of brick.

relationships of these communities will be found. They are
there derived from the Fir Bolg, not, as here, from the
Nemedians. One or other of the two references to Tindi s. Conri in the paragraph before us, must be intrusive : it is not certain which, as the Genealogical Tracts assign him to the Fir Taiden. These, with the Domnannaig and the Fir Craibe, constituted the "three original Connachta." Sliab (F)uirri is in Galway, near the Roscommon boundary, and close to Ballygar.
101. This paragraph, as is explained in the introduction, begins a translation of the early Latin text. It was headed
Miniugud Gabal nErenn "An explanation (i.e. translation) of the 'Takings of Ireland'." The following words were doubtless added when the text (originally independent) was
tacked on to R2
, to supplement the deficiencies of that version. Ethre i mbcolo aissyieisen ''an end (or tail) in a mouth of relation" rendered by Thurneysen (Zu ir. ffandschr. u.
Lit. ii, 5) as "recapitulation" perhaps might rather be supposed to refer to the end of a chain of oral transmission, and be translated "tradition." 6 thosuch in libair aniias : an editorial note, inserted to
link the text to R2 to which it is now appended. Hybernia insola, etc., down to il insola" Latine dicitur, is
probably the preface of the original text.
Then follows an interpolation derived from Isidore (XIV, vi, 6) as Thurneysen has already observed : it is not reproduced quite correctly in our mss. : the true readings of Isidore are given here in footnotes to the text, There are
two glosses, one explaining the corrupt Hiberniam (for Hiberiam) and the other contradicting the oft-quoted
statement, disseminated by Solinus, as to the absence of bees.
Scoti autem a Scota adnotentur is an additional interpolation, suggested by the reference to the Seotnrum gentes in the excerpt from Isidore.
The sentence beginning Plioeni autem is a further inter
polation, interrupting the remarks about the Scots. Their identification with the tatooed Picts in this passage is
contrary to all the orthodoxy of the LG tradition.
With Heriu dono the original passage resumes: this follows on naturallv to the etymological speculations



NOTES ON SECTION I. 257
interrupted by the intruded excerpt from Isidore. Here again an unusual idea is suggested. The comment s. q. 1. is
a frequent formula, of complaint regarding a passage which a reader found it hard to understand. It is equivalent to the difficilis est haec pagina of the Saint-Gall Priscian.
Quasi scissi is another etymological interpolation, a guess by some wiseacre at the origin of the word Scoti.
Verse Texts.
Metre : the two quatrains forming this composition are
probably, in origin, independent compositions, as is suggested by their diversity of metre. The second is in. cmbairdne
(7 3 + 7 3
) with trisyllabic rhymes between lines 2 and 4; the first is in sndm sebaic, a variety in which the third line ends
with a monosyllable. The text has been greatly corrupted by scribes, who tinkered with it unrestrainedly in the vain hope of extracting more sense out of it than the author or authors ever put into it : as the verses are mere displays of metrical gymnastics, the meaning is of minor importance in an endeavour to restore the text. In addition to the rhymes, there is assonance between the first two lines of each stanza, and an alliteration in every line, which the attentions of the scribes have to some extent suppressed. This is the chief help toward
restoring the text. The ms. P has been re-inked unintelligently.
1. Sluag has evidently been changed to the plural after the incorporation of the second quatrain, bringing another ' ' host ' ' into view. Both alliteration and meaning help us to choose cua-chel "a winter (or rainy) death" as the true
reading, although it happens to be found only in the three
inferior derivatives from B. Conad has arisen from a misreading of a mark of prolongation as an abbreviation for n : the same mistake is probably at the base of F's ecnad. In sndm sebaic there is no necessity for vowel-assonance between lines 1 and 3, and therefore we can read eel, "death, fate" instead of the less tractable eel "an omen."
L.G.—VOL. I. S

2. The insertion of oc in MH (not in B) is an attempt to
mend the metre, after Noe had come to be pronounced as a
monosyllable, Nai. The alliteration decides for niath-Un against rival readings.
3. The evidence for the infixed pronoun (ronglead) is
hardly strong- enough to justify us in adopting it, though it
may be right.
4. Iatafen in E is an attempt to mend the metre, the name
having sunk into a dissyllable.
8. The rhyme with dibada teaches us the pronunciation Olluana.

Metre : debide irnrind.
Apparently a. variant of poem V quatrain 40, not found

another poem on similar lines, as V is in debide scdilte, and has only two quatrains (23, 49) in debide imrind.
III.
Metre : debide scdilte.
A variant of poem V quatrain 41, likewise not found in
any complete text of the poem. In Min these two quatrains run continuously, as though forming one extract : this may be original, the matter which separates them in the other Kedactions being editorial. Nae is here still a dissyllable, but Iafeth is no longer trisyllabic. The variant do dec in the last line has obviously arisen from a misreading of the numeral sign .u.

Metre : debide scdilte. The versifier began by making alliterative linkages (conacJilann) between the end of every quatrain and the beginning of the next, but after the seventh quatrain abandoned the effort : no re-arrangement of the quatrains can establish the device after this point, and we must assume that the few cases to be found in the latter part of the poem are accidental. There are two versions of this long composition, contained in not a few modern mss. I have collated several of these in
the Royal Irish Academy40 without finding anything of importance : no version contains the isolated variants which
40 23 A 40, F III 2, 23 M 18, C vi 1, 24 P 13. Of these 23 A 40
23 M 18 audi Cvl belong- to the M group and show nearly all of its peculiar readings and) arrangements of the quatrains. Except for
scribal mistakes (as abartar for abar, line 98 (23 A 40)) or the peculiar
spelling Caidin for Cain in 23 M 18, they show no particular individu
ality. A later hand has inserted into 23 A 40 an attribution of the
poem to Eochaid ua Floind : 23 M 18 is content to say Ollamh eigin cct.
E III 2 and) 24 P 13 are closer to the printed version. F III 2, which
attributes the poem to Colum Cllle, closely follows EP in its readings.
The following variants may be worth noting: line 58 (this spurious
quatrain is present, as in EP) dib gain, Chaim: line 68 Agania (for
Gogoma): line 89, tri troth go leith, nl luad saobh: line 129, ro fasadh
Mii. ccnoic: line 142, Tubadh Caoin. Stanzas 28-30, 34, 37, 39, 45, 46,
50 are omitted. The city in line 251 is called Imbitena, as in D ; in 263
we find Etrosius—one of many proofs afforded by Irish mss. that
although c was always pronounced hard in Irish, it was pronounced as
s before i and e in Latin. 24 P 13 has also close affinity with EP, but has nothing of importance to tell us.

we have seen in nos. II, III above. In the mss. before us, M
may be taken as the type of the one text, R2 of the other.
H, on the Avhole, follows R2
, but U (the Book of Vi Maine),
which has a fine copy in a different context, follows the M
version. Referring back to the diagram, p. 14 ante, I am
now inclined to think that the two folios, 2 and 7, disappeared
together, and had both gone when coM transcribed the text.
He recognised the torso of the poem, and found another copy
from which to supply the missing quatrains (1-30). M and
H appear to agree against R2 more frequently in the second half of the poem than in the first.
42. Mac maith Muire ingine (an unconscious lapse into
the heresy of Sabellianism !) is peculiar to M among the
manuscripts here used. Though not in U, it is a reading of
the M version of the text.
43. None of the mss. indicate the nasalization after dr.
46. Maiss, the chaotic material out of which the universe was fashioned.
52. The "clouds" (neoil) are introduced to make an assonance with coin. The poet takes advantage of the freedom in debide rhyme to unite the long vowel in gle with the short vowel in Darddine. Some peculiar minor verbal
differentiations appear in the M text in this quatrain.
54. The assertive interjection Bebrad is here left untranslated, in view of the uncertainty attaching to its etymology. As everyone knows, an over-indulgence in this
expletive was one of St. Patrick's few human weaknesses.
57. This stanza breaks the conachlann, which has not yet been abandoned; and as it appears in two mss. only it is probably spurious, even although it is a necessary supplement
to the preceding stanzas, which describe the works of creation. It is here printed as in E, with the addition of punctuation and prolongation marks only. Dcg-dail, the company
listening to the narrative. Anmann must be for anmunna
(the a elided before the following vowel); this, and the accusative deilb, are governed by aisneidfcd. Note the article with a noun depending on a proper-name genitive in the last line.

This, however, does not bring us nearer to discovering the origin of the Irish version of the story. Verses which appear to be a. rather remote variant of these quatrains, found in Codex Palatino-Vrtticamis (Todd Lectures, III, p. 24) revert to the prose version (Garad, Arabion [or Aradon, or Adilon], Laban, and Dagaria [or Gagaria]). The poet has also his
own views as to the course of the rivers of Paradise. Tairis if the reading of all the mss., but we should doubtless emend this to tairse : the rivers ran through the (fern.) land, not the (masc.) head. In this stanza we note an important deviation
in the M text.
69. Trdtli(a) means "days," as is more usual in this text, not (canonical) hours, on account of the reference to Christ's three days in the tomb. The first couplet of this
quatrain is metrically faulty, as both lines end in a dis
syllable. That Adam was for some time without life is a popular belief in apocryphal literature : but it is quite
independent of the three-days' sojourn of Christ in the tomb, with which it is here typologically connected. In fact, the stories vary as to the length of time which elapsed before the
body of Adam was quickened. A Muslim legend shows some
affinity with the ideas here expressed. "Allah formed Adam out of a handful of dust . . . which . . . had been collected from different parts of the world, and consisted of various
kinds of soil, which accounts for the divers colours of men and women. When Allah had formed Adam, He left the
figure lying lifeless forty days—some say forty years—while

notice was sent to the Angels, the Jinn, and the Jan, to be ready to worship and do him honour as soon as Allah had put breath into his nostrils. 41
73. Trior presumably means the three Persons of the
Trinity, who are represented as collaborating in the creation
of Adam—another variant from the conception in the prose text. To make any sense of the cheville at the end of line 75 we should have to read bet did ndeoin "by Their good will" : but no ms. supports this.
77. An abridged translation of quatrains 10-13, 15 will
be found in Archdeacon Seymour's paper. The Book of Adam and Eve in Ireland,42 which should be in constant reference
in studying the apocryphal Adam matter in this compilation. Pairtech, the "great mountain" of Paradise, is new: it appears again in the form Pariath in the Lebor Brecc history of the creation (Todd Lectures, III, p. 48). Adam's hymn of praise is a commonplace of apocrypha. In Pirqe Rabbi
Eliezer, chap. II, we read "And as [Adam] saw the creatures which God had made he began to praise God his Creator, and said: Lord, how great and many are Thy works!"
81-2. Another metrically faulty couplet, both lines ending in a monosyllable.

her greatly. And Adam and Eve were in Paradise, clothed with glory and shining with praise, for three hours." (Tr.
Budge, pp. 59-60).
87-8. This apparently refers to the naming of the birds :
at least I can find no other story connecting Adam with birds.
Syncellus. Chronography, gives the dates of the incidents of Adam's life thus: 1st day of week [3rd day of Creation of
Adam, 8th of Nisan, 1st of April. 6th of Phamouthi] Adam
named wild boasts : 2nd day. named cattle : 3rd day. named fowls : 4th day, named creeping things, etc., etc.

NOTES ON SECTION I. 263
91. All the mss. read do nim, which is unmetrical, and
incidentally nonsense. It seems best to emend it to do-gnim
(gen. plur.) "of evil deeds," the complementary formation to
so-gnlm, "a good deed."
96. These words spell the letters of the Tetra gramma ton
i""niT the Hebrew divine name Ydhweh, inaccurately rendered "Jehovah" in European popular speech. The notion that the Devil was the first to invoke the name of God
reappears in Salomon and Satumus (ed. cit. antea, p. 191)
"Who first named the name of God? the devil first named) the name of God. ' '
We find the statement repeated in the Colloquy of Adrian and
Ritheus (ibid., p. 204), and also by the Master of Oxford
"Who cleped first God?—The devyll. •"
The basal idea doubtless is that the devil acquired power over the Deity by knowing and using His secret name. 43 The poet 's knowledge of Hebrew was limited to the letters of the alphabet and their names, possibly learnt from the section-headings in Ps. exix (Vulgate cxviii) ; and to the external appearance
of the Tetragrammaton. He did not even know that Hebrew is written and read from right to left, so that when he spelt out the letters of the divine name he enumerated them in
the reverse order—the left-to-right order in which he was accustomed to read or write Latin or Irish.
97. An aetiological myth to account for the superiority of the right hand to the left. In an account of the Creation
and subsequent events in T.C.D. ms. H 2 5, most of which
follows LG closely, I find this : Ro hiomuil imorro Adamh an t-ubhall q ro bad tarnocht da eis, -\ les ta lamh chle seochus lamh dheas ann, mar as I an lamh chle sineadh chum an ubhaill. "A. ate the apple and became naked thereafter [compare Cod. Pal. Vat., p. 54] and therewith the left hand comes after the right hand, for it is the left hand that was stretched to the apple." I have not come across the idea elsewhere in apocrypha, though doubtless it exists.
43 For analogies see Frazer, Taboo and the Peril of the Soul, p. 387 ff.



264 NOTES ON SECTION I.
101. The expulsion of the errant pair to Egypt is un
orthodox : Damascus is the usual place of their exile. The "one palm" suggests that the poet did not know the difference between dates and figs.
105. Throughout the poem the name Cain is treated as a
dissyllable. P sometimes emphasises this by spelling it Caidin.
109. The poet, writing presumably from memory, has forgotten that Cain's offering was "of the fruits of the earth." Once again we see a faulty couplet, with the end words having the same number of syllables.
124. Seth was the first man to grow a beard, for Adam was presumably created with his bea,rd, Abel died a beardless youth, and it was part of Cain's punishment to have no beard (as in the prose text fl 39). But no ancient authority known to me explains how Seth was a witness of the murder of Abel (which took place before he was born), why he "put Lis hand to the jawbone," or what he did with it.
127. That stones "grow" is still an article of popular belief : I have been shown, by a Co. Meath farmer, a stone
with a mark upon it which, he believed, was produced by the pressure of another stone, while the marked stone was "growing." Salomon and Saturnus agrees with our poet that this growth had been stopped by the flow of Abel's
blood. We there read
"Tell me why stones are not fruitful?-—Because Abel's blood
fell upon a stone when Chain his brother slew him with the jawbone of an ass."
Also in The Master of Oxford's Catechism
"Why bereth not stonys froyt as trees?—For Cayne slough his
brother Abell with the bone of an asse cheke. "
139. The tale of how Lamech accidentally slew Cain is cue of the most familiar legends of Apocrypha. It is of Jewish origin, and as stated above, in the notes to f 39, was probably imported into Christian tradition from a lost "Book of Lamech." See Seymour, op. cit., p. 130, for references to which add the quotation from Eabbi Solomon Jarchi in



NOTES ON SECTION I. 265
Eisenmerger's Entdecktes Judenthum, vol. i, p. 470. The weapon used by Lamech was, however, an arrow ; not an apple, as in the text before us.
142. The name Tubalchain must be scanned as a tetrasyllable, to give a rhyme for brig : we must therefore follow E
in reading is, as against the ocus of other mss. On the other
hand it is a trisyllable in line 144, unless E is right in
emitting the following article. But D emphasizes the difference by a difference of spelling.
143. The words in cara are difficult to deal with. See Meyer, Contribb. s.v. cor for the meaning suggested in the translation.
145. I know of no other version of the almost nauseatingly silly story of the subsequent adventures of Abel's ram, narrated in this and the following quatrains.
148. It is common sense that this must refer to "the ram caught in the thicket," which provided a surrogate for Isaac : and that the original version ran dar cend meic Aprdni (not Apraim, which is forbidden by the rhyme : Apram is in declinable). Some meddler, however, older than the existing ms. tradition, oblivious of the story of the sacrifice
of Isaac, assumed vaguely that the event must have been something or other in the history of the Children of Israel ;
so he changed the genitive singular to genitive plural.
153. This quatrain seems out of place : it probably should
follow quatrain no. 15. The name of the tree is given as
Sezen in the Ethiopic Book of Mysteries of Heaven and Earth.
(See Budge, Cave of Treasures, p. 66); as Deachuimhan
["tithing"] in the late version of Tenga Bithnua (Rev. Celt.
xxviii, 300).
155. We have heard of "the plain of Aron" before, as the region over which the rivers of Paradise flow. This looks
like a confusion based on some old misreading of the Hebrew source (the "7, d, in "Eden" being misread as "I r). The contrary mistake is made in the Greek version of Numbers xxvi. 36.



266 NOTES ON SECTION I.
163. Deicli mbliadan risin idle, i.e., ten years in addition to all the 930 years of Adam's life. That Eve survived
Adam is generally agreed in apocryphal literature, hut the actual length of her widowhood is very variously stated.
166. The poet has misread .d.cccc.xii. in his authority,
substituting .xu. for the last letters. On the other hand, he has not docked Seth's life by three hundred years, as the
prose texts have done. The M text has altered the verse text to conform with the prose.
173. Jared's life was 962 years long. Here again .ii. has been misread as .u.
177. Most of the mss. agree on ochtmoga, but the variant
seclitnwga is historically correct.
182. Lamech's life was 777 (Hebrew) 753 (Septuagint). The figure in the text 775 and H's correction 757 are both
unauthorized. An owner of U has taken the trouble to look the matter up : see the footnote.
186. Adam's son Sile, and the three wives in line 188, reappear in Sex Aetates Mundi, but whence they reached that text I have failed to discover. Olla was Seth's wife,
Pip was Cain's, Pithip was Sile's. Evidently there is some
confusion between Seth and Shem, just as Cain and Ham (Cham) are sometimes interchanged. Pip and Pithip must therefore have some kinship with Oliva and Olivana, but the nature of the kinship is not clear.
193. On the names of these women see the note on the prose texts H 7.
205. On this quatrain and its mysterious geography, see the notes on the prose text ff 86, where we find the interesting back-formation Formenia > Armenia on the basis of ar < for.
212. D spells this word cubaat, and writes it thus (as nearly as can be represented in print) cub&ccc, the first two r 's being really a fantastic a. The same peculiarity was
1 robably also in yD, and has influenced E's cubatat. E was certainly not copied from D, but might well have come from



NOTES ON SECTION I. 267
VD- This is a good illustration of the way in which the
external form of the mss. and their handwriting may
sometimes give us some crumbs of information as to their relationship ; see ante, p. xxvii. It must be admitted that this peculiar way of writing a sequence of «'s and t's, in any combination, is a trick of Muirges 6 Maoil Conaire, the scribe of D, and that it reappears in the Book of Fenagh, another
of his productions. It is not, however, a regular habit : it looks more like an artificial affectation, in which he indulges whenever he remembers to do so, and he may have made it
his own after learning it from \/~D.
215. The cheville cen bron is more than usually meaningless here if we give to the word bron its ordinary meaning "sorrow.''' K. Meyer, Contribb. gives (with a query) an alternative meaning "burden" which helps slightly, but not much. But we need not expect a poet in metrical difficulties
to be intelligible all the time : our present poet is better in
this respect than many of his colleagues.
218-219. In both these lines the o of ro is metrically elided. Several of the scribes have failed to notice this, and have endeavoured to emend wThat they took to be the faulty measure of the rhythm.
221. I know of no authority for the extravagant dimensions here ascribed to the tower.
228. The list of the heroes of Nimrod's Tower agrees with that in Auraicept, except that Peleg and Rabiath (= Rifath) Scot are here omitted. Dardan appears in
Auraicept as "Bardanius." The names are selected, on some
random principle which it is futile to try to determine, from
a list of the immediate descendants of Noah ; with such
incongruous additions as Nabcodon, Latinus, and Longbardus.
The first of these comes from an Ogham alphabet of names : see Calder's Auraicept, p. 20, and also below, line 257.
240. The sense of the couplet seems to be "though God
be no respecter of persons—though the abbot and the king be
all one in His sight—mav He grant me the favour of a long life."



268 NOTES ON SECTION I.
251-2. These lines appear in the order as printed in all the mss., but as the tetrasyllable Ibitena should follow the trisyllable il-berla they should be transposed. The city of Ibitena is apparently an echo of the name of the Median city of Ecbatana. As the table of va/riae lectiones shows, this name assumes a variety of forms. Keating gives another
version, Eathena, and quotes this quatrain as from Cin Droma
Snechta—which seems to suggest that this poem was contained in that important manuscript.
257 ff. This is the Ogham-alphabet list of the chief persons of Nimrod's Tower, from -which one set of names for the Ogham letters was derived. For metrical reasons the alphabetic order has been disturbed (see for the proper arrangement Ca.lder's Auraicept, p. 20) and some of the names have been modified. Mored, Gad, Hidomus correspond respectively to Muiriath, Grotli, and Iudonius. Ordmor (possibly meant for Ord Mor, but the variae lectiones suggest that it is one word) corresponds to Ordines (Ordonus in M). Srti, the Stru of the Ogham list, has been lost from all the mss. except M; and additional names have been interpolated (Nenual, Gaedel, Cainan, Ionan).
VI.
Metre : debide scailte.
273. On the characters ascribed to the rivers in this poem, see the note on the prose H 28.
274. The name Nuchal here given as the fountain-head of the four rivers, can hardly be dissociated from Nuehul, given
as the name of an African river in the Geographical Poem of Eos Ailithir (P.R.I. A., xvi, p. 241). Its (probably erroneous) identification with the Nile, and the identification of the latter with Gihon, may have led to the transference
of the name to the well-spring of Paradise.
278. We must read felicitias for the sake of the metre.
284. I suspect that tibes is wrong, but I take it as I find it in the mss.



NOTES ON SECTION I. 269
VII.
Metre : debide scdilte.
VIII.
Metre : rannaigecht becc.
This quatrain, and the following poem, found in H only, are printed exactly as they appear there, with the addition of punctuation marks only.
IX. Metre : debide scdilte.
296. In this poem Nae has become a monosyllable ; a fact emphasised by the spelling of the genitive Naee in line 304.

IRISH TEXTS SOCIETY.
The Thirty-Fourth Annual General Meeting of the Irish Texts
Society was held on Saturday, nth February, 1933, in the Library
of the Irish Literary Society.
Dr. Robin Flower, chairman of the Executive Council, presided.
The Minutes of the last Annual General Meeting, held on the
13th February, 1932, were taken as read. Mr. Maurice O'Connell, Assistant Secretary, read the
Thirty-Fourth Annual Report
Duanaire Finn. The Council are glad to report that all the
poems and translations forming Part II of Duanaire Finn are
through the final proofs. Arrangements are now being made for
binding. This volume will be followed by Part III, consisting of
the Preface, Notes to the Poems, Glossary, and Index of Persons
and Places, etc. Both volumes are being edited by Mr. Gerard
Murphy, M.A. Part I, edited by Professor Eoin MacNeill, D.Litt.,
was issued by the Society in 1907, and is now nearly out of print.
Instructio Pie Vivendi (Holy Life and Heavenly Thought). The
first part of this interesting theological work is now nearing
completion. It will consist of the Latin original and Irish
translation, with a short glossary of the rarer Irish words. The
Irish is a very good specimen of the early modern language. The
work will be in two volumes, and volume, two is in active
preparation.
The Great Blasket. The Council regret that owing to illness,
the result of an accident while on a visit to the Aran Islands, Dr. Flower was obliged to suspend his work on this volume for some
time. He has now resumed. The volume will consist of a collection of tales dealing with the life of the Great Blasket Island, Co.
Kerry, in the nineteenth century. A number of poems by a poet
of the locality will also be included, with stories illustrating their subjects.
Note.-—Part II of Duanaire Finn was distributed in September of this year.



The number of back volumes disposed of during the year was 94.
The Rev. P. S. Dinneen's edition of the Society's revised and
enlarged Irish-English Dictionary is now nearly exhausted. The
Council have under consideration the question of a reprint.
During the year an edition of the Society's smaller dictionary
in Roman type was completed, and a new edition in Irish type
has also been printed. Both editions are now obtainable at 3/-.
The Council regret to report the deaths of the following : Right Rev. Dr. Shahan, Vice-President of the Society ; Lady
Gregory, Col. J. W. MacNamara, Dr. Goddard Orpen.
Members who joined during the year were : —Dr. Gerard Coyne,
Ballinasloe ; Miss Anna Irene Miller, Baltimore, U.S.A. ; Maire Ni Locain, Dublin ; Fergus Patterson, Putney, London ; Convent of
St. Louis, Monaghan ; Minnesota University Library, Minn., U.S.A.
J. C. Sprott, Esq., Glasgow, resigned.
The adoption of the Annual Report was moved and seconded.
During the discussion which followed, Dr. Joyce referred to the
slow rate of production of the Society's books. It was explained
that the delay in every case was occasioned by illness or pressure
of other business that obliged the editors to postpone their work
on the Society's volumes. On a show of hands the Report was
adopted.
The Financial Statement was explained by the Treasurer and
adopted on the proposal of Mr. Buckley, seconded by Dr. Joyce.
The re-election of the Officers and outgoing members of the
Council, Mrs. Banks, Mr. Buckley and Dr. Flower, was proposed
by Mr. O'Keeffe, seconded by Mr. FitzGerald, and carried.
A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. R. W. Farrell,
F.L.A.A., for auditing the accounts, and his appointment as
auditor for the year 1933 was agreed upon.

SECTION lY.—PARTHOLON.
208. Here is the Taking of Partholon. Now Ireland
was waste after the Flood for a space of three hundred
and eleven years, [or perhaps one thousand and two
years as others ,say] till Partholon reached it— [and
that is more correct. For Abraham had sixty years
comj)lete when Partholon took Ireland; that is, it was
nine hundred forty and two years from Abraham back to the Flood. Abraham's sixty years, along with the
forty, make one hundred. The hundred, along with the nine hundred, make one thousand, and there are two extra years : so that there were a thousand and two years from the Flood to the coming of Partholon to ![reland.] Moreover there were two thousand six hundred and eight years from the beginning of the world to the coming of Partholon into Ireland.
^G
Two thousand six hundred years, lacking two years, from
Adam to Abraham.

Nerua, Cicliba, Cerbnat, Delgnat were the four women,

of Partholon himself]. Here are the women of Partholon : Elg-nat wife of Partholon, Nerbgene the wife of Rudraige, Aife the wife of Laiglinde,

Poem no. XXXVIII.
211. Wouldst thou know wherefore Partholon came forth from his land, 'tis easy. Partholon slew his mother and his father, seeking kingship for his brother :
so he came to Ireland fleeing from his kin-murder. And so thereafter plaguings came upon him in his kin
murder. Xine thousand in one week died for the guilt of his [presumption and his K^] Idn-murder.
212. These were the chieftains of Partholon. Partholon himself, and Slanga and Laiglinne and Rudraige. His additional hireling, Ith. Their mves, lafe (= Aife), Elgnat, Nerhgen, Cerhnat. Tothaeht and Tarba, Imiis and Aitechbel, Cuil and Dorcha and Dam, the seven husbandmen of Partholon. Lee and Leemag, Imaire and Etirge, the four oxen of Partholon; and Beoil the steward of Partholon, he it is who first made a
guest ing-house. Brea s. Senboth s. Partholon, the first who made a house and a cauldron and duelling in Ireland.
IMalaliach moreover, the first surety and [the first] brewer, and the first who drank fern-ale : and it is he who invented oblation and adoration and sortilege. The three druids of Partholon,

215. Seven years after the Taking of Ireland by
Partliolon, the first man of his company died—Fea s.
Tortan s. Sru s. Esru, uncle to Partholon.
From him is Mag Fea named, and there was he buried, in Oilre of Mag Fea. Of him is
named "the first birth in
Laigen, " for there was he
born, on the hilltop.
and there was he buried, in Oilre of Mag Fea, and from
him is Mag Fea named.
216. The first battle of Ireland was in the princedom of Partholon, at the end of three years after the death of Fea. Where it was fought was in Slemne of Mag Itha,
against Cichol Clapperleg. On single legs and with single arms and single eyes was that battle fought, and it broke before Partholon. They were a week fighting it. It is said
til at not a man was slain there, for it was a magic battle.
In the third year thereafter was the first battle of Ireland, in the princedom of Partholon, in Slemne of ]\Iag Itha, against Cichol Clapperleg of the
Fomoraig, namely, men with single legs and single arms; to wit, demons with the forms of
men. They fought against him and the battle broke before
Partholon. A week were they fighting it, and not a man was slain there, for it was a magic battle.

217. For that is the battle in which not one man received a mortal
wound nor yet expulsion. According to another authority, it broke before
Partholon, and there Cichol s. Nil was slain, and his people were hard
pressed : and Partholon received a mortal woiind. Also that it was of the gory darts of those wounds that he died, after a long time following the battle.
218. That is called Seven-Taking, namely the Taking which
took under Cichol in Inber Domnann. Fifty men and thrice
fifty women was the tally of every ship of theirs, including Cichol s. Nil s. Garb s. Tuathach s. Uathmor from Sliab Emoir ; Lot Luamnach was his mother. Two hundred years had they
a-fishihg and a-fowling, till Partholon came to them, and fought the battle of Mag Itha; whence is it called Seven-Taking, Cichol was slain and the Fomoraig destroyed, id dicitur
Poem no. XXXIII.
219. Seven lake-bursts over the land of Ireland in the time of Partholon : Loch Mesea, wliieli first burst forth in the third year after the first battle. In the twelfth year after the coming of Partholon into Ireland,
the burst of Loch Con and of Loch Dechet ; in Connachta are they both. The year after that Slanga son of Partholon died, one of the four chiefs of Ireland who came with Partholon : where he was buried, was in the

thereafter, the burst of Loch Laiglinne in Ui mac Uais : Laigiinne son of Partholon, one of the four chiefs of Ireland, at the digging of his grave, it is then that the lake burst over the land, [namely Loch Laiglinne] . The
burst of Loch Echtra between Sliab Modurn and Sliab Fuait. When it was ten years later, the burst of Loch Eudraige, for what drowned him was the burst of his lake over him; from that is named Loch Rudraige in Ulaid.
Moreover in the same year, the sea-flow of Bren over land, and thus is that the seventh lake : Loch Cuan is its other name. For Partholon found not in Ireland before him more than three lakes and nine rivers. The three lakes are, Loch Luimnig and Loch Fodremain, upon which is Traig Li at Sliab ]\Iis in Muma, and
Findloch of Irrus Domnann. The nine rivers, Buas between Dal nAraide and Dal Riata, Ruirthech, [the river of Life], between Ui Neill and Laigen, Lui in

220. At the end of four years after the burst of Bren, the death of Partholon on the Old Plain of Elta of Edar. This is why it is called "Old Plain," for never did branch
or twig of a wood grow through it. Partholon died at the end of thirty years after his coming to Ireland. Ninyas s. Ninus s. Belus w^as in the High Kingship of the Orient at that time, for it is in the
R^B M
eighth year of his princedom last year of the princedom
that Partholon died—twelve of Zames that the death of
years (of) Semiramis, and Partholon occurred, on the Old eighteen (of) Ninyas, so that Plain of Elta, and it is thus those are the thirty years that clear that Partholon was not Partholon spent in Ireland. more than thirty years in Ireland.
Two thousand six hundred twenty and eight years
from the beginning of the world to the death of Partholon, and five hundred and twenty years from the death of Partholon to the plaguing of his people. For it is five hundred and fifty from the coming of Partholon into Ireland to the plaguing of his people.

Now it is in the Plain of Elta of Edar that Partholon died, of the venom of the wounds inflicted on him in the battle of Ciehol Clapperknee. This is why it is called Mag nElta [Plain of Flocks], for the birds of Ireland used to be sunning themselves upon it : for there was unbroken forest in Ireland then after the Flood.
Or it is from a woman it was named later, in the time of the sons of Mil, to wit Elta daughter of Oes s. Uindset of the Laigne,
221. His four sons divided Ireland into four iDarts : that is the first division of Ireland. Ireland remained so divided till the plaguing of his people. There came a
plague upon them on the kalends of May, the Monday
of Beltene; nine thousand died of that plague until the
following Monday, upon Mag Elta, five thousand and
four men and four thousand women, Avho weve dead
betAveen the two Mondaj^s. From that is the plaguing of the People of Partholon in Ireland.
Other historians believe that it was in the seventh year of the age of Abraham that Partholon took Ireland : for others say that it was at the end of two years after the passing of Moses over the Red Sea, and that Maspertius was then in the high-kingship of the world. Three hundred twenty and eight

[seven, B] years from then till the taking of Troy, and Tiitanes was high king of the world at that time. So that at the end of two years thereafter Nemed came to Ireland. But the first opinion is better, and more accurate.
222. Xow this is the solitary man whom we have mentioned, who escaped
from the Plaguing, to wit Tuan s. Starn s. Sera s. of Partholon's [father 's] (a) brother. [And learned me7i and writers of knowledge reckon
that it was after Ireland was taken by Partholon that Stara came into
Ireland]. And God fashioned him in [many] forms in many times, and
tliat man survived alone from the time of Partholon to the time of Findian of Mag Bile and to Colum Cille, so that he related to them the
Takings of Ireland from the time of C^ssair, the first who took Ireland,
to that time [of the saints and of Diarmait mac Cerbaill King of Ireland. I'or it is Fintan wlio arranged the settlement of the household of Temair for Diarmait after a long time following that, and from this it is clear
that Fintan was Tuan]. (6) And he is Tuan s. Cairell s. Muiredach Muinderg of the Ulaid.

224. Let us speak further of the names of the people of Partholon, and of their deeds of valour in Ireland. It was Partholon who possessed the four oxen, the first cattle of Ireland. Of his company was Brea s. Senboth s. Partholon by whom a house and a flesh
[-cauldron] and duelling were first made in Ireland. Of his
company was Samaililech, by
whom was made drinking of ale and paying of suretyships first in Ireland. Of his company was Breoir, by whom was
made a g-uesting-house first in
Ireland. As the poet said
We have already spoken of Partholon and of his own
children, and let us speak now of the people of Partholon and of their deeds of valour and of their general arts in Ireland. Partholon had the four oxen, who used to plough land in
Partholon 's time—the cattle
which he had, or rather, they are the four oxen of Partholon, For there was of his company Brea son of Senboth, the eldest of the chieftains of Partholon, by whom was first made a
guesting-house in Ireland, and flesh in a cauldron for guests,
and duelling. And of the company of Partholon was
Samaile the Gray, by whom was first made beer and ale in Ireland and suretyship first in
Ireland. And of the company of Partholon was Beoir, by whom was made a guesting
house first in Ireland.

225. And of his company were his seven husbandmen,
Tothaeht, Tarba, Eoehair, Eatachbel, Cuaille, Dorcha, Dam.
Of his company were the four [oxen] which used to plough for him, Leie, Leead, Imair, Eitridi. Of his company were his two ploughmen, Rimead the tail-ploughman and Tairrle the head-ploughman. Of his company were his two irons : Fead
was the name of the coulter and Fodbac of the share. Of his company were his three druids, Fis, Eolus, Fochmorc. Of hh company were his three champions, Milchu, J\Ieran, IMuinechan. Of his companies were his poet and his leech, Bacorp the leech and Ladru the poet, and it is they who first of all made guesting in Ireland. Of his company were his two merdiants,
Iban and Eban—Iban first got gold in Ireland and Eban got cattle and kine. Of his company were his ten^'') daughters, Aife,
Ainc, Etan, Ard, Macha, Mucha, Melibard, Crlas, Grennach, Anaeh, Achanaeh. Of the company of Partholon was this troop of champions, though they are counted to Nemed, and
it is said that they were sons-in-law of Partholon—Aibri,, Bronnad, Ban, Caerthenn, Echtaeh, Athchosan, Luchraid, Ligair, Lugaid. lender the Taking of Partholon was building first done in Ireland, and a quern, and churning, and ale. It is in the Taking of Cesair that sheep were first brought into Ireland. So that of the People of Parthalon, the historian
Eochaid ua Floind spake this songPoem no. XXXI.
226. Ajid it is of that Takings and of the route of Partholon from Mygdonia to Spain and from Spain to Ireland, that the following poem
gives judgement
Foem no. XXXII.
Moreover the following song, which we forgot, is applicable to the Pontine Taking of Partholon : and though we leave it here, it is not through
ignorance, for above where we lirst mentioned Tuan it ought to come : ut poeta dixit
Poem no. XXXIX. The Second Age, from the Flood to Abraham, nine hundred forty and two
years is its length. At the end of sixty years after that, Partholon took Ireland : five hundred and fifty years from the coming of Partliolou into Ireland to the plaguing of his people.

This is tiie First Age, from the beginning of the world to the Flood, 1656 years. The Second Age, from the Flood to Abraham, 292 j-ears, or 942 years, was its length : and at the end of 60 years afterwards, Partholon took Ireland : 550 years from the coming of Partholon to the Plaguing of his People.
228. The tally of kings that took the world at that time. In the Second Age were these deeds transacted : the Tower of Nemrod, and in it was taken the first lordship of the world
in Asia, which NINUS s. BELUS took. In the 23rd year of his reign was Abram born. The Thebans [Tefferus W] governed Egypt at that time ; 140 j^ears was the length of their lordship.

year of the age of Abram Partholon took Ireland. Abram survived over the reigiis of five of the kings of the world,
Ninus, Semiramis, Ninyas s. Ninus, Arius, Aralius. Now 175 years was the length of Abram's life. As for Ninus,

In the eighth year of the reign of Bellepares there came the plague of Partholon 's people. It is then that Hercules captured Troy. Sosarmus was king of the world at that time. Sixty years between the two Takings, that is 30 years after the plagiie till Nemed came, and 20 years after the coming of Nemed, till Troy was captured for the last time. Tautanes was then king :
720 or 630 years the seed of Nemed were in Ireland. A Saturday, on the kalends of August, Slanga landed in Inber
Slaine. A Tuesday, Gann and Sengann landed in Inber
Dubiglaisi. A Friday Genand and Rudraigi landed in Inber Domnann. In the end of the rule of the Chaldeans the Fir Bolg came into Ireland : Baltassar, the last ruler of the Chaldeans, was then king of the world. The kingdom of the Persians thereafter.

SECTION IV.—PARTHOLON. 39
232. More of the Taking of Partholon, of his route and of his adventures
from Mygdonia to Ireland. Wlien Partholon with his troop of eight
persons came to Ireland, and quested around Ireland close into the shores,
this was the fruitful place which he selected, to eat of the increase and
of the provender of Ireland—for neither houses nor husbandry were at
their service at that time; nothing but the hunt, the chase, and fowling.
The place where Partholon made his choice was at the river Da Eoond, for
that place is the most fruitful which he found in Ireland. The learned
consider that the plain upon which that place is situated was not shared
among the children of Partholon. Mag Inis was its name, and it is called Tradraige of Mag Inis, to which Oathbad the druid belonged.
233. For this reason is it called the river Da Econd ("of the two fools"); when Partholon went a-hunting and a-fislung, he left his wife
Elgnat [daughter of Lochtach(a)] and his henchman Topa to guard the
island. The woman bade the henchman pair with her, in despite of
Partholon. The henchman refused, and the woman said that the henchman
was a coward. At last the henchman consented to her, as the woman was
reviling him. From that indecency and folly which those two wrought,
the name clave to the creek from that time fon\'ard. Thereafter thirst seized them, and they drank of the measures [vessels] and [suction] -tubes of Partholon, such was the greatness of the thirst in the guilt of the misdeed which they had wrought. Partholon came to his house in the end of the day, and perceived the taste of Topa's mouth and that of Delgnat upon the tube, and so became aware of the misdeed; great wrath
seized him, and he killed his wife's lap-dog, which was called Saimer;
whence Saimer 's Island has its name. That, then, is the first jealousy that
ever was in Ireland, and of it Partholon said :
Great the tidings which ye have spread : Elgnat, ye have mocked us ; Many children of uncertainty. Of the face of lords a blushing ;
In the heart of champions a swelling ; Peace will not apportion them a quiet heart ;
Evil tidings which ye have plotted
A small thing will not recompense them for great jealousy : The practice of illicit love, How great is the disgrace !

234. Then Elgnat answered and said : Master, fair one, Partholon !
said Elgnat, when longing for pairing cometh, 'tis not easy to subdue it.
See thy speokle-coloured cattle-herds in their tight bond they have desire !
See thy sheep of f:dr garb that tarr}' not for a pairing-master ! See the lofty cattle of any particular man, they seek the covering-bulls against reason. See -white sheep, when their heat comes,
they go into the authority of any ram that is first
in the stalls.
A calf is in a bond that it follow not its milch-cow.
A hundred lofty planks upon lambs that the grown lambs suck not. Foaming milk of thy horned cow, be it not trusted to a kitten !
An axe ever-sharp, hard in protect, be it not trusted to a hewer !
Yet great is the shame which ye have wrought, woman, said Partholon,
and from the time when Eve wrought the sin of the apple, by which the human race was enslaved and was thrust out of Paradise, the like of the crime which you have committed has not been done. Wherefore Partholon said:
Great are your crimes of deliberation, your crime deserves penalties : ,
We ever protecting you, you dishonouring us. Enough for everyone are thy bad manners, seemly will everyone think thy guiltiness. The sins of Eve we have found Second to what you have done,
Delgnat, or yet more.
235. Great was the suffering that came upon Partholon over the sea
till he reached Ireland : so that of the adventures of Partholon and of
his route and of his adversaries the learned sang this
Poem no. XXXII.

236. All the folk of Partholon died then of plaguing, as we have said above, except one man, Tuan s. Starn s. Sera son of Partholon 's uncle.
God fashioned him in many forms, and he survived from the time of
Partholon to the time of Colum Cille, and revealed to them the knowledge and history and Takings of Ireland and her histories, from the coming of
Cessair until then. For this purpose God kept him alive till the time of
the saints. He was at last called Tuan s. Cairell s. Muiredach Muinderg : and these are the shapes in which he was : an hundred years had he in the form of a man, tliree hundred years in the form of a wild ox over
waste places, two hundred years in the form of a wild stallion, three hundred years in the form of a solitary bird, an hundred years in the
form of a salmon. So that a fisher took him in his net, and carried him to the queen, the wife of Muiredach Muinderg; so he was urged of her,
and of her was Tuan conceived at last. The learned say that he was
Fintan Fineolach. Of those shapes the learned sang this song

84 NOTES ON SECTION IV.
Partholon.
Notes on the Prose Text.
First Redaction.
^ 199. The interval between the disappearance of Cessair
and tlie coming of Partholon gave the synchronists much trouble. Here and in ^ 208 we have four different estimates,
of 300, 311, 312, and 1002 years respectively. The identification of the three landings in the mythical Inber Scene, which is comparable in name only with the Shannon estuary, is uncertain : the only other recorded in the book is that of the Milesians, so that "three" here is probably a mere mistake of the glossator's.
^ 200. The incident of a bursting lake is common in Irish mythology : in the version of the story of Ulysses called Merugud TJilix a lake bursts out of the perforated, eye of
Polyphemus! (ed. Meyer, pp. 4, 5). It is possible that the phenomena of the turloclis, temporary lakes, frequent in some parts of the countiy, may have had a share in shaping these stories.
Ui mac Cuais (or tjais) Breg is the region S.W. of Tara, but it contains no conspicuous lake to be identified with Loch
Laiglinne (but see Gwynn, MD iv 256 and notes thereon). Sllah Slanga has been identified with Slieve Donard in the ]\Iourne Mountains : for an expansion of the story connecting
the mountain with its eponym, see MD iv 300. Loch Ii'udraige,
according to ^ 203, is in Ulidia. It has been identified with Dundrum Bay, but if this be sound it was a mere name to the writer of the narrative before us, for that sea-bight could hardly have suggested to anyone the notion of a lake-burst
at the digging of a grave. See Gwvnn's comments, MD iv,, p. 455.
^201. There is no justification for 'Donovan's identification of Mag Fea with the barony of Forth, Co. Carlow.



NOTES ON SECTION IV. 85
Dindseiichus transfers it further west, apparently to somewhere in the neighbourhood of Slievenaman, and tells an
entirely different story of the origin of the name (MD iii 198).
^202. On the matter of this paragraph see the intro
duction to the present section. We cannot certainly identify the SUmna (''smooth lands") of Mag Itha, for there were
several plains so named—in the barony of Raphoe, Co. Derry ; to the S. of Arklow; and in the territory of the Dessi.
tl 203. Loch Cudn (aliter Brena lower down) = Strangford
Loch : MD iv 146 attributes its origin to Manannan. Loch
Dechet = Loch Gara, Co. Roscommon; Loch Mesc = Loch
Mask; Loch Con = Loch Conn; Loch nEclitra must have
been somewhere near Loch Mucknoe, Co. Monaghan; Loch
Fordremain = the river inlet of Tralee Bay; Loch Liiimnig is apparently the wide part of the Shannon estuary at the
mouth of the River Fergus ; Loch Cera = Loch Carra, N.W. of Loch ]\Iask. For the other lakes here mentioned see the note to tl 200. The "original rivers" are easily identified: the River of Life (dissyllable), now called Liffey after the
territory through which it runs, but properly called Ruirthech; Lee, Moy, Sligo, Erne, the Meath Blaekwater, Mourne, Bush, Bann. Quite probably these aboriginal prePartholonian waters were singled for special mention because
they were regarded as of special sanctity, presided over by deities of a cosmic antiquity.
^204. Mag nitha of Laigen is the plain of that name south of Arklow. Mag Tuired is probably the so-called Southern iMoytura, near Cong. 31ag Li bordered on the west bank of the Bann, probably in the northern part of Loughinsholin barony, Co. Derry : Ui mac Cuais (a different region from that mentioned in ^ 200) lay between Bir (the Moyola river) and Camus (Macosquin). Mag Ladrand in
Dal n-Araide is supposed to be the low maritime plain near
Larne. "The Old Plain of Etar" appears to be, primarily, the isthmus connecting Howth with the mainland, and the lands adjacent to it north of the site of the present city of Dublin; but it is not clear how far it extended northward and southward. If "Tamlachta" was in it, and if this is to



86 NOTES ON SECTION IV.
be identified with the present village of Tallag-lit a short distance south of Dublin (a mere unproved assumption or etymological guess, for which later writers like O'Clery and
'Flaherty are responsible), the plain must have extended south of the Liffey. The text before us gives us no evidence for the existence of a place-name based upon the catastrophe. The deforesting of plains must have been a necessary preliminary to land-reclamation down to a time sufficiently late to influence profoundly all the traditions of early occupations and early kings. It permeates the whole of this compilation.
|[205. We here notice the first of a singiilar series of
datings which are to be found throughout the compilation—• a meaningless mixture of exactitude and incompleteness. The day of the week and the day of the month are specified, but not the essential number of the year. It is most probable that these week- and month-datings were not mere arbitrary impertinences, but that they w^ere arrived at by some kind of calculation ; we need have no difficulty in supposing that some historian devoted his life to determining, at least to his own satisfaction, the w^eek- and month-days on which different events took place. It is, however, impossible to verify
his calculations. We might, for example, estimate from the synchronisms the leng-th of Partholon's stay in Ireland, and then check, from Tuesday, the 14th of the month of his arrival, to Monday, the 1st of May of the year of his death ;
but unfortunately the month of arrival is not specified. In any case, numbers expressed in Eoman figures are so liable to , corruption that no reliance can be placed upon them :
and in fact, R- gives different figures (1| 209). In order to give any sense to these chronological data, we must assume that the year-figures, by whatever era calculated, or however expressed, were specified in the margins of oo LG, in quasiannalistic form, and that at an early stage in the transmission of the text they were discarded by the carelessness of copyists.
As for Tuan, see, in addition to the introduction to this section, the remarks in Meyer and Nutt's Tlie Voyage of Bran,
ii, 76 ff. He passed through a series of transformations, the last of which was as a salmon which, being captured, was presented to the wife of Muiredach IMuinderg King of the



NOTES ON SECTION IV. 87
Ultonians, and eaten by her—whether in instalments or all
at once we are not informed. In consequence he was born again of her, and was thus counted as the son of the Ultonian
monarch. He reappears as an arbitrator among the "five elders" of Ireland who were called in to establish the affairs
of Tara (Eriu, iv, 126).
TJ206. This H is obviously out of place, for, notwith
standing the great authority of Professor Thurneysen, who
regards the enumeration of the sons of Partholon which it
contains as the original version of his family record, I
cannot see it as such. It seems to me to be a stray-away from the narrative of Nemed, and to have specified a division of the country, not otherwise recorded, among the sons of that
leader. The names look like corrupted versions of the names
of Nemed 's sons—•

If, as has been suggested (vol. ii, p. 254), the Partholon tale
originally ended mth U 205, the present ^ would then be a
Nemedian "follow-on"—originally in its appropriate place, but now isolated and surrounded by intrusive Partholonian
matter. We can detect the same quatemity underlying the list of four persons who survived the Flood, one in each of the four quarters of the world, set forth with a scepticism born
of orthodoxy in a set of verses quoted by Keating (1 v 4)Fionntain, Fearon, Fors, Andoid mac Eathoir. The
patronymic of the last-named links him with the Tiiatha De
Danann—a good illustration of the terrible muddle in which these traditions have come down to us.
The partition contemplated is by a line east to west, along the gravel-ridge called Eisgir Riada, which stretches from Ath Cliatli Laigen, the ford near Kilmainham where the Norsemen established the nucleus of the city of Dublin,
to A. C. Medraige (Clarinbridge, Co. Galway) : and a line north to south from Ailech Next, the hill near Derry on which stands the imposing fortress called Griandn Ailig, to Alien
Arda Nemid, the island of Cove in Cork Harbour. A



83 NOTES ON SECTION IV.
marginal note in B (opposite the corresponding ^ 223 in R^)
derives this incongruous paragraph from the Quire of Dniim Snechta, which as we have seen has also supplied disturbing material to the Cessair narratives.
^207. Here Partholon appears as a culture -hero, a conception greatly developed in the subsequent redactions. To him or to his followers is attributed the origin of cattle
keeping, building, cooking, duelling, intoxicant drinking,
suretyship, and guesting. The name Semhoth was presumably, in its original context, the genitive of an earlier ^Semib : it
has here developed a secondary genitive Senhotha. But it
seems desirable to follow the form to which the name had attained at the time when the text, as we have it, was written rather than to re\dve more or less theoretical archaisms.
Second and Third Redactions.
^208. On the chronological discrepancies, which the glossators of this TJ have endeavoured to settle by their laboured calculations, see the note to Ij 199. Thurneyscn (ZCP xiii 141) has suggested that Partholon may have seemed to the synthetic historians a suitable person for leading the
first post-diluvian iuA^asion, by reason of the (ridiculous) etymology for the name "Bartholomeus" given by
Hieronymus and Isidore—as though meaning, in Aramaic, flius snspendeniis aquas. There are hints pointing in this
direction : but the long space of time—on the lowest estimate
300 years—assumed by the historians between the Flood and his arrival, is not altogether favourable to the association suggested.
^209. The genealogies agree in making Partholon son of Sera : the discrepancies which follow matter little^. In a remarkable ''poem" of historical conundrums, attributed to
^ Sera-Sru-Esru are fixed by the ' ' Trismegistiis ' ' etymology already
indicated (vol. ii, p. 129). After this the pedigree diverges. If we might
connect Brament in some way with frumrnfum, one of the alternatives
would point us back once more to the corn-spirit.



NOTES ON SECTION IV. 89
the obscure Eochaid Ua Cerin (ed. Thurneysen, ZCP xiii 130), this parentage is said to mean "kin-murderous son"; sera
being equated to cera (one of numerous illustrations of the
early softening of the Latin c before i and e in Ireland) : this is doubtless an adaptation of the Greek K^ip, "fate, doom" as Thurneysen has noted (ZCP xx 378). Here we are introduced to the parricide story, the importance of which has been shown in the introduction to the present section. Midi must arise from a misreading of ^IKEAIA in some
list of Greek place-names. Meigint, in the R^ version, is doubtless Mygdonia, at the head of the Thermaic Gulf.
Grec Becc and Grec Scithegda are mere inventions, suggested by analogA' with the name Graecia Magim applied to the €rrecian colonies in S. Italy. Aladacia is presumably meant
for Dalmatia : the appended m betrays the influence of some
Latin text, though there is no reason to suppose that LP was itself originally in Latin : in any case, once forms like "Gothiam" became established in the parts of the compilation derived from Latin, analogy would spread them into the rest of the book. It will be noticed that in the passage
before us the quasi-accusative forms (in -inm) and quasiablative forms (in -ia) are used at haphazard. The remaining stages in the journey, Gothia and Spain, need nothing more than the obvious comment that the compiler neither knew nor cared anything about the relative position of those
regions in terrestrial geography. The stages of the journey are of artificial length, being alternatives of a month and nine days : the nine days from Spain to Ireland make the only point of contact between this itinerary and that of Cessair. In view of the probable meaning of the Partholon
story, the date of his landing—Beltene, the first day of
summer—may not be without significance.
II 210. Here we have the stock expression ochtar, which misled Nennius, applied to one of the expeditions. The
women now enter the saga. For the geographical details see
T 200 and the appended notes. The glossator's alternative
enumeration of Partholon 's followers, ten persons, is evidently
made up by the addition of Topa, the henchman, and the latter 's lawful wife Crebnat. The glossators, as we have

already seen, never waited to read to the end of the paragraphs before rushing in with the "truths" which they had to impart, nor did they trouble to consider whether those truths might or might not be contradicted a few lines lower down. This amiable trait is often of great though undeserved utility, for it hints at alternative stories, which
the orthodox " synthetists " had rejected. We have seen in. the introduction the significance of the equation
Partholon = Ith = Topa; equally valuable is the probable
equation Delgnat = Elgnat = Cerbnat. The appearance of Aife, as daugliter of Partholon and wife of (her brother) Ijaiglinne is a further contribution of value made by this
paragraph to the problems involved. On the magical importance of such brother-sister marriages, see Lord Eaglan, Jocasta's Crime, passim. Mag nAife is somewhere in Offaly,
near Portarlington, but it is impossible to identify with certainty the Inher CicJunaine referred to.
||211 introduces us to the important story of Partholon 's act of parricide, of which we have spoken in the introduction. It is what may be called a "germinal" paragraph, which tells the gist of an entire narrative in a few words : and was
probal>ly culled by the compiler from some brief historical
abstract. The coincidence that both D and E have a
dittograi)hy (see critical note no. 21), although neither of these manuscripts can be a copy of the other, is an indication of borrowing from some common source, which contained the error.
1|212 contains (a) a slightly different enumeration of Partholon 's family and (5) an expanded version of the "culture-hero" details already met with in |f 207. .\n interesting feature of the list is the association of cattle on equal terms with the human, or quasi-human, members of the
community. The names of these oxen are artificial, being all
place-names. Senlioth (or *Senub), whom we met with
already in ^ 207, has now become a son of Partholon. None of our texts recognize Breccan, eponym of Coire Breccain,
i'S a son of Partholon, though he is so described in MD iv 82.
The triplicity of druids, with significant names, is in a



NOTES ON SECTION IV. 91
formula afterwards elaborated into mere childishness; and
the ten daughters with their husbands are an intrusion from
some other source. Aife, one of these daughters, whom we learned to know in Ij 210 as wife of Partholon's son Laiglinne,
is presented at the beginning of the present H as his own wife
(ousting Delgnat, who is apparently passed on to Slanga) ;
at the end of the U she appears as wife of an unexplained Boan. The incorrigible scribbler sD has written in a blank space
at the end of this paragraph the words 3Iuirgis sin and in
left-hand margin .i. I Sc'un (i.e, in Scrivneoir).
^ 213. On the contents of this H, its personalities, and the obscure expression secMgabCiil see the introduction to this section. Inter Domnand has been identified with ]\Ialahide Bay north of Dublin.
II 214. The order and orthography of the names of the plains differ from those of the list in Ij 204. Mag nEthrige corresponds to, and is identical with, the Mag Tuired of that
list. That Ith cleared Mag nitha is new : it is to be remembered that Ith, like Topa, is a sort of re-birth of Partholon. It can hardly be a mere coincidence that two of these plains bear names identical with those of two of Partholon's
cattle.
U 215. Oilre or Oilri of Mag Fea is not identified : Hogan's
equation to Ullard, Co. Kilkenny, is based on 'Donovan's erroneous identification of I\Iag Fea referred to above (H 201, notes). The birth of Fea in Laigen (R^), and his relationshii^ to Partholon, cannot be reconciled with any of tlie presuppositions of the orthodox narrative : these must
belong to a different stratum of tradition. An entirely different story of him and his genealogical connexions is given
in Dindsenchus : see MD iii, p. 198.
^216-8. On the matter of these paragraphs see the introduction to this section.

annalistic scheme, paraphrased by the writer of the present paragraph. The datmg: was probably expressed by the
appropriate number of K's (= Kalendae), as in other annals,
to express a lapse of a definite number of years : one K for one year, ten K's for ten years and so forth. Simplifying
this arrangement, and reducing the chronology to an "era
of Partholon," the annals must have been drawn up in some
such way as this
Year 3—Fomorian invasion.
6—Loch Mesca burst.
12—Loch Con and Loch Dechet burst.
13—Slanga died.
15—Laiglinne died : Lochs Laiglinne and Eehtra burst.
25 —Eudraige died : Locli Rudraige and Brena burst.
29—Partholon died. (H 220.)
A year has been lost somehow in the calculation, for ^ 220 goes on to say that Partholon died in the 30th year of his occupation. The order of the list of rivers and lakes varies, but otherwise the later and the older lists agree, except that
the Bush (Buas) has accidentally dropped out. Findloch is the same as the Loch Cera of H 203, and the old name Ruirthech is here restored to the Liffey. 11220. On Mag nElta see Ij 204. The tradition as here preserved makes the Partholonians survive their leader for a very long time, and then die of the plague : other versions make him victim of the same plague. The harmonists have made no effort to reconcile the plague story with (a) their
chronological theories, and (&) the alternative story of the death from wounds inflicted in the battle with Cicuil. The latter is hardly consistent with his survival for 27 years after the battle; it is evident that this story comes from a source that knows nothing of the plague.
I^usebius (apud Hieronymum) gives us the following

NOTES ON SECTION IV. 95
—the 43rd year of Ninus being dated to the first year of
the era of Abraham, and the end of the reign of Zameis being in the 90th year of the same reckoning.
The figures in R-B are unorthodox. U 208 tells us that
Partholon came to Ireland in the 60th year of Abraham,
which according to the Eusebian Canons would be the 8th
year of Zameis or Ninyas. W makes this the year in which
Partholon died, but B here reads 18th year, and, as appears
ijnmediately below, that is what W should have had : but it
does not make Partholon 's 30 years any more possible. sM or
Lis authority seems to have re-examined the question, and worked out a sort of correspondence; for by making Partholon 's death coincide with the last (38th) year of Ninyas, lie thus gives him his 30 years. R^B attain the same result by working back into the reig-n of Semiramis, making the invasion take place in her reign. This, however, according to Eusebius,
corresponds to the 22nd year of Abraham. The matter is of
no special importance, except as indicating the many difficulties in which the chronological harmonizers found tiiemselves involved. For the scarcely coherent story of Elta d. Oes, see
MD iii 104, with the prose extract in the notes, ihid., p. 495. Oes is there called s. Etair s. Etgaith. Neither there nor elsewhere have I found any further details about "the birds sunning themselves."
^221 presupposes the four sons of Ij 206, though their names and the details of the division are not here recorded.
We now have the plague story with the date added : the place-name Tamlechta Muintiri Partholoin is adumbrated, but has not yet been fullv evolved. The dates in the appended glossarial matter are mere nonsense. Eusebius dates the end of the reign of Sparetus ("Maspertius") in 497 of the era of Abraham, the crossing of the R^d Sea in 505, and the capture of Troy in the year 836 of the era of Abraham.

^223 = R^ U 206. The note that the quartet were "not
the same" as the obviously identical persons among the descendants of Mil, and M's ingenious discovery that these four sons were born to Partholon in Ireland, thus supplementing but not superseding his orthodox sons, are
good illustrations of the desperate straits of the would-be harmonizers.
1j 224-5. Here again is a list of the "culture-hero"
companv of Partholon, showing interesting variants from the
preceding lists (Ij 207 R\ ^ 212 W). The names of the four
oxen, though slightly different from R^ are recognizable. Brea s. Senboth and Beoir are carried through, though only
W
tells us that the latter w^as Partholon 's steward. Maliliath or Malaliach has become Samaililech or Samaile Liath, which looks like the result of contamination with the name of the antediluvian M«AeAf//A as written in Greek characters. (Possibly the name was written pedantically in some approximation to Greek letters in '^R^, to the bewilderment
of s""MR^!). We have already seen other cases of confusion l)etween the Greek X and the Latin M. The connexion of this
person with religion and divination, again, is known only
to R^ The ploughmen of R^ reappear in R^ with the substitution of Eochair for Imus : in addition we learn of a head- and a tail-ploughman, who make their first entry in R^. The personification of the plough-irons is a very primitive trait, which appears unexpectedly in R^ : see also poem XXXI, quatrain 16. Here we are quite definitely in the presence of a rustic pastoral polydaemonism : these beings
are kin to the Roman animistic numina. Compare the
mysterious Eclietlus, apparently a personification of the ploughshare (f\'rAr;) who according to Pausanias" appeared en the side of the Greeks at Marathon. To the triplicities of druids and champions a leech and a poet are added, who challenge the claims of Beoir to the introduction of guesting : these two personalities are fused
into one in the enumeration of the household in poem XXXI.
The poet's name, Ladru, gives us one more link between the

NOTES ON SECTION IV. 95
Partholon and the Cessair story. Iban and Eban, the merchants of whom, once more, we first hear in W, appear in the poem as Bibal and Babal, and this fonn is adopted
by K. The ten daughters in R" are much as in R^ with trifling orthogTaphical and other variations. Greber is omitted from the list of their husbands, and indeed the relation between these people and Partholon 's family, as stated in R^ reads like an afterthought or an intrusive gloss.
The assertion that "they are counted to Nemed" comes from a careless reader of poem XXXI, quatrain 11, w^hich follows tlie enumeration of the sons-in-law, and contains an enumeration of certain different champions, correctly ascribed to Nemed. See the note upon the quatrain itself for the place which it holds in the poem.
II 226. Gahdil Poindide PartJioloin, a Taking of Partholon in Pontus, presumably refers to the incident of Partholon 's early life given in the introduction to this section : although
the allusion appears to betray some uncertainty as to the geography of Pontus.
^227-8. Professor MacNeill has shown that this forms
part of an early chronicle, once separately existing, and preserved by having been cut up and distributed through the text of R-R^ (see vol. ii, p. 240). It is based upon the synchronistic canons of Eusebius; but many of its facts
(using the word in an elastic sense) have suffered in transmission. Eusebius gives alternate durations for the First Age of
the world (2242, but according to the Hebrew calculation 1656) ; the text before us adopts the shorter figure. Eusebius also observes that the Second Age, from the Flood to the Birth of Abraham, according to the Hebrew time-reckoning
by "Jubilees" was 293 years, but by calculations from biblical
data he prolongs this to 942 years—a discrepancy sufficient to confuse any chronologer. Further errors meet us immediately, owing to the
historians having copied from one another without troubling
to verify their references. In |f 228, at critical note {^), a
glossator has evidently begun to interpolate the list of the
works of the Second Age which we find in full in M (^ 231).



96 NOTES ON SECTION IV.
On the data supplied by Eusebius, Ninus began to reign in the 32nd year of Aegialeus, king of Sicyon, and was thus 22 years on the throne when Europs succeeded to Aegialeus, who had reigned for 52 years. Abraham was born in the
43rd year of Ninus, and 22nd year of Europs. Evidently our chroniclers have become confused between these two
dates, making Abraham's 1st year = year 23 of Niyiiis, thus creating endless difficulties for themselves. Glossarial inter
polations, divorcing a king's name from the length of his reign, appear to be primarily responsible. The divergent reckoning of years from the Flood, already commented upon, has produced further uncertainty : to this are due the ambiguities as to the date and duration of the Partholonian occupation. The repetition of the statement about the Ages,
which follows, is doubtless glossarial. The reign of Ninyas is credited with 35 years, instead
of 38 ; that of Arius with 33 instead of 30, though B gives the correct figure as an alternative. Apparently the document was at one time in tabular form, and three units from the
former reign slipped into the latter, so that ' became
xxxu
xxxiii. Eusebius makes Abraham 100 years old at the birth of Isaac, and prolongs his life for an additional 75 years. This brings us to the 15th year of Xerxes, which is fifteen years before the end of his reign, not in that of Arailius. The
chronicler, in looking forward to discover the synchronism of Abraham's death, overlooked the change of king. Further errors, in the latter part of the list, are
Armamitres 16 years (instead of 38), Belochus 30 (instead of 35), and the transposition of JManehaleus^ and Spherus. Neither the Hicronyman nor the Armenian version gives any
authority for Ascaidias and Pantacer, interpolated by B after Amintes ; I do not know where sB found them. Atossa^-Semiramis is treated as a separate monarch by our chronicler; Eusebius tells us that she reigned for 12^ years

The eighth year of Bellepares ^ 615 of the era of Abraham :
the alleged capture of Troy by Heracles is assigned to 766
of the same era and the final capture of Troy to 856. No jugglery will reconcile these dates with the statements in the text.

The passage will be found in its original context in Book of Lecan, facsimile fo. 187r«, lines 16-37.^'^ The alternative name of Xerxes (Baleus^) is from Eusebius, but Abraham is there said to have died in the 15th year of his reign, not the third. The reigns of Arius (30 yeai-s) and of Armamitres (38 years) are correct : but the assignation of the death of Jacob and of Ishmael to his reign seems to be nonsense, as well as tliat of Sale. The latter, according to a calculation in the Armenian Eusebius, died 269 years before
Abraham. M continues the erroneous estimate for Belochus (30 instead of 35). The 51 of Baleus is extended by Eusebius to 52; Isaac died in his 18th year.

Tj 232-4. The independent heading prefixed to these paragraplis shows that they form a text apart from the rest.
It was borrowed from some special source by M or by V^^j
and does not occur elsewhere in the older LG prose tradition. It has, however, an essential place in poem XXXII, and certainly forms part of the original story, whose "ritual
pattern ' ' formula it makes perfect. K completely incorporates the story, which is only loosely associated with M's version, and gives it a special prominence. Except for the retoricc compositions, K's version is independent of M's, so far as the verbal expression of the narrative goes; it is a prose paraphrase of the stoiy as told in the poem. Another version
appears in DincUenchas, which differs in some respects from
either of the LO texts. The Damh ocJitair formula reappears at the beginning of
11 232, showing the affinity of the text with the LG tradition. But a different conception of the landing of Partholon is jsresupposed, cognate rather with some Dindsenchas tradition. According to this, Partholon came from Greece where his parents and brothers had been killed for their inheritance,^ and after many wanderings landed, not in Inber Scene, but at Inis Saimer, an island unidentified on the Saimer (Erne) Eiver. It must have been near the sea-coast, and Ess Da Eccond must be some waterfall or rapid at or near the mouth of the river : not necessarily to be identified now, for rapids and waterfalls are pow^erful influences in inducing
geographical changes. Partholon settled on the island, but \,-hile it yielded quarry for the chase he could g'et no fish, and hunted in vain for this addition to his fare until he reached Inher Muada, the mouth of the River Moy, which he found well stocked. The hero's hunt for fish is emphasised
in both of the LG prose texts.

appears to be the southernmost stretch of sea-coast in Co. Donegal, the plain lying between the Drowes and the Erne rivers.
Delgnat is again called "ingen Loehtaig" in MD iv 256. The difficult 7'etoriccs put into the mouth of the chief
actors, and preserved with greater or less accuracy by both
M and K, look like excerpts from a rudimentary drama such as some Thespis might produce f£ a/na^ijc; at a
Dionysiae festival. And once the comparison presents itself, corroborative analogies follow immediately. The golden cuislenn, which has no obvious meaning in tlie story as we have it, becomes the emblem carried by the (jxiWorpopoi
at just such festivals, the incident in w^hich it figures being
a bowdlerised description of some fertility-promoting hocuspocus of which it was the instrument ; and, as we have seen in the introduction to this Section, the killing of the dog becomes an obvious sacrifice. Frazer has collected a number
of examples of the sacrifice of dogs at such fertility-rituals, and also as surrogates for the king who would otherwise be
slaughtered.^ The slaying of Topa, who, it will be remembered, is a re-birth of Partholon himself, is quite orthodox in this connexion. It is interesting to note that in the Dindsenehas version (MD iv, p. 290) ''he was driven out to flee at random," till he w^as devoured by dogs and birds. In other words, he became the katharma, the scapegoat of the community, and he met the fate which was the
common lot of such unfortunates. A whole volume of The Golden Bough is devoted by Frazer to this aspect of primitive
fertility-rites. It is obvious that the retoricc attributed to (D)elgnat in
|[ 234 was primarily a fertility-spell, like the fishing-spell put
into the mouth of Amorgen at a later stage of LG. In the second retoricc of Partholon the reference to Eve is of course an interpolation; it presumably arose from some misunderstanding or misreading which it w^ould now be scarcely possible to reconstruct.

(4). The variae lectiones listed note (') in line 903, may be selected almost at random to illustrate a fact which a full
study of the different versions will put beyond questionthat although in this and the next section the prose of E^ and R^ is closely cognate, the verse of R^ shows a closer
relationship to R^, and specifically to F. The only possible conclusion to be drawn from this is that which we have
already insisted upon—that originally only the prose was written out, the verse being indicated by cues : and when the verses came to be written in full, the scribes did not
always take them from the same source. K follows R-. Glosses : 901. feclit da ttainicc fainni no aininerte dho. 902. ha lainn no ha hesgaidh leo an lem si7i. 903. ni Jiuaimh

quatrain referring to Fea, not found in any of the older
texts

which adds the information, for what it may be worth, that
Fea's death was due to violence, with the possible implication that he was one more of the succession of king-sacrifices which appears to lie behind the Partholon record. The next
two quatrains, 12, 13, are transferred by K to a place between 17 and 18. K's glosses on quatrain 12 are as follows : 933. toimhsidh A. toimsidh iat. 934. as cluach a ccomhanmanna cia do thaishenfadh sihh iat. 935. do lionator is na glenntaihh fo heandaih an talmhan; gehis A. gleann.

scanning rua{i)d as a dissyllable, and glossing Rudhraighe ar nach raihhe recht no dlighedJi, no ar nach hiodJi dlighedJi ar a gha, a series of strictures for which we seem to have no other authority. 940. Loch Con ar a mhit ealadha.

The diana metres, grouped primarily into diana senga and diana tronima, were those studied and practised in the first year of bardic education, and rewarded with a fee of the value of a saniaisc or three-year-old calf. The suggestion in the verse is, that every literary tiro writes in honour of the rivers specified. The diana senga are classed as dian airseng
(7^ + l^y d. iarseng (7^ + 3^) d. midieng (8^ + 7"), and a number of subordinate forms, for which, and for the corresponding subdivisions of the diana tromma, reference may be made to Thurneysen's Mittelirische Verslehre (Irische
Texte III, p. 1 ff.). I know of no other reference to the idea that the primaeval rivers are a proof and limit-record of the
Deluge ! (17) L's reading in 953, Sldne for sluinde, is probably the result of a recollection of the river Slaney. But it is inadmissible, as this w^ould not accord with the enumeration
of nine rivers. K glosses Samair A. Eirni aniu.

Metre : dehide scdilte. This poem seems to have stopped short originally at
quatrain 11. F does not possess the remaining quatrains
12-17. The first seven quatrains are in a uniform order in
all Mss. except that in F No. 4 follows No. 6. The explanation
of this is simple : 4 was omitted in \/¥ on account of the similar beginnings of the two consecutive quatrains 4 {Bo
ha Bheoir) and 5 {Ac Bro). It was then written in the margin,
and taken in by F into the wrong place. [In like manner sE, misled by the homoiotes Aife (quatrain 9)-Aidbli (quatrain

10), dropped the first of these and was obliged to insert it
afterwards in the lower margin.] In D the [supplementary] quatrains 12-17 are written upon a slip of vellum, measuring
6-2 X 11 inches, tipped into the gathering—12, 13, 14, 15 on the one side, 16, 17 with some all but illegible giossarial matter on the other.*' That this was also the case with some
of the parent mss. of our copies is suggested by the way in
which these groups are distributed. Thus V has the order
(1_7); (12-14); (8-10); (15-17); 11: the eleventh quatrain is kept to the end, as it obviously contains the conclusion of the poem. For, in a position at the end of the poem, there
would be some appropriateness in its list of Nemed's
warriors—it would then serve as an introduction to the Nemed section. But as an interpolation in the middle of the
composition it is altogether out of place. E has the order
(1-7); (15-17); (12-14); (8-11). The parent ms. of these copies must have had a loose slip with the additional quatrains, three on each side, similar to that which we actually find in D, tipped in (or more probably loose, as the copyists were not very clear as to the order in wiiich to take them) ; and of the original quatrains, 1-7 must have been on the left-hand page, 8-11 on the right-hand page. V^^^ has an arrangement similar to V, except that 11 comes between 10 and 15, showing that this group took the text of the poem from a ms. closely cognate to the V-group of E-. In all this we observe a further and very interesting illustration of the uniformity in outward aspect of the mss. of our text, of
which we have already seen several illustrations in the course of our study. The poem, as a whole, is omitted by K, but a selection of its quatrains (2, 3, 5-10, 12, 14, 15) has been made and worked up into a pasticcio along with

It is possible that some of them may be of use for lexicographical purposes, but for the elucidation of the passages to which they are attached their value is small. There is nothing to call for comment in the text, which merely repeats the matter in the relevant prose paragraphs of R^R^, with a few unimjDortant orthographical variations in the names. In 1024 Auach for Ablaeh may be noticed.
In line 1029, the reading of V larhcmen Fergus, corrected by an I sprs. to the n, must be derived from an exemplar which, like D, read larbanel nFerg-us. 1043. ^Vmong the wonders of Ireland there was a wedded couple living in the east of Clonard called Bablu and Biblu' ; but unfortunately

The names are similar to those of Partholon's merchants as preserved here and in the later tiexts, but no other connexion between them can be traced. Quatrain no. 17 presumably refers to the misdeed of Topa, and shows that, in spite of its loose connexion with the prose version of the text, the story is an essential part of the Partholon saga.

critical importance. Another copy is found in K. swelled hj additions from other poems into a composite "epic'' of Partholon's occupation. The quatrams of the present poem follow on in a continuous series, when the interpolations
are excised, in the order 1-11 (12 omitted), 13 (14 omitted),
15a, 16, 18, 20-22, 19, 23, 26. 17, 24, 25. In the older mss.
aU have 1-7, but only YBE have 8, 9 ; FB omit both, M omits S. It is hardly likely that these are interpolations; they are essential to the story. More probably some of the copyists felt qualms at copying this rather risque passage. Quatrain 10 then follows in all copies (and this certainly presupposes 9, if not 8 also). Q. 11 and 12 follow in this order in K^E^, reversed in R- : most probably 12 is an interpolation in R-, for that redaction has verse 13 not found
in the others, which duplicates it and occupies the proper
place after 11. \/K did not possess quatrain 12, and K gives the order 10, 11. 13. Q. 13 should therefore be numbered 12b. and 12 should be struck out of the R- texts. Q. 14 then follows in them all, and then comes 15 ; here again, as in the ease of 12, there are two versions 15a and 15b, of
which the latter is peculiar to R-K : on the other hand Rdoes not possess 15a. Q. 16 is peculiar to R-K, but 17 was
not known to cc R-. It has been interpolated in V. and in
K
it appears after 26. Q. 18, which follows 16 logically, is also peculiar to R-K; 19 is the variant of 18 found in R^R^ Q. 20, 21, 22, follow on, no doubt originally followed by 23 ;
but in R-K 19 has been interpolated after 22, and 17 after 19 in DE. Q. 24 is another interpolation, known only to
R-K. Q. 25, 26 follow in this order in R^, but are reversed
in R^R-K; 27 closes the poem in all versions. We have therefore two slightly variant forms of the poem, in which doublet-verses have been jumbled together without any undue anxiety as to the sense of the whole. The general independence of the verse story from the prose version in ]\I is obvious. Delgnat 's arguments about the
cat and the wright are, of course, paraphrased from the retoriccs which (^vith whatever other now lost matter was originally associated with them) underlie the story as we
have it. But K's prose version is clearly a paraphrase of

the verse story, and does not depend upon any earlier prose
text. There are not many points calling for special notice. In 1065 Cappadocia is substituted for the Aladacia of the prose.
In 1067 the Latin accusative Goithiam reappears, once more indicating that the story has been versified unintelligently
from a Latin original. In 1072 we again see the inevitable ochtar. The much-married Aife appears once again in 1076. with a new husband, Fintan. As he does not figure in the
official list of Partholon's sons-in-law, we must here be on the track of a harmonistic legend seeking to bring about a combination of the Partholonian with the Cessair story.
1082. The cheville ingnad anaiclinig has already come in our way in preceding volume, line 756. 61 ngiiala (1107) : the expression has been discussed by Professor Thumeysen (ZCP viii 65) wdth the unsatisfactory result that it is a
stock expression, which doubtless meant something to the unknown person who used it at the first, but which has been copied from story to story by writers
who had quite forgotten, if they ever knew, what that meaning was. It can be, and usually is, translated "coaldrink," which is such utter nonsense that it condemns itself. "We can use it only as a mere demonetized coin. 11371141. The irresistible attraction of honey for women, here
alleged, reappears as a motive in an Abyssinian legend, otherwise quite unrelated to the narrative before us, of which a convenient abstract will be found in Seymour's Tales of King Solomon, p. 156 ff. 1156. Corad na Finngaile, "the "Weir of Kin-murder," does not appear to be identified. The
name implies kinship between Partholon and Topa.

from Adam's race, in that weird monument of human folly called Tenga Bith-nmi. There we read of The Tribes of Ithier, north of Mount Caucasus, whose mouths are in their

INTRODUCTION. 115
SECTION V.
Nemed.
Introduction.
The Partholon story, with which the Fir Bolg story is
cognate though not identical, seems to be essentially a kind
of pre-Celtic theomacliia. The Nemed story, which is more
nearly akin to that of the Tuatha De Danann, seems to
partake of a similar character. The Tuatha De Danann
story is, however, more of the nature of a tlieogonia, and it
refers particularly to the Celtic gods.
The "Celtic" connexions of the Nemed stoiy are shown
by the name of the leader. He is distinguished as "holy"i.e., in the sense of the Latin fas, one privileged to enter
religious assemblies. The divine name of the Tuatha De
Danann is consonant with this. On the other hand Nemed 's father, Pamp, or Pam, is a purely artificial adaptation of the
Roman name Pompeius. A person, presumably one of the Irish colonists in Wales, or more likely a Briton who had associations with those colonists, and who bore this exotic name, was commemorated by an Ogham-inscribed monument at Kenfiig, Glamorganshire. But the essentially religious element in the story has unfortunately caused its editors to sharpen their scissors :
and so far as possible they have assiduously cut out everything which savoured of the paganism with which the story must
have been originally charged. In fact, they have re-written the tale on the comparatively harmless lines of the Partholonian section, so that the two groups of stories now look like doublets of one another. The first Redaction tells of the ancestry of Nemed, his voyage on the Caspian Sea (an open gulf) for a year and a half, and his shipwreck
(]\ 237) ; he has four sons, one of whom is eponymous of one
of four lake-bursts {^ 238). He fights vdth the Fomoraig, who



116 SECTION V.
are defeated (t| 239), clears the timber from 12 plains (Tj 240), fights again with and defeats the Fomoraig (Ij 241) who,
however, oppress and exploit his people, after his own death from plague (Ij 242). These, once more, fight against and subdue the Fomoraig, but the tables are turned by belated, reinforcements under an unexplained leader. More son of Dela, and the Nemedians are dispersed out of Ireland (^ 243) into several regions (^ 244-245). This summary would almost serve as a summary of the Partholonian section. To the meagre details of R^ R^R^ (which, as in the
preceding Section, here run together) add : 1[ 248, the story of the golden tower ; ^ 249, the names of the women, including [the goddess] Macha ; Ij 257, the names of the refugees, with further particulars about their fates ; and ^ 262 ff., the return of the refugees to Ireland. Some further interpolations, of no particular importance, appear in M, and both Redactions add the synchronistic matter in continuation of that in the
preceding Section. The only really important details which survive are the incidents of the towers. The towers differ in character, but
the stories are the same. A fortress at or upon the sea is
assaulted; the tide rises on the assailants, unperceived by
themselves, and they are almost all drowned. Such a story must have been a familiar commonplace in
Celtic folklore. For it escaped beyond the Celtic circle, and,
becoming known to observers from the "Classical" lands, started a curious idea that the Celts would take arms against
the flowing tide, and feared not the rising inundation.^ We can hardly accept this as a literal truth told of actual people : but it might easily have been told, in a ''story" form, more or k^ss on all-fours with these Nemedian narratives. Though the tale has no doubt been coloured by recollections
of actual destructive assaults, it cannot be taken as historical. It is an incident in the eternal conflict between gods of light
and goodness and gods of darkness and evil. The story as
"Aristotle, Nicli. Ethics, iii, 7, 7; Strabo, vii, 2, 1. But see the
essay on "The Boldness of the Celts" in E. S. Hartland's Bitnal and Belief, p. Ifil. where many parallels are quoted and a different interpretation is put forward.



INTRODUCTION. 117
told in the Nemedian narrative belongs to a later and less unrefined stage of society than the Partholonian version : the Fomorians are no longer the grotesque monsters depicted in the Partholonian story. They are, however, none the less
cruel, and they demand what are obviously sacrifices. The
produce of the fields, the byres, and even of the human family
must be sacrificed to propitiate them. Just as on the plain
called Mag Slecht, down to the time of St. Patrick, human and other sacrifices were offered to secure the continuity of harvest produce, so on the plain called Mag Cetne a similar tribute was paid, and in an equal assessment of two-thirds. And is it a mere coincidence that, in this artificiality manipulated history, ]Morc, the Fomorian leader, is labelled with a name which, written backward, spells Crom, the alleged name of the god of Mag Slecht? It is not improbable that the drownings in the rising tide
are also reminiscent of sacrifices : victims having been bound upon the shore below the tide-mark and left there to be eng-ulfed. It is also just conceivable that another Floodlegend reminiscence may underlie this group of tales.
Micheal O Cleirigh, the compiler of K, has enlarged upon this tale of the assault on Conaing's Tower and, apparently sua sponte, has introduced an embassy sent for reinforcements
to Greece, which are obtained. These include a number of
wild venomous beasts, and a female spy called Relbeo, who enters the Tower, insinuates herself into the confidence of Conaing by methods similar to those followed by Judith in
dealing with Holofernes, and afterwards reports to the Nemedians the conditions inside the Tower, and advises them as to the strategy to be followed in attacking it. These absurd additions are quite without authority, and their only value is as danger-signals to warn the scientific enquirer to
use a prudent caution in approaching ]\Iicheal O Cleirigh and all his works. Even in his lifetime his superiors objected to his habit of tampering with his texts.
It is of little importance to enquire whence he obtained these embellishments. He lived too early to become acquainted with the Thousand and One Nights, else might we suspect that the story of "The City of Brass" (nights 566-578) had provided him with the venomous fighting beasts.



118 SECTION y.
An interesting- parallel, which seems to have escaped notice in print, may be quoted. In that queer eighteenth-century lepado-temacho-selacho called Eachtra Lomnochtdin an tSleihhe Riffe, we read of a monstrous bird called ''An
Liath-chaiTaig. " Obviously this is the old friend of our childhood, the sailor Sindibad's roc : the author, or rather the cook, of Lonmoclitdn must have borrowed it from some vanished chapbook adaptation of Galland's French version, w^hieh first introduced the "Nights" to Europe, mixing it
up in his stew with all sorts of things, including snippets from Gulliver's Travels. His rendering of the bird's name reminds us of the effort of the Highland exegete who explained the biblical phrase "They were astonied" by Bha iad air an
clacJiadh : or of the preacher whom I myself once heard
exliorting his hearers to keep in the caoi dhireacli—meaning, as the context showed, ''the strait way."
The earlier texts, and Keating, know nothing of Relbeo : but Keating has borrowed from Dindsenchas another woman, one Liag, who, though a sister of More, has a genealogy all
to herself, and who aids in collecting the tax imposed upon the Nemedians. In Dindsenchas (MD iv, 246) she is represented as being the first person to be killed on the Fomorian side. It is probable, as Dr. Gwynn remarks, that she was invented to account for the place-name Lege, the subject of the poem in question : but it is remarkable that Lege, a place lying between the counties of Kildare and Leix, should thus be associated with a narrative essentially localized in the West of the country. Since the publication of 'Flaherty's Ogygia, it has been
a commonplace to identify Toirinis, the site of Conaing's Tower and the scene of the Fomorian defeat, with Tory Island, north of Donegal. The identification was attacked by Mr. Henry Morris- in 1927 with great skill, and he brought together a very impressive mass of evidence, historical and topographical, for identifying it with a small island off the Sligo coast called Dcrnish. In fact, his paper comes as near to carrying conviction as such a paper well
can do. This, of course, has no bearing on the historicity

INTEODUCTION. 119
oi" the narrative : it means only that an amalgam of mythological and ritual tradition was re-modelled into a narrative form by persons familiar with this particular part of the country, and by them adapted to the topography with which they had the fullest acquaintance. The Nemedian story begins and ends with an assault upon
a tower. Now the parallel Tuatha De Danann story shows us the reign of Nuadu, the great god who was their leader, beginning and ending with a battle on a place or places called Mag Tuired, 'Hhe Plain of the Towers." This cainiot be an accident : the two stories must be different aspects of the same body of folklore. It is useless to attempt to identify the sites of the battles called Mag Tuired : they are as
mythical as the Battle of the Frogs and the Mice. Two extensive fields of megalithic monuments, one near Sligo and the other near Cong, have appeared to add local habitations to the name; but this is illusory. These monuments belong
to prehistoric cemeteries, and there is every reason against identifying them with battle-memorials. Individual burial even of the most important of the victims of a battle, with great stone monuments for each one separately, would clearly
be impracticable.

Agnomain of the Greeks of Scythia came thither, with
his four chieftains; [they were the four sons of Nemed].
Forty-four ships had he on the Caspian Sea for a year

the milk of the people of Ireland (had to be brought) every
Samain to Mag Cetne. Wrath and sadness seized on the men of Ireland for the burden of the tax. They all went to fight
against the Fomoraig. They had three champions, Semul s. larbonel the Soothsayer s. Nemed, Erglan s. Beoan s. Starn s. Nemed, Fergus Red-side s. Nemed. Thirty thousand on sea, other thirty thousand on land, these assaulted the tower. Conand and his progeny fell.
243. So, after that capture, ]\Iorc son of Dela came upon them, with the crews of three-score ships, and they fell in a mutual slaughter. The sea came up over the people of Ireland, and not one of them fled from another, so severe was the
battling : none escaped but one ship, in which there were thirty
warriors. They went forth, parting from Ireland, fleeing from the sickness and the taxation : Bethach died in Ireland of plague ; his ten wives survived him for a sjDace of twentythree years. Ibath and his son Baath went into the north of the world. Matach and Erglan and lartach, the three sons of Beoan, went to Dobar and lardobar in the north of Alba.
244. Semeon went in the lands of the Greeks. His j^rogeny increased there till they amounted to thousands. Slavery was
imposed upon them by the Greeks : they had to carry clay upon rough mountains so that they became flowery plains. Thereafter they were weary of their servitude, and they went in flight, flve thousand strong, and made them ships of their bags : [or, as The Quire of Druim Sneehta says, they stole the pinnaces of the king of Greece for coming therein] . Thereafter they came a-gain into Ireland, their land of origin : that was at the end of two hundred and thirty years after Nemed. These are their five chiefs, Gand, Genand, Rudraige, Sengand and Slaine.

to it. For of the progeny of Eifath Scot is every Taking
that took Ireland, except Cessair. At Sru s. Esrn the
relationship of Partholon and Nemed and the Fir Bolg
and the Tuatha De Danann and the sons of Mil of
Spain unite/ ^^ And each of these peoples had the
Scotic language : this is e\ident from the story that
when Ith son of Breogan came into Ireland, and he and
the Tuatha De Danann conversed, it is through Scotic
he conversed with them and they mth him : and they said that they were of the seed of Bifath. Others say
that Nemed was of the seed of the son whom Partholon left in the East, namely, of the seed of Agia son of Partholon.
248. He came out of Scythia westward, voyaging on the Caspian Sea, till he came in his wandering to the
great ocean in the north. His tally was thirty-four
ships, with thirty in each ship. There appeared to them a tower of gold on the sea, and they all went to capture it : and all were drowned except the Nemed-octad.

Such was the greed for the gold that took hold of them
that they did not perceive the sea raging around them;
so that the eddy took their ships from them except one
boat, Avhich carried Nemed and his three sons together
with him : and it is they who protected the women. Nenied then was a year and a half thereafter a-wandering, tiU they came to Ireland thereafter.
249. As for Nemed, there were four leaders, Starn,
larbonel the Soothsayer, Fergus Redside, and Annind, [who were the four sons of Xemed]. Their four wives
were Macha, Meda, Eua, Cera : [and Xemed was not included thereafter in the reckoning of those four men].
250. There were four lake-bursts over land in the time of Nemed : Loch Cal in Ui Niallain, Loch Munremair in Ui Luigne of Sliab Gruaire; at the end of nine years

that the lake burst over land. But Macha wife of Nenied died earlier than Annind; in the twelfth day [in R^

Ruibne, and Rodan were their names. And they were
slain in Daire Lige by Nemed before morning, before they should improve upon their digging.

255, There was a great oppression upon the children
of Nemed
at the hands of the Fomoraig after him in Ireland, avengat that time, after the death ing those three battles npon of Nemed, his seed in Ireland,
namely at the hands of More son of Deled and of Conaind son of Faebar,
who was in the Tower of Conand : and that is Torinis
Cetne today, over against Ireland in the north-west. In
it was the great fleet of the I'omoraig. This was the
oppression : they made a sheepIrnd of Ireland, and none v/ould dare to let smoke be seen from a honse in Ireland by day, at that time : also twothirds of their corn, their milk, and their progeny to be brought to them in taxation. The men of Ireland had to
convey this every Samain night to the Fomoraig, to Mag Cetne.
from whom is Conainn's
Tower, against Ireland, northwest, to wit Torinis. There the great fleet of the
Fomoraig was, lifting the
tribute of Ireland. Now this was the tribute : two-thirds of
the progeny, the corn, and the
milk, of the men of Ireland, to be conveyed to them every Samain night to Mag Cetne.

258. Beothaeh died of plague in Ireland: his ten wives survived him for a space of three score years. Ebath and his
son Baath went into the north of the world. Mathach and Ero-lan and lartacht, the three sons of Beoan s. Starn, went to Dobar and lardobar in the north of Alba. Thereafter Semeon went into the lands of the Greeks.
259. As for Semeon, [s. larbonel the Soothsayer s. Nemed] he went into the lands of the Greeks.
His progeny increased there till they amounted to thousands.
Servitude was imposed upon them by the Greeks—carrying of clay on to bare rocks, so that they were all plains under clover-flowers. Sad and vexed were they at the servitude, and they came in flight, five thousand upon the sea, and made them barks and ships of their bags.
Or it is the pinnaces of the King of Greece that they took with
them by stealth, to come into Ireland, as the Quire of Druim Snechta saith.

kingship of the world—the seventeenth king of Assyria : it is in his period that Moses died, as well as Tat son of Ogamain. In his period the Fir Bolg came to Ireland, and in his period the Gaedil were expelled from
out of Scythia : Agnon son of Tat was their leader and Boamain was in the kingship after him.
261. And they arrived at Ireland, at their ancestral home, at the end of two hundred years after the Taking of Conainn's Tower, Or two hundred and thirty.
262. The Fir Bolg and the Gaileoin and the Fir Domnann came into Ireland : for although a diversity of names is reckoned to them, they are
fundamentally one Taking—the progeny of Beothach son of larbonel the
Soothsayer s. Nemed. Now they were called Fir Bolg from the bags
of clay which they used to place upon the bare rock-flags; and Fir
Domnann from the deepening of the clay upon the bare rock-flags : and
Gaileoin from the javelins of wounding that they had, as they were
digging the clay. Or they were called Fir Bolg because they obtained a
noisome territory in Greece from the King of Greeks, full of venomous
leptiles, and the protection against the reptiles which they made was to
carry witli them clay of Ireland in bags : so that they were Fir Bolg,
from the bags of clay which they carried vnth them in their canoes.
263. They brought five leaders with them, Gann, Genann, Rudraige, Sengann and Slaine, the five sons of Dela s. Loth s. Tat s. Tribuat s. Athorb s. Goscen s. Airthecht s. Semeon s.

Domnann, ' ' from the deepening of the earth in the bags. And ' ' Gaileoin ' -*
from their digging; and it is of the seed of Nemed they were on all sides.
Others say, [the Tuatha De Danann,] that they were of the seed of
Beothach son of ' ' lardanaines, ' ' that is of the people of Nemed belonging to the party who went to the east to seek the maiden: for they captured
her, and made a great feast in the east, till their grandchildren and great
grandchildren came afterwards, [at the end of a long time]. Now such
was the greatness of their knowledge, that they came without ships or
vessels, and lighted upon the mountain of Conmaicne Rein in Connachta.
268. Others say that the Tuatha De Danann were demons of a different order, and that it is they who came from heaven along with the expulsion
by which Lucifer and his demons came from heaven; having taken an
airy body upon themselves to destroy and to tempt the seed of Adam.
That is the fortress against which those who made that attempt advanced, in the train of the devil and his followers. So those people go in currents of wind. They go under seas, they go in wolf-shapes, and they go to
fools and they go to the powerful. Thence comes it that this is the
nature of all of them, to be followers of the devil. No genealogy of those
people goes back; nor are they recognised as men of the world in general;
and all that multitude broke out against the righteousness of the Sons of Mil and against the people of the faith of Christ.
269. But in the book De Subternis, others say that the Tuatha De Danann were poets of the Greeks, and that it was their power that they should sail together on the seas without vessels. Besides being prophets
in the world according to their true inheritance, they were comnmnities
of kings and clans. These are the names of those who accompanied the
Tuatha De, Delbaeth and Elathan, Bres by whom was fought the battle
of Bres, that is the battle of Mag Tuired against the Fomoraig, and
Dagda and Lug Lamfhada himself.
270. . . . fight against the children of Nemed, and crush your enemies
traly: behead them and scatter them in revenge for your brethren and friends all, who have died at their hands. It is then [arose] that sea-host at the ferocious incitement of More s. Deled, and the men of Ireland and the children of Nemed arose in the same fashion. Then a battle fierce and reckless was fought between them. The wrath and anger of each man was heavy against his fellow; such was the sternness of the combat in which on both sides they were fighting, that it was not attained by one of them to have his mind on any other matter in the world but on the matter of fighting and combat.

at all, till the rushing rough flooding of high tide, the wave-breast of the
blue-topped stormy flood-tide came over them, so that not a man of them
escaped except the people of one ship of the Fomoraig, and thirty warriors
of the Children of Nemed. The people of that ship returned to the land
from which they had come, and told their tale from beginning to end, and the remainder of the Fomoraig were down-hearted at that news.
^o
271. But as for the thirty warriors who escaped of the children of
Nemed, they divided Ireland into three parts. The three chieftains whom
they had (were) Beotach s. larbonel the Soothsayer s. Nemed, and Semon
s. Starn s. Nemed, and Britan Mael s. Fergus Lethderg s. Nemed. Now this was the third of Beothach, from Toirinis of Mag Cetne, the place
where Conaing's Tower was captured, and where that battle was made, to
Boand the female-formed of the hundred harbours. The third of Semeon from Boand to Belach Conglais: the third of Britan from Belach Conglais to Torinis of Mag Cetne, in the north of Ireland. Beothach was the
first to empty Ireland, and the land, where they came in the world first, ii in the north east of Great Lochlann, and therein they learned prophecy
and druidry and magic and knowledge of every poetic art that was m the world. So they came thence into Graecia MagTia, and after it thej' came, after having mastered many arts, on the track of their father and
their grandfather to Ireland : and those were essentially the Tuatha De Danann. Britan Mael s. Fergus Lethderg, he settled in Moin Conain
meic Faebar. As for Semeon, he went into Graecia Magna,
and every seed born of him was reduced to servitude by the Greeks, so
that from Semeon were born the Gailioin and the Fir Bolg and the
Fir Domnann. Those are the relics that were left thereafter in Ireland, andl did not go with them from Ireland. The first attack on Ireland was
made by them after great fatigue, namely the Battle of Loch Sentuinne which is called Loch Febail now: and there was killed Febal s. Find s. Firmend, and from him is the lake named; and the battle of Mag Glas
in the land of Bres s. Eladan, which is called Mag Tibra to-dlay; from
Tibir d. Cas Clothach of the Tuatha De Danann is Mag Tibra named^
where Glas s. Rigbard s. Fer Bend fell, king of the land, from whom Mag
Glas is named. And from that out there follows the battle-rout of the
Tuatha De Danann against the Fomoraig. And of this story Fland the poet sang this song, to commemorate the story, Togail Tuir Chonaing
congail, etc. Finit of the Capture.

distaff he came, and a withered hag was made of him, so that he burnt
himself in fire : 470 years from when Xemed came till the end of the

274. After the rule of Assyria, the Amazons had the rule for a hundred
years, and they had six queens during that time, Marpesia, Lampeto, Sinope,
brithjda, <Antiope>, and Penthesilea. In the history of Dares
<Phrygius> it is related that Penthesilea was on the side of the Trojans
in fighting against the Greeks, so that she fell by the hands of Pyrrhus
son of Achilles. If it was Tautanes who was king at the time of the capture of Troy, Penthesilea was contemporary ^N-ith the Assyrians : or
Troy was captured in the time of the Amazons.

277. Now this is the princedom of the Medes : 45 years, and Ireland
was desert during their lordship. After the lordship of the Medes the Ohaldeians had it, but they are never reckoned as high lords,
NABUCHODONOSOR, 7 years.
and his son EVIL MERODACH, IS.
and his grandson NERIGLISSOR, 30.
and his greatgrandson LABASHI-MARDUK, nine months.
and his great-great-grandson BALTASSAR, 17.
Those are the five kings of the Chaldeans; 105 years all but three
months is their princedom. The four score and five years that the Medes
were in the kingship while Ireland was desert, and the 105 years that the
Chaldeans had, those make the 200 years that Ireland was waste from
the taking of Conaing's Tower to the voyage of the Fir Bolg. So that
in that manner the Taking of Nemed is concluded. [And anent that

190 NOTES ON SECTION V.
Nemed.
Notes on the Prose Text.
First Redaction.
^237. That Starii and his brethren were the four sons of Nemed is stated twice. In accordance with a principle already laid down, the first statement must be removed as glossarial. It seems to have been a favourite device of our historians to reduce the number of the invaders by wrecking
all their ships except that containing the leader !
^238. Locli Cdl in IJi Nialldin = Lochgall, barony of
Oneilland, Co. Armagh. Loch Muinremair = Loch Ramor,
Co. Cavan. LocJi iiDairhrech = Loch Derryvaragh, Co.
"Westmeath. Loch nAnnind = Loch Ennell, Co. Westmeath. Probably this lake-name has induced the substitution of Annind among the sons of Nemed for whatever originally corresponded to the Feron of the list in ^ 206.
^ 239. Bos FroecJidin, otherwise Badgna, is placed at or near Slieve Baune in the S. of Co. Roscommon. The appearance of Gann and Sengann as Fomorian leaders is a valuable illustration of the shifting nature of the traditions upon which Liher Praecursorum is ultimately based; and is not so surprising as the fact that harmonizing redactors have allowed them to stand without comment. Of the two forts enumerated in the paragraph, all that can be said is what we are here told about them, that one was in Island Magee (Semne) and the other in Oneilland barony. Daire Lige is not identified. Killing slaves to prevent the leakage of technical, military, or economic secrets is a commonplace of
human history. Ptolemy Imew of a people somewliere in the N.E. corner of Ireland called Bohogdii, and it was suggested
long ago (G. H. Orpen, Journal R.S.A.I., 1894, p. 117) that there may be some connexion between this name and Bohoc. The other four names might in that case denote communities



NOTES ON SECTION V. 191
which, being inland, did not come within the purview of Ptolemy's informants.
\\ 240. Mag Cera is equated to the barony of Carra, which
surrounds Castlebar in Co. Mayo : Mag nEha is the maritime plain west of Benbulbin : Mag Cuili Tolaid is in the barony
of Kilmaine, S. of Co. Mayo : Mag Luirg stretches south of
tlie Curlew mountains, Co. Sligo, Mag Seired, the plain
surrounding the tow^l of Kells, Tethba being the name of the
district which included parts of the modern comities of
Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Offaly. Mag Tocliair at
the foot of Slieve Snaght in West Inishowen, Co. Donegal :
Mag Seimne is Island Magee or somew^here near it : Mag
Madia appeai-s to survive in the name of Moy, near Armagh :
Mag Miiirthemne is the maritime plain of Co. Louth : Mag
mBernm is doubtful, but is probably on the border betw^een
Carlow and Kildare : Leccmag and Mag Moda are not
identified.
^241. The Fomoire here appear in quite a different character. They have none of the monstrous nature credited to them in the Partholonian section, but (as the glossator
tells us) they have become mere sea-pirates. It may be presumed that this transformation is due to the actual sea
pirates who about the time when the book was taking shape were harrying Ireland. In accordance with this, the leader
is given what appears to be a Teutonic name (Conand or
Conaing ^= Konung, "King") in the appended account of
the battle-struggle. Evidently in its original form the section ended with this paragraph. Badhgna, see above Ij 239. Cnamros is probably, as
Hogan suggests, Camross near Taghmon, Co. Wexford,
and about midway between Wexford Harbour and Bannow Bay. The conditions of the story seem to require some place easily accessible from the sea. Murholg is somewhere in the
north of Co. Antrim. According to a passage quoted by Hogan, Dunseverick is in it ; it must therefore be what is now^ called Wliitepark Bay, not Murloeh as identified by
'Donovan. On Oilean Arda Nemid see ante 11206. The reference to this place here is one more link between that paragraph and the Nemedians.



192 NOTES ON SECTION V.
11242-3. On Conaing's Tower and its topography see
the introduction to this section. The sentence diata ....
moiiongas na Fomore is evidently interpolated, cutting the mention of the oppression off from the description of its nature : the identification with Toirinis Cetne is doubtless
a secondary interpolation. If the origin of the name More, suggested {ante p. 117) be not considered acceptable, it
may possibly be an invention by someone who had picked
up the Old Norse imjrhr, "dark." Morc's father, in spite
of the difference of declension (which is not uniformly maintained) can hardly be dissociated from the "Dela son of Lot" who appears as parent of the Fir Bolg—again linking
these people with the Fomoraig.
Samain = November 1, the beginning of winter. ^ 243
is a semi-cosmogonic story of dispersal, apparently based (in the manipulated form in which we possess it) on the
dispersal of the nations from the Tower of Babel. "The sickness" abruptly introduced in this paragraph is probably
glossarial. "Domon and Herdomon" in the north of
Scotland are diificult to explain. They appear elsewhere, and probably more accurately, as "Debar" and "lar-Dobar"
—Debar and AVest Debar. Skene {Celtic Church,^ i, 166) connects "Dobar" with the river Dour in Aberdeenshire j
but it is not clear what brings this comparatively unimportant river (which is not in Northern Scotland) into the picture; and lardobhar is left unexplained. Moreover districts (or possibly persons) rather than rivers are indicated. The names read like the couplets cf Pictish kings found in the Chronicle of the Picts and Scots,
apparently indicating monarchs who impersonate pairs of
dioseuric divinities—Pant, Urpant; Leo, U(r)leo; Gant, L'^rgant; etc. In Oidheadh Cloinne Tuireann the physician Miach is fitted with a doul^let Oirmiach, whose name is formed in an analogous manner. The story of the assault on the
^ Not Chronicles of the Ficts mid Scots, as stated in tlio index to Dinneen's edition of Keating- s.v. lardobhar. The indexer found the reference "Sk. i. 166" in Hogan's Onomasticon, and did not take
the trouble to ascertain from the table of abbreviations in that work
what " Sk " actually meant : forgetting at the same time that the ''Chronicles of the Picts and Scots" is in one volume onlv.



NOTES ON SECTION V. 193
Tower is told here in the simplest possible way : it grows Avonderfully through the centuries with repetition !
^244. Luid, the first word of this paragraph, is probably inserted : this is suggested by the dative ease of Urib. The original form probably read "S. was in the lands." The agricultural operation described seems to be the manufacture of cultivation-terraces : a succession of walls being built, following the contours of the hills, the spaces between them and the hillside are filled up with clay carried up for the
purpose from the underlying valley. Tarduth . . . scothaih is probably glossarial : it is to be noticed that there is here no
explanation of the "bags" out of which they made their boats. That comes later. Most of this ]\ gives the impression of
being a mass of interpolations. The numerous explanations of the name Fir Bolg show tliat the expression had ceased to have any meaning when our history was compiled. On the names of the Fir Bolg
leaders, see the following section. That the present paragi-aph comes from a source different from that of the preceding matter is shown by the different forms of the name Semul, Semion.
TJ245. The identification of Moin Conain with Anglesey (Mon) seems to be a mere guess of 'Donovan's (Annals Four Masters, Index). There is no record known to me of any eponymous ' ' Oonan ' ' connected with the island : so that in assuming it some caution has to be observed. AUsaxan, which some Mss. combine with the g of the preceding rig to make Gall-Saxan, is the Ald-Seaxum of the Saxon Chronicle.

it (I.T.S. edn., i, 174) ; but neither he nor anyone else, so
far as I am aware, teUs us anything about this personage.
He can hardly be dissociated, however, from Adna son of
Bith, whom Keating mentions as an alternative post-diluvian
invader (I "^-i 1), and to whom we have already referred (vol. ii, p. 174). If so Partholon will be a. doublet of Bith, and it may be that the name of Nemed's father, Agno-main, may
not be altogether irrelevant in this connexion. We have
already seen the importance of this identification, as bringing Partholon into a cosmogonic scheme.
T|248. The first sentence is written in B as though it belonged to the end of the preceding ^\ and referred to Agla,
not to Nemed. The number of ships in W is 44. The story of the golden tower is unknown to, or at least omitted by R^. It is, however, in some fomis as old as Nennius ; see further the introduction to Liher Praecursonim (vol. ii, p. 249). Probably the words in tan ha Idn .... a friar mac maraen
fris, which are an expansion of the story of the disaster, are insertions.
t|249. As in the preceding section, the later redactions
enumerate the women, who are ignored by W. 3Iacha, an important goddess, here makes her first appearance in the narrative : she is met with in different disguises throughout the compilation. The gloss at the end is a reader's attempt to reconcile this enumeration with the ochtar of the preceding
paragraph.

Ard ]Macha = Armagh : the identification is important, as it equates Nemed's wife with the tutelary goddess of that place. The sentence is, however, an insertion not found in W.

^ 252 = ^ 239. Mag Lugad in Ui Tuirtre (the region to the west of Loch Xeagli) corresponds with the unidentified

order of the names, but otherwise the two paragraphs
correspond.
11253 is a combination of 11239 and 11241. Badbgiia and Ros Fraechain are the same place. Artoat is a misreading for larbonel f in Kg it becomes further corrupted to Artur,

linking up, by misapprehension, the Nemed story with the Arthurian legend.

11254. The synchronisms in these two parallel versions
are quite irreconcilable. Poliparis = the Bellepares of Eusebius ; his tenth year would correspond to the 617th year of the Era of Abraham (the fifteenth of the Hebrew judge
Ehud). But the events in the M s}Tichronism are by many J ears anterior to this; and even they are not mutually
consistent. According to the Eusebian canons

11255. The R^ version appears to favour the identification of Toirinis with Tory Island. The puerile etymology of Mag Cetne is unknow^l to R^. The alternative story of the
clearing of the plain by "Ceti mac Alloit," referred to by grM, does not seem to be elsewhere recorded.

''Dardanus condidit Dardaniam." That he was son of
Jove (= Zeus) must have been ascertained by our historians
from some other source (probably Isidore, Etijm. xiv, iii, 41).
The death of Aaron is recorded in the eighth year of
Amintes.
T[262. The notorious freedom of Ireland from venomous
reptiles was explained by several {etiological myths: the
blessing of I\Ioses upon Gaedil Glas, and, as here, the theory
that the soil of Ireland was itself fatal to such creatures: to say nothing of the tourist guide-book nonsense about St. Patrick. Till well into the IMiddle Ages it apparently
was believed that no spider would spin its web in a roof composed of Irish timber. Ireland's immunity is, however,
presupposed in the Cessair story, which by hypothesis ante
dates all the other benefactors !
1j264. Britus mac Issicoin is Brutus son of Ascanius (son
of Aeneas), the ancestor of the British people as set forth
by Geoffrey of Monmouth. This Isieon is a different person
from the Isieon of 1j 9. At note {^~) it will be observed that
R^ inserts the words ut poeta dixit, without any following
poem. This suggests that som.e now lost poem or quatrain
may underlie the following words : and it may be that they
originally ran somewhat in this style

the same poem.

Starnaines, lardanaines. A reference to the quest for ''the

1(270-1. This fragment, on an isolated leaf of the ms. here called H, presents a different version of the Nemed saga. It has been edited already by Dr. Vernam Hull.^ The style approaches to the bombastic inflated manner of mediaeval and early modern story tellers : there is no parallel elsewhere
in the LG canon to the "taunt-speech," inciting a warriot tc battle-fury, such as is not infrequent in the later romances.
The text of LG- in H finished with this fragment, for it is followed immediately on the same leaf by a version of the story of the Expulsion of the Dessi, after which comes the following colophon : In geimread do gab Donnchad o Ceindead i{n)d airdeaspog Caisil a tige, do sgrihad so a tig Msic an Gahann an uramaig : Ben{n)aclit do. This dales the MS. to some time before 1252, the date of the death of the
Archbishop referred to.
Loch Sentninnc ~ Loch Febail = Loch Foyle. Mag
Glas = ]\Iag Tibra = estuary of the River Moy. The poem quoted at the end of the fragment is not set forth in full :
only the first line is given.
11272-3. The dates are wrong in their relation to the Eusebian reckoning. The 640th year of the era of Abraham corresponds with the third year of Lamprides : the ninth year of his predecessor Bellepares is a.a. 616. As usual, the names and dates of the alleged Assyrian kings are badly mauled. The Hieronyman forms of the names are given in the translation : the following corrections must be made in
the regnal years—Panyas 45 years,® Sosarmus 19 years,'' Thineus 30 years, Dercilus (-cylus, Migne), omitted in the Irish text after Thineus, 40 years, Eupales 38 years,^ Laosthenes 45 years. The tale of the effeminacy of Sardanapalus (Assur-bani-pal) is familiar from Greek sources,
^Modern Philology/, xxxiii (1935), p. 120. * The 38 years assigned to the preceding Lampares in Migne 's edition is a misprint : 30 is correct. ' In Syncellus 22, according to a note in Migne. * ' ' Clafares ' ' in the Irish text must represent some sort of conflation between Der-cil-us and Eu-paZ-es.

though it is needless to say that there is no authority for the alleged transformation of the king into a hag : this has probably arisen from a careless reading of Orosiiis I xix 1, 2.
It hardly requires the testimony of Ass:sTian documents to show that the whole story is absurdly fictitious from beginning to end.
^274. The names of these alleged Amazonian queens are borrowed, from Orosius, I xv 4ff. Eusebius recognises no Amazonian hegemony, and his chronological scheme leaves no room for it. The opening words of ^ 275 show that it is a lat'er interpolation, in the Irish text itself.
^275. The reign of Medidus is given by Eusebius at 40,
not 20 years ; the captivity is assigned to the 15th year of his reign. Cardiceas is credited by Eusebius with 13, not 14
years. The synchronism suggested with the last King of Assyria" {recte Babylonia) is quite indefensible.
iI
^276. The reign of Cyaxares was 32 years according to Eusebius, not 28. Astyages reigned 38, not 8 years.
II 277. These particulars about Babylonian kings come fi'om a fragment of Alexander Polyhistor, derived from the Babylonian historian Berossus. The figures are quite wrong. Nabuchodonosor should have been credited with 43 years on the data supplied. Evil Merodach with 12, Neglisarus with 4.

This (or some other) versified list must be the original form, for the prose text would not have so completely accommodated itself
to metrical limitations. As in the R^ version, Beoan appears only as the father of Ergian and his iw^o brethren, not (as
in R2) as a separate chieftain. Caman and Taman appear to be doublets ; a new name, Gothiam, is added, which does not appear in any of the prose texts ; and Bethach is duplicated.

marks of interrogation apiece : Posro = Port : Pella -
Maegla : Enda = Ida : 011a = Ceawlin : Ella = ^lla. It is not even certain whether Pinguis is supposed to be a name,

SECTION VI: FIR BOLG.
Introduction ....






SECTION VI.
Fir Bolg.
Introduction.
The short episode of the Fir Bolg is the most jejune of all the sections of Liber Praecursorum; yet it is not devoid
of suggestiveness.
In R 1 the five lords and their five wives arrive (ft 278). Their division into three groups, various landing places, and division of the country, are unknown to L, being reported
only by F (fl 279). The five brethren reign hi turn; the first four of these apparently die natural deaths, but the fifth is slain by his successor, in the normal ''Golden Bough" manner, and this is continued to the end of the occupation. There are nine kings in all ; but one, Eochu mac Eire, seems to stand outside the family succession, so that we have here as elsewhere the damh ochtair, though it is not so expressed in this case (jj 280). This last king has to meet the invading Tuatha De Danann, and falls before them. The details of
the battle are given in an obvious interpolation (ff 281), which also describes the subsequent fate of the Fir Bolg; this is continued in fl 282, which practically says that they left no tangible traces behind them. The three remaining paragraphs are further snippets, which add nothing to our
knowledge.
R
2 describes the coming of the Fir Bolg in coracles made of the bags with which they had carried out their servile
duties; and narrates their landing and partition of the country, to the same effect as in ff 279, but in different
words (U 286). In fl 287 this is expanded, genealogically and etymologically, with interpolations here indicated by means of smaller type.
The succession of the kings is given in ff 288. In U 289 we read of their defeat at Mag Tuired, and in fl 290 of the
mutilation of Nuadu, the Tuatha De Danann leader, in the
battle. U 291 repeats with much expansion the particulars
in U 281 as to the dispersal of the Fir Bolg, and their
L.G.—VOL. IV. B



2 SECTION VI.
alleged descendants in Ireland are enumerated in fl 292.
The additional fl 293 is a mere recapitulatory interpolation.
The composition of R3 can, as before, be set forth in tabular form.
*1294 = R1 1278
*1 295 = R1 1 279 with a few slight deviations
and insertions.
*1296 = R1
IT 280 with some interpolations.
*1297, 298 = R1 1281
*1299 = R1 1282; but the latter portion, introducing poem no.
XLIX, is new, taking
the place of Rx 1283.
1 300 = R1 1 284
after which come the Synchronisms. R3 therefore gives us here practically the complete text of *Q, with a few interpolations which can be detected by comparison with the extant text of P; and until he comes to the Synchronisms
he ignores R2 altogether, except that he borrows from the VA
group of R2 (to which his copy, *W, seems to have belonged) the etymological fatuities that "points" (rindi) were first put upon javelins in the days of Rinnail, and that "knots" (fuidb) first appeared in timber in the reign of Foidbgenid. In considering this episode, naturally the first question
which arises is the meaning of the name Fir Bolg. We may discard all "Belgic" and similar theories without discussion.
We need not waste time over the "bags of earth" about which our historians tell us. Kuno Meyer's explanation (first given, so far as I know, in his Contributions to Irish Lexicography s.v. "bolg") is by far the most reasonable:
that Fir Bolg == Fir i mBolgaib (an expression used in poem
no. XLIX, quatrain 5) = bracati or breeches-wearers. Thus interpreted, it becomes a term of contempt for the "lower
orders"; applied, by those who wore the dignified flowing costumes which the sculptures of the "High Crosses" depict for us, to those who found it convenient, in the life of activity in which their lot was cast, to have each leg separately clothed. Of such persons there are occasional representations, e.g., in the initial letters of illuminated manuscripts. This section then, in its present form, is intended to be an
i
I Sanation of how the "plebeians," if so we may call them, came to Ireland ; prepared for the benefit of the ' ' patricians
''
for whose information the history, as a whole, was compiled.



INTRODUCTION. 3
This, however, is only a secondary adaptation of the story. It is really no history, but a member of the same mythological complex as the rest. The parentage of the
people with whom it is concerned, Dela son of Lot, links
them immediately with the Fomorians; and this is corroborated when we find that the Fomorian leaders, who
challenged "the holy man" Nemed, are named Gann and
Sengann, "Gann and Old Gann"—names conspicuous in the Fir Bolg quintet. Gann and Genann are almost certainly a Dioscuric pair; and there can be little doubt that Sengann was originally the father of the twins, though the fact has become obscured by later speculations in artificial genealogy. The other two "Fir Bolg" leaders, Slanga and Rudraige, are borrowed straight out of the
Partholonian cycle. And though these persons afflict the children of Nemed, they are conquered in the end : it is certainly no coincidence that persons described as "three sons of Nemed" appear in ff 289 to slay the last of the Fir Bolg kings. That the names of the father, and of the sons, of this Nemed are different from the correspondingnames associated with wThat we may call the ' ' official ' ' Nemed,
is a matter of comparatively small importance in criticizing
the identification. And we further note that the names of the sons of the Nemed before us, Cessarb, Luam, Luachra, are suggestively reminiscent of the antediluvian triad Capa, Luigne, and Luasad. In a word, the perennial contention
of good and evil, light and darkness, plenty and famine, follows its normal course, all through the Fir Bolg episode. The agricultural ritual of king-killing is prominently stressed : the golden age of calm weather and blissful fertility presided over by the good king Eochu mac Eire is intensely primitive.
In his present setting Eochu mac Eire is altogether out of 1he picture : he has probably intruded on the uncongenial company in which we find him by a confusion of name. In
R
1 Eochu son of Rinnail, who slew his predecessor Foidbgenid,
is a different person from Eochu son of Ere : it was the R2
school of historians who discovered (or dreamt) that Ere was son of Rinnail, and who thus equated the two persons. The most complete link with the Fomorians is provided by the subsequent adventures, where, under various leaders,
the Fir Bolg disperse to certain outlying islands and other



4 SECTION VI.
remote places. Each leader of these fugitives is called a "son of Umor"1
: and this vague personage is connected with the "Sliab Emoir," from which the Fomorians had set forth on their two-hundred years' voyage to Ireland. That the Fomorians did not disturb the Fir Bolg during their
occupation Is most easily explained on the hypothesis that these were essentially Fomorians themselves, at least from
the standpoint of Mythology. The conclusions thus indicated can be expressed in tabular
form thus :



INTRODUCTION. 5
Two things come out clearly from a comparison of the
three Redactions of this section of LG. First, that they are
ultimately founded upon an independent saga, external to
the LG tradition. There is a closer correspondence between the texts here than in the rest of Liber Praecursorum :
even R 2
, though it still stands apart from the other redactions, has here a closer affinity with them than elsewhere. Secondly,
that this basal saga became what we may term historicopolitical rather than mythological. It was designed to explain the origin not only of the "Plebeians," as we have seen, but
also of the "Five Fifths," the Pentarchy of independent
kingdoms, into which we find Ireland to be divided when the uncertain rays of dawning history first shine upon her. The five leaders divide the country between them; their divisions correspond more or less with the Pent archie division which we find in being, at the time of the Medb-Conchobor cycle of romance. This, however, is again a secondary adaptation, for the story does not hang together consistently in its present
form. We begin with a five-fold monarchy, each king in his
own province : but we end with a succession of the same monarchs, apparently ruling over the whole country each in
his turn—with the exception of the twins, Gann and Genann,
who go together. 2 It is the old trouble over again : each historian sought to improve on the work of his predecessor, never realizing that every change would require a number of consequential changes throughout the whole compilation. Hence arises the mass of inconsistencies and contradictions
with which the book is filled. Thus, in ff 279, a glossator
informs us that the Fir Domnann were so called because they landed in Iriber Domnann. Some lines lower down, an
earlier glossator had stated the exact contrary—that the creek received its name from the men : and he, or another, had explained the name of the Fir Domnann in a totally different way. To attempt to make any reconciliation between
these discrepancies would be merely futile. They exist, and their existence must be accepted as evidence of the complex
artificiality of our texts, and of nothing more.
2 By muddled manipulation Genann and Sengann are sometimes paired off together, and in the list of kings Sengann, "old Gann," succeeds his presumably younger namesakes.

278. Now as for the Fir Bolg, they brought five
chieftains with them, ut dixi supra, to wit, Gann, Genann,
Rudraige, Sengann, Slanga : those were the five sons of
Dela. Their five wives next, Anust, Liber, Cnucha,

279. The Fir Bolg separated into three. With Slanga s.
Dela s. Loth his third [landed] in Inber Slaine : his Fifth is from Inber Colptha to Comar Tri nUisce; a thousand men his
tally. The second third landed in Inber Dubglaisi with Gann
and Sengann : two thousand were their tally, Gann from
Comar Tri nUisce to Belach Conglais, Sengann from Belach
I longlais to Luimneach—that is, over the two Fifths of Miunu. Genann and Rudraige with a third of the host, they landed
in Inber Domnann : [whence they are called Fir Domnann] .
Genann it is who was king over the Fifth of Medb and Ailell;
Rudraige over the Fifth of Conchobor—other two thousand were his tally. Those are the Fir Bolg, the Fir Domnann, and the Gailioin.
As to the Fir Domnann, the creek takes its name from them. The
Fir Bolg—they were named from their bags. The Gailioin, from the multitude of their javelins were they named.
They made one Taking and one princedom, for they were

they took Ireland, [though the days were different]. On Saturday, the kalends of August, Slanga landed in Inber
Slaine. On Tuesday Gann and Sengann landed. On Friday
Genann and Rudraige landed : and thus is it one Taking,
though they were differently styled. The Gaileoin, from Slanga
were they named. From Gann and Sengann were the Fir Bolg
named. The Fir Domnann were named from deepening the earth : they were Genann and Rudraige with their followers. For they are all called Fir Bolg, and thirty-seven years was the length of their lordship over Ireland. The five sons of Dela were the five kings of the Fir Bolg, i.e., Gann, Genann, Rudraige, Sengann, Slaine.
280. [Now these men, the FirBolg, were the progeny of
Dela.] Slanga was the eldest, s. Dela s. Loth s. Oirthet s. Tribuat s. Gothorb s. Gosten s. Fortech s. Semeon s. Erglan s. Beoan s. Starn s. Nemed s. Agnomain. No king took, who was called "of Ireland," till the FirBolg came.
Nine kings of them took Ireland. SLANGA, one
year—it is he who died of the Fir Bolg in Ireland at the first. RUDRAIGE, two years, till he died in Brug
Bratruad. GANN and GENANN, four years, till they
died of plague in Fremaind. SENGANN, five years, till he fell at the hands of Fiacha Cendfindan s. Starn
[s. Rudraige s. Dela]. FIACHA, five years— [all the
cows of Ireland had white heads in his presence] —till he fell at the hands of Rindail s. Genann s. Dela. RINDAIL, six years, till he fell at the hands of
Fodbgenid s. Sengann s. Dela in Eba Coirpre.

EOCHU son of Ere, ten years. There was no wetting
in his time, save only dew : there was no year without harvest. Falsehoods were expelled from Ireland in his
time. By him was executed the law of justice in Ireland for the first time. Eochu son of Ere fell at the hands of the three sons of Xemed s. Badra : he is the first king
of Ireland who received his death-wound in Ireland. [Unde Colum Cille cecinit "Dena moresnis a mic," etc.]
281. The Fir Bolg gave them [the Tuatha De Danann] battle upon Mag Tuired ; they were a long time fighting that battle. At last it broke against the Fir Bolg, and the slaughter pressed northward, and a hundred thousand of them were slain westward to the strand of Eochaill. There was the king Eochu overtaken, and he fell at the hands of the three sons of Nemed. Yet the Tuatha De Danann suffered great loss in the battle, and they left the king on the field, with his arm cut from him; the leeches were seven years healing him. The Fir Bolg fell in that battle all but a few, and they went out of Ireland in flight from the Tuatha. De Danann, into Ara, and He, and Rachra and other islands besides. [It was they who led the
Fomoraig to the second battle of Mag Tuired.] And they were in [those islands] till the time of the Provincials over Ireland, till the Cruithne drove them out. They came to Cairbre Nia Fer, and he gave them lands; but they were unable to remain with him for the heaviness of the impost which he put upon them. Thereafter they came in flight before Cairbre under the protection of Medb and of Ailill, and these gave them lands. This is the wandering of the sons of Umor. [Oengus son of
Umor was king over them in the east], and from them are named those territories, Loch Cime from Cime Four-heads son of Umor, the Point of Taman in Medraige from Taman son of Umor, the Fort of Oengus in Ara from Oengus, the Stone-heap

286. Next comes the Taking of the Fir Bolg here
below. Ireland was waste for a space of two hundred
years after the capture of Conaing's Tower, till the
Fir Bolg came, [as we have said in the poem]. From the lands of the Greeks they came, fleeing from the
impost which the Greeks had laid upon them—carrying
clay on to bare rock-flags and making them flowery
plains. Those men made them long canoes of the bags in which they were wont to carry the clay, and they came
lo Ireland, in quest of their patrimony. As everyone does, they partitioned Ireland.
With Slanga s. Dela s. Lot his third landed in Inber Slaine : his Fifth is from Inber Colptha to Comar Tri nUisce : a thousand men his tally. The second third landed in Inber Dubglaisi with Gann and Sengann : two thousand were their
tally—Gann from the Comar to Belach Conglais, Sengann from
Belach Conglais to Luimnech, that is, over the Two Fifths of
Mumu. Genann and Rudraige with a third of the host, they
landed in Inber Domnann [which is why they are called Fir
Bomnann] —Genann over the Fifth of Medb and Ailill, Rudraige over the Fifth of Conchobor : two thousand were their tally.

287. Those are the Fir Bolg, the Fir Domnann, and the Gaileoin.
Fir Domnann, from Inber Domnann, the name of the creek where they landed, are they called; or Fir Domnann, that is fir domain- fonn (Men of
territory-deepening), that is, men who used to deepen the mundus, or the
world. Fir Bolg then, from the bags in which they used to carry the
earth are they named. The Gaileoin, that is gaei-lm [javelins-reckoning]
from the javelins are they named : for it was in their javelins that they
were renowned. Or Gaileoin, that is gaileoin or gail'fian [valour-warriors] ;
the third who used to exercise authority over the other two thirds [fo ghael
"under the viceroy"]. The Fir Bolg are the people of the carrying, the
Fir Domnann the people of the digging, the Gaileoin the people who used to exercise authority over them.
They are one Taking and one princedom, for they
were five brethren, the five sons of Dela son of Loth [son of Artuat]. In one week they landed : On Saturday, the kalends of August, Slanga landed in Inber Slaine :
On Tuesday, the second pair, Gann and Sengand : on
Friday the other pair, Genand and Rudraige. Thus they are one Taking, though they were differently styled.
The Gaileoin is what Slanga and his people are called :
The Fir Bolg is what Gann and Sengann are called,
[though it is not the most special name for them] ; the Fir Domnann, named from the creek, they are Genann and Rudraige with their people. Howbeit, they are all called Fir Bolg, and thirty-seven years was the length of their reign over Ireland.

293. The Fir Bolg divided Ireland into five portions, as we have said above. The Fifth of Gann it is, over which
Cairpre Nia Fer was, that is from the Boyne to Comar Tri nUisce. The Fifth of Sengann it is, over which Eochaid son of Lncht was. The Fifth of Slaine it is, over which Dega son of Sin was. The Fifth of Genann it is, over which Ailill son of Mata was. The
Fifth of Rudraige it is, over which Conchobar son of Ness was. That then is the division which shall be upon Ireland for ever, so that of it was

That is the wandering of the Fir Bolg men, and thereof the learned historian sang : Tanaide cecinit

Now as for the Fir Bolg, they brought five chieftains with them ut dixi supra, to wit, Gann, Genann, Rudraige, Sengann, Slanga : those were the five sons of Dela. Their

Slanga landed in Inber Slaine. On Tuesday Gann and
Sengann landed. On Friday, moreover, Genann and Eudraige landed; and thus it is one Taking, though they
were differently styled. The Gaileoin, from Slanga
were they named. From Gann and from Sengann were
the Fir Bolg named. The Fir Domnann were named from deepening the earth : they were Genann and
Eudraige with their followers. Notwithstanding, they are all called "Fir Bolg" : and thirty-seven years was the length of their lordship over Ireland. Those are the five sons of Dela, namely the five kings of the

297. And the Fir Bolg gave them battle upon Mag
Tuired, and were a long time fighting that battle : and
it broke against the Fir Bolg, and the .slaughter pressed
northward, and a hundred thousand of them were slain,
from there to Traig Eothaili. There was the king Eochu
overtaken, and he fell at the hands of the three sons of
Nemed [son of Badra—Cesarb, Luam and Luachra
were their names. He is the last prince of the Fir Bolg.]
Belochus of the Assyrians
was in the high kingship at that time of the fighting the battle of Mag Tuired of Cong
and of the coming of the Tuatha De Danann into Ireland.
Yet the Tuatha De Danann .suffered great loss in the battle, and they left the king on the field, with his arm cut from him. The leeches were healing him, [as the
poet says (in) the quatrain
Poem no. L].
298. So the Fir Bolg fell in that battle all but a few,
and they went out of Ireland in flight from the Tuatha
De Danann : and landed in Ara, and He, and Rachra, [and Britain], and other islands besides; [and it was they who led the Fomoraig thereafter to the second battle of
Magh Tuired.] And they were in those islands till the time of the Provincials over Ireland, till the Cruithne drove them out. Then they came to Cairpre Nia Fer,

and he gave them lands : but they were unable to remain
with him for the heaviness of the tribute which he imposed upon them. They came in flight before Cairbre
under the protection of Ailill and Medb, and these gave
them lands : that is the wandering of the sons of Umor.
Oengus son of Umor was king over them in the east;
and from them are named those lands—Loch Cime from Cime Four-heads son of Umor, the Point of Taman in
Medraige from Tainan son of Umor, Dun Oengusa in
Ara from Oengus, the Stone-heap of Conall in Aidne
from Conall, the plain of Adar from Adar, the plain of
Asal in Minna from Asal son of Umor also. Mend son
of Umor was the poet. They were in fortresses and in islands of the sea round about Ireland in this manner,
till Cu Chulaind quenched them. Of that journeying of
the sons of Umor and of the names of their men and of
their lands, the historian said the following song
Poem no. LI.
299. And no forts or entrenchments are reckoned as having been dug, nor lakes to have burst forth, nor plains to have been cleared, in the time of the Fir Bolg.
And of their seed are the three communities who are in Ireland not of Goidelic stock; to wit, the Gabraide of the Sue in Connachta, the Ui Tairsig, and the Gaileoin in Laigen. Those are the adventures of the Fir Bolg,
and thereof the historian sang the following song

And it is of that Taking, and And it is of that same Taking
of the actions of Eochu son of of the Fir Bolg, and of their
Ere, and to praise him, and to history from first to last, and of set forth diligently every their adventures in every land,
knowledge, that Colum Cille and of the actions of Eochu son sang this poem eloquently— of Ere, and to praise his lordship and his truth, and to
praise diligently everything
known [of him], that Colum Cille, the chief poet of the
Gaedil, sang this song, verify
ing his excellence
Poem no. XLVIII.
300. The Fir Bolg divided Ireland into five parts, as
we have said above. The Fifth of Genann (read Gann)
it is, over which was Cairbre s. Eoss. The Fifth of Sengann it is, over -which Avas Eochaid s. Lucht. The Fifth of Slainge it is, over which was Dedad s. Sin. The Fifth of Genann it is, over which was Ailell s. Mata. The Fifth of Eudraige it is, over which was Conchobor s. Xess. There then is the division under which the provinces of Ireland shall ever be, as the Fir Bolg divided them.
To commemorate that the historian sang this song
Poem no. LIT.
As for the progeny of Semeon, they are all the Galeoin and Fir Bolg and Fir Domnann, and thirty years after Genann and
Rudraige the Tuatha De Danann came into Ireland. That then is the Taking of the Fir Bolg down to this : and Ireland was

waste for two hundred years from the capture of Conainn's tower till the Fir Bolg came.
This is the tale of the years which it contained. The Lordship of the Assyrians was then over the world, and even afterwards.
Synchronism of the Taking of the Fir Bolg.
(In R2 and B.)
301. The Synchronism of the kings of the world here with the kings of the Fir Bolg. It was in the end of the lordship of the Chaldeans that the Fir Bolg came into Ireland.
BALLAST AR was their last prince; it is to him that there
appeared the fist without a wrist, a-writing : and what it wrote
was MANE, THECEL, and PHABES, "number" and "weight"
and "division." Against him did Cyrus son of Darius capture Babylon, and he slew Ballastar. This is that Cyrus who released
the captivity to Jerusalem, after they had been seventy years in captivity.
302. The lordship of the Persians then, after the Medes:
twelve kings had they in the lordship. They spent 230 years. They were of the seed of Elam son of Sem son of Noe, and were called Elamites till the time of Perseus son of Jove : but Persians from that onward. He who was their first king was

CYRUS son of Darius. Thirty years had he till he fell at the hands of the Scythians, surrounded by three hundred thousand
men. It is he who brought the fifty thousand of the captivity of Jerusalem from Babylon, and five thousand golden vessels and many thousand silver vessels.
CAMBYSES son of Cyrus thereafter. Eight years, till his own magicians slew him : Eochaid son of Ere was in the kingship of Ireland at that time. Those are the thirty-seven years
that the Fir Bolg were in Ireland—from the first year of the reign of Cyrus son of Darius to the seventh year of Cambyses son of Cyrus. In his eighth year the Tuatha De Danann came into Ireland, and they fought the battle of Mag Tuired with the Fir Bolg, and slew Eochaid son of Ere. Finit.

the five kings, G-ann, Genann, Rudraige, Sengann, Slanga : Slanga was the eldest of them. Nine of their kings took Ireland. Slanga had a year, till he died in
Duma Slaine, and there was he buried; and he is the first of the Fir Bolg who died in Ireland. Rudraige post, two years, till he died in the Brug. Genann and
Gann in joint rule, four years, till they died of plague in Fremand. Sengann, five years, till he fell at the hands of Fiacha Cendfindan s. Starn s. Rudraige s. Dela. Fiacha Cendfindan, five years, till he fell at the hands of Rindail. Rindail three years, till he fell at the hands of
Foidbgen s. Sengann in Eba. Foidbgen, four years till
he fell in Mag Muirtheimne at the hands of Eochu s. Ere.
Eochu s. Ere, ten years. There was no wetting in that time [but only dew]. There was not a year without harvest.
By him was falsehood expelled from Ireland. By him was the law of justice established first in Ireland.
Eochu s. Ere fell at the hands of the three sons of Nemed
s. Badra, so that he is the first king who was mortally wounded with javelins in Ireland. Those are the kings of the Fir Bolg in Ireland, and their deaths, and the length of their reign, ut supra diximus in the Taking, .i.e. in capturis Hiberniae, id est

R

(]\ 286), which reads like the introduction of just such an independent saga as we have seen reason to postulate in the introduction to this section.

from L, and although in F # Q perhaps not originally in R1
.
F and *Q (== R 3
) are essentially identical, though comparison reveals glossarial matter (chiefly etymological) in both texts, indicated in the way usually followed in this edition; these glosses are contradictory, and have no doubt accumulated
in several strata. We mark the words cia ba same laithi as
glossarial, though they appear in both R1 and R3
, because the two mss. of R3 have both muddled the sentence, and in different ways. This suggests to me that it was inter
lined, not very legibly, in oo R3
, the exemplar from which both texts are ultimately derived : from which it follows that il was interlined in *Q. Even excising the glosses, the paragraph is evidently composite, as the second half is to a large extent an unnecessary repetition of matter in the first
half. Here Gann and Genann are separated, Gann being paired off with Sengann, and Genann with Rudraige. Once
again we find a vague date—Saturday the kalends of Augustbut no year-number. But the date is not arbitrary : it has been calculated, apparently on the basis of the Julian
calendar. For R2
, in ]\ 322, informs us that the Tuatha De Danann landed on Monday, the kalends of May. This was 37 years after the Fir Bolg invasion: and if the first year of a stretch of 37 years, reckoned by the Julian calendar, has its first of August on Saturday, there are three chances to one that the last year will have its first of May on Monday : (if the last year be leap-year, the day will be



NOTES ON SECTION VI. 77
Tuesday). Once more we see evidence that these dates were computed, and we infer that the year-numbers were entered in the margins of the earlier mss. The sentence in ff 286, amail atrubrumar issin duain, has been marked as an inter
polation : it does not ring true, and it evidently refers to
Poem XLI, quatrain 34, which is also interpolated—quite likely by the same man.
Inber Slaine = the Slaney Estuary; Inber ColptJw = the
Boyne Estuary; Comar ha dtri nuisce = the confluence of the Suir, Xore, and Barrow (thus Slanga's "Fifth" is Laigen).
Inber Dubglaisi perhaps = mouth of the Douglas river between Blackrock and Passage, Co. Cork : Belach Conglais is £ pass running through the neighbourhood of Cork : Luimnech is the region where now stands the city of Limerick (so that the "Fifth" of Gann was East Muma, and that of Sengann
West Muma). Inber Domnann = Malahide Bay: Genann's
"Fifth" was Connacha, Rudraige's was Ulaid.
R

ff 280 = R2 U 288 = R3
fl 296. The opening sentence
in R 1 is L's substitute for the preceding paragraph. Though
here marked as giossarial it is quite likely germinal, being the original sentence out of which the details set forth in
ft 279 have been developed. R 1 and R3 agree except for a few interpolations, easily detected by comparison, and here indicated typographically. (The paragraph almost certainly began with the words Noi rig dib, the preceding sentence being a giossarial comment interlined above, and the now pre
fixed genealogy having been originally a marginal intrusion.)
R
2 gives the same material though with a different verbal
order. R 3 is of course from *Q, but it cannot be said that
R
2 has either borrowed from or lent to R1 directly. Both come from a common source, which most likely was a heavily glossed copy of Min, TJ 303. As has been noted in the introduction to this section, this paragraph is quite
incompatible, in its conception of the political organization of Ireland, with what has just gone before : it must necessarily come from a different source. Bind Big or Duma Slainge is usually identified with an imposing earthwork overlooking the Barrow a short distance south of Leighlin Bridge. It is now commonly called Burgage Motte, and although in size and in other respects it differs



78 NOTES ON SECTION VI.
from an ordinary Norman earthwork, it bears a sufficient resemblance to that class of monuments to make necessary a test by excavation before the identification can be fully
accepted. Brug Bratruad is identified with Brug na BoinneKeating tells us that it was at the latter place that Rudraige was slain : but I have found no story to account for the name of the "Palace of the Red Cloaks." Fremaind is Frewin Hill, Co. Westmeath, and Mag Muirthemne is the
plain of Co. Louth. Eba Choirpri, the plain N. of Ben Bulbin, has undergone a curious metamorphosis in passing from text to text. The influence of inflexional de-nasalization has provided it with an illegitimate initial D, and the
resulting "Deba" has become confused with debaid or debed, "strife." Meanwhile GJioirpri, written ^p 1
, has been wrongly expanded into Craibi. As there were several places called Craeb, a "battle" in one of them would not have appeared impossible. The violent contradiction of these king-killings by the statement that Eochu mac Eire was "the first monarch to receive a mortal wound in Ireland" is enough to show that what we are told about him came from a quite different document, which knew nothing of the Fir Bolg kings and their fates, and which in all probability had originally nothing whatever to do with the Fir Bolg. The interpolation after the name of Fiacha, that "Cows were white-headed in his time" is repeated on almost every occasion when we encounter one of the fairly numerous kings of that name. "What its ultimate meaning may be, or if it has any ultimate meaning at all, are questions for which it
is possible to give conjectural answers, without, however,
any expectation of being able to verify them.

added to the preceding U 296 to some extent, but imperfectly,
fills the lacuna : R 2 has long explanatory passages in its two
versions (V as against DER), emphasizing the virtues of Eochaid mac Eire, and describing briefly the coming of the Tuatha De Danann (reserving a fuller account for the
following section). R2 has undoubtedly the best text : it has the most complete list of the places in which the Fir Bolg found refuge, and has a number of unusual words for which easier synonyms are substituted in P*Q : these are almost
certainly glosses in the source-text, which the scribes of those mss. have adopted in preference to their respective lemmata.
The sentence conad iad tuc Fomorcha .... Muigi Tuirid which suggestively brings the Fir Bolg and the Fomorians into association with one another, was an interlined gloss in
the source-text : it has been adopted by R1 and R2 in different places, and in both makes an awkward interruption of the sense. The same may be said of Oengus mac Umoir ba rig tair orro, which, though appearing in all three redactions, interrupts the sense no less awkwardly. Incidentally it hints at an eastern origin for the Fir Bolg, incompatible with
the matter immediately preceding, but quite appropriate to the identification of those people with the Fomorians. This sentence must have been a mere gloss in the source-text.
Glosses and other modifications within the LG tradition itself are not marked in this paragraph, in order to make a distinction between the two groups of accretions. Instead, they are catalogued below. The reference letters are inserted in the text.

In the list of refuge-sites, WW are similar. R2 inserts
Loch Cutra, Rind mBera, Modlinn, Mag Main, and Loch
TJair. On the other hand R 2 omits some of the names of persons eponymous of these sites, which we may therefore suppose to have been glossarial in the original text. The
eponym of Mag M<xm is preserved by RX R3 hanging in the air, so to speak, as the place to which his name is attached has dropped out from those texts. Druim nAsail has become
Mag nAsail in WW, presumably by the influence of the two
plains by which it is flanked. The words a Mumain are betrayed as glossarial by the various positions in which they are found. Whether the contrast between the longer list of
the enemies of the refugees in R2 (end of fl 291) and the
single name of Cu Chulaind in the other texts is due to editorial expansion or contraction it is impossible to determine. The usual identification of the site of the first battle of
Mag Tuired is in the neighbourhood of Cong, and it is
asserted in an interpolation in the M text of fl 297 : the second battle, between the Tuatha De Danann and the in
vading Fomorians, is alleged to have taken place at Moytirra, near Sligo. But Traig Eothaile is the strand of Ballysadaie Bay, a couple of miles or so from the Sligo site : which seems



NOTES ON SECTION VI. 81
to .suggest at least an uncertainty as to the respective sites of the battles. The original form of the present story may have localized the battle at the SligQ site : in which case the
statement that the slaughter pressed north/ward, which is notappropriate to the Sligo site, may be a harmonistic interpolation, intruded after scholars had agreed to adopt the Cong site as the scene of the first battle. Thus interpreted,
the passage gives us an illuminating ''peep behind the scenes" at our history-mongers' legend-factory.
As lie and Rachra are, no doubt, Islay and Rathlin—the
text suggests that they are away from Eriu—it is likely that Ara is the Scottish Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, in spite
of the mention of Dun Aengusa in the second list of Fir Bolg settlements. Loch Cimme is Loch Hacket, Co. Galway; but though the eponymous "Four-headed Cimme" is mentioned in the Dindsenchus texts referred to below, neither there nor
in Coir Anmann are we told the reason for his peculiar epiklesis. Rind Tamain in Medraige is identified with Towan Point in the Maree peninsula, S. of Oranmore Bay,
Co. Galway. Dim Aengusa is of course the famous fortress
of that name on the summit of Aran Mor, Galway Bay. Cam Conaill in Aidne : Aidne is the district surrounding Kilmacduagh, in the S.W. of Co. Galway, and the name of Ballyconnell near Gort has been supposed by 'Donovan to contain a reference to the name of the earn. Mag n Adair
is presumably the Dalcassian inauguration-site near Quin, 1 !o. Clare. Druim nAsail is identified by Hogan with Tory
Hill near Croom (s.v. Cnoe Droma Asail), and Mag nAsail with Rathconrath barony in Co. "Westmeath: these identi
fications are incompatible, though the two geographical terms are used interchangeably. The majority of these Fir Bolg sites being in and about Co. Galway, Rathconrath seems too tar to the east to be grouped with them : a site in that neighbourhood would hardly be within the gift of Ailill and Medb. Loch Cuthra is doubtless the lake in Galway which still retains a recognizable form of the ancient name, and Rind na inBcra (Kinvarra) is in the same locality. Mod-linn is presumably Clewr Bay ; at least in the Metrical Dindsenchus
(ed. Gwynn, iii, p. 442) this name is used in correspondence
to Insi Mod (=the ClewT Bay Islands) in the prose text.

Mag Main, alitor Moen-mag, is the plain surrounding
Lougiirea in Galway. Loch nilair is the name of Loch
Owel in Westmeath, but the same objection applies to this identification as to Mag nAsail above. It may be the lost
name of some small lake, turloch, or inlet in S.W. Galway.
The Dindsenchus of Cam Conaill (R.C., xv, p. 478) and its appended poem (reference above, and see also below, poem no. LII) narrate the same story, in some respects more fully. It gives details of the lands which the Fir Bolg obtained
from Coirpre Nia Fer, and something of the imposts wThich led to their revolt : it also gives a rather fuller list of the lands granted by Ailill and Medb, and some details of the
destruction of the settlers by the Pentarchs. Note that Medb
and Ailill exchange places in R3 as against RX R2
: masculine superiority has at last asserted itself ! At coicedach (fl 291 note. (

Massagetae in 529. His son Cambyses reigned 529-522 : that he was killed by his wizards is a blundered version of the episode of the Magian who masqueraded as the murdered Smerdis.

is very elusive : I am not at all sure that the figurative
rendering to which I find myself reduced is legitimate. (18). I cannot venture a guess as to the circumstances alluded to in this quatrain, nor yet the meaning of derither. (19). Another very obscure quatrain; once more the numerous variants betray the vain efforts of the copyists to make sense of it. (20) 1621. The identification of "Druim Dean" seems uncertain, nor does there appear to be any record of a connexion between Colum Cille and any place so named. This suggests a doubt as to whether the alleged author of the poem is not some other Colum.

Metre: Cro cummaisc etir rindaird ocus lethrannaigecht. Alleged author Fintan.
This poem appears in L only : in the other mss. poem no. LII, which covers the same ground, takes its place.
(1) 1627 : Cainle, here used in the sense of saints.
(3) 1635. This couplet is not easy to construe neatly.
Buthach seems to mean "wave-resounding" according to a gloss quoted s.v. by Windisch : dal is presumably dal, "an assembly": so that the literal meaning of the compound would be "assembly-wave-sounding." The metre of this "poem" is rather loose : here, as in quatrain 2, the lines end
in tri-syllables, while in the very unmelodious quatrain 4 they end in monosyllables.
(4) 1638. I do not understand fuirtiud. 1639. Belach Conglais is here ingeniously fitted into the intractable metre.
(5) 1643-4. This couplet is metrically faulty. It may perhaps be emended thus
Co Drobais drong-armglan Ris tiben[d in] sal. "To Drobais of multitudes of pure weapons upon which the
sea laughs."
(6). This quatrain as it stands is to me quite incomprehensible. It may be wilfully obscure, or it may be corrupt beyond emendation : in either case it is not worth wasting time over.
(7). The last two lines of this quatrain also appear hopeless. They have obviously parted company with the
metre altogether : I suspect that na liach is a gloss—its excision would emend the verse-construction to some extent, but it is not obvious what it may be supposed to
explain, nor yet how the sense is improved by its excision.
Metre : Presumably meant for Rannaigecht becc, but as the third line ends with a monosyllable the last couplet is in Rannaigecht cJiummaisc.

Metre : Hopelessly corrupt in this version, but apparently Debide scailte. Author Mac Liag. This poem has been published by Owen Connellan from
the R3 text (Ossianic Soc, v, p. 282) and later by Gwynn (Metrical Dindsenchus, iii, p. 440). The former is no longer
easily accessible, and is in some respects antiquated—the editor had a childlike (not to say puerile) faith in the historicity of the Fir Bolg and all their works : the latter is based upon a different recension of the text, and admittedly
ignores the LG version. It will therefore be useful to the student to be able to place the two texts side by side.
(1) 1659. The LG texts prefer the 3rd person dessid to
the 1st person dessad as in MD.
(2) 1664. Aidne, a district bordering on Galway Bay. (4) 1670. Breg, the plain south of and including Tara.
1671. Raith C (h)eltchair must be wrong: the only known
fort of that name was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Downpatrick (but is not to be identified with the large
Norman earthwork within the city). The Dindsenchus
reading R. Chennaig is certainly preferable. The identification of Raith Chomair is doubtful : Cnodba is of course the mound of Knowth, and Brug mna Elemair was somewhere in the same neighbourhood (not necessarily any mound
now in existence). (5). 1673. Oenach Taillten : the name remains at Teltown, Co. Meath, but there is little remaining to tell of its former local importance. Treb Cermna, which we may best render "the steading (or plough-lands) of Cermna" is unknown in Breg : the place or places called Dun Cermna were far distant. Ath Sidi, identified with a place near Tara called
Assrv, Bri Dam with Geashill in Offaly. The three Finds of Emain were the triplet sons of Eochu Feidlech, and alleged to have been collectively the father of Lugaid Sriab nDerg. It will be noted that the modest demand of these immigrants included every important sanctuary in the district : this can hardly be an accident.
(7). Fort-building was a stock form of forced labour, as



NOTES ON SECTION VI. 89
we learn from the legal documents. (See references in
Ancient Laics of Ireland, glossary, s.v. manchuine.)
(8) 1685. Mag Main in the neighbourhood of Loughrea,
Co. Galway. 1686. Druim Cain, an old name of Temair. 1687. Cruas fa thuind "hardness under a skin": a cheville difficult to construe without grotesqueness. 1688. The
rendering adopted for clesraig is an attempt—not, perhaps,
satisfying—to reproduce the sense of the collective noun.
(9). 1690. As there are no "waves" anywhere near Temair, we must render tonn as "surface."
(10) 1695. Benaim "to smite, to draw" and a variety of other meanings, might signify either they "trekked" to the west, or "squatted" there. The sense is vague. The Dindsenchus version, gabsat, is more definite.
(11"). Most of these places have been identified already in the notes on the prose text. 1698. Cutloch, abbreviated for Loch Cutra.
(12) 1701. Bail in Onom. Goed. regarded as accus. of
Dael = the river Deel, Co. Mayo. None of the other settlements are made on rivers, though there are some later settlements (crannogs ?) recorded in the list. 1703. Rind mBcra : Kinvarra, Co. Galway. 1701. Modlind is in the same
neighbourhood. (13) 1705. Cend mBoinie, Black Head in Burren. 1706. lath Oiejli, as Gwynn suggests, is presumably the territory surrounding Cruachan Oigli (Croagh Patrick). 1707. Laighlinni, identification uncertain : we have already heard of Loch Laighlinne, which is equally uncertain.
(14) 1710. Inis Medon, Inismaan in the Aran group. The
great fortification on that island, now called "Dun Conor,"
may perhaps echo the name of Concraide. A place called Tulach Tend was in the Munster province, in Corca Laige, which, however, would seem to be outside the jurisdiction and gift of the Connacht rulers.
(16). The quatrains which follow narrate events not contained in the prose text : this is an indication that the whole poem is an interpolation, as we might infer from its absence from some important mss.

(19) 1726. Imirche seems properly to mean a wandering, or an expedition : here it is used in the sense of ' ' wanderers. ' '
1727. The line is expressed with an ambiguity impossible to evade neatly in translation, but the sense in which it is to be taken is obvious.
(22) 1738. Cing, the reading of the Dindsenchas tradition, is preferable to Rind, as the latter name does not appear among the names of the claim of Umor.
(25) 1752. On Cam Conaill see the note to prose \\ 280 above.
(26). This quatrain is not in the Dindsenchus tradition.
Umall being the Mayo district now called "The Owles, " the fort and the "pile of heads" was presumably somewhere there.

genuine place-name. Hogan ignores it. It may possibly be meant, in general terms, as the source whence poets come.
LII.
Metre : a rather free Debide scailte (oglachas).
(1) 1763. The sense of this couplet seems to be: "I shall tell you by verses which will remain in your memory the stakes around which they meet" —i.e. the line of the boundarystockades. There is nothing else in the poem calling for
special notice ; we have already noticed all the geographical terms which it contains, and the chevilles with which they arc interspersed are of little interest.
(7) 1785. The stone in Uisnech is the famous erratic boulder called Aill na Mireann, on the slope of the hill, traditionally the meeting point of all the provincial divisions. See for descriptions and photograph, Proceedings R.I.A., XXXVIII, Section C, p. 78, plate V.
The only poems admitted by K are XLVI and XLVII, and a heavily-glossed composition also attributed to Tanaide o Maoil-Conaire in 23 quatrains beginning Ere dras na n-iorghal. This does not appear in any of the earlier texts.



INTRODUCTION. 91
SECTION VII.
TUATHA DE DANANN.
Introduction.
Beyond all doubt, this section is based upon a Theogonia,
most likely transmitted orally—less probably in writingin which the mutual relationships of the members of the pre-Christian pantheon were set forth. Unfortunately for the value of the compilation as a mythological handbook, the Euhemerist has "run amok" among these ancient deities: he has been desperately anxious to incur no suspicion of
propagating not quite forgotten heathenisms : and in consequence this, in many ways the most important section in the whole book, has become reduced to an arid list of names. But after all, even Hesiod himself, with the mighty literary engine of Greek hexameter verse at his disposal, did not
succeed in making a divine genealogy exhilarating ! The relation between the Redactions, and even between individual mss. in each Redaction, is here peculiarly com
plicated. R 3
, as usual, follows *Q in R1
, though, also as usual, with sufficient individuality, expressed by errors, omissions, and interpolations, to justify, if not to enforce, its
separate treatment. The mss. of R2 here fall into three
groups—VA, D, and ER, and have to be analysed separately. To this analysis we now proceed.
Of the three groups in R2
, ER presents us with the
shortest text : disregarding the appended Synchronisms it is
of about the same length as R1
. But when we compare
together ER and R1
, we find that they have only four paragraphs in common : the intervening material in each being quite different. At first sight we might be tempted to
suppose that the compiler of yER had set himself to prepare
a supplement to R1
, with only the minimum of necessary linkages between the texts : but such a hypothesis would be
altogether improbable. Far more likely—and more in
teresting—is the explanation that these four paragraphs were



92 SECTION VII.
the original nucleus of the section, and that all the rest of
the material has crystallized around them. R1 on the one
hand, yER on the other, developed in different schools, and
borrowed from different sources. As for VA and D, these also give us the four nuclear paragraphs; with linking
material, taken now from R1
, now from ER.
The following are the paragraphs of the nuclear text. For convenience of reference in the present discussion we
shall denote them as A, B, C, D ; using italic letters for purposes of distinction. In the text, to make these para
graphs conspicuous, they are printed in heavy-faced type :
A (R1
If 304, R :
If 320, R3
1f 356). The progeny of Betliach son of Iarbonel the Soothsayer were in the northern islands of the world, learning druidiy, till they were skilled in the arts of pagan cunning.
B (R1
If 309, R- 1| 322, 326, R3
If 361). They are the TDD (as we n. ay here abbreviate their clumsy name), who brought with them the
Lia Fail which was in Temair. He under whom it should shriek would be king of Ireland. It refused to shriek under Cu Chulaind or his fosterling : whereupon Cu Chulaind struck it, and it never shrieked again except under Conn, when its heart burst forth from Temair to Tailltiu.
C (R1 f 314, R= If 334, R3
If 366). The three sons of Cermat Milbel
son of The Dagda were Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, Mac Greine, and their wives were Fodla, Banba, and Eriu.
D (R1
If 317, R= If 344, R3
If 369). Brigid the poetess, daughter of
The Dagda, had certain supernatural animals, and, "after rapine," three demoniac shouts were heard among them.
Each of these four paragraphs has a certain individuality.
A
is a natural introduction to the subject, and stands at the head of the section in all MSS. B, C, D, though separated
by interpolated material, differing in each group of mss.,
follow in order—a striking contrast to the way in which the
other material is shuffled about. B and D contain the most obscure and archaic-looking statements in the whole of this mysterious section. C is a miniature DimcUcnclias, professing



INTRODUCTION. 93
to explain various names of Ireland. These paragraphs divide each version of the section into four parts.
Part I : J. and following paragraphs.
A
: slight verbal deviations in the three redactions. In
R

, an appendix parallel with, but not directly borrowed from

ft 322.
(a) In R1 the following material follows paragraph A
ft 305 (peculiar to F) an expansion of the statement in A
relating to the studies of the TDD in magic; enumerating the cities in which those studies were pursued, the magical objects which the scholars took away, and the sages under whom they received instruction.
ft 306, in L, a brief statement of their arrival in Ireland protected by what would now be called a smoke-screen. In F, added to this (a) a discussion of their nature (demons or men?) and (&) an alternative version of their arrival in ships which they burnt, so as to leave themselves no alternative to
a policy of "victory or death."
ft 307. The battle of Mag Tuired : they secure the
sovereignty of Ireland. Again L and F differ.
ft 308 (peculiar to F) : a notice of the fate of Eochu mac
Eire, the last king of the Fir Bolg, and of the subsequent adventures of Fir Bolg fugitives.
(b) ER inserts the following paragraphs between A
and B :
ft 321 : a story of battles between Athenians and
Philistines, and of the part which the TDD played in them, with their magic. Then, following ft 306, they come to



94 SECTION VII.
Ireland in their smoke-screen. D has an interpolation
betraying the influence of a ms. of the F type. But
fl 322 shows that the latter part of the preceding para
graph is an interpolation, for here we learn that the TDD
had not yet reached Ireland. We see them in flight from Greece to the mysterious "Dobur and Urdobur" in Alba; thence they come to Ireland in ships, which they burn on
landing.
(c) In VA the same paragraphs follow A, and are followed
by
1J323, the matter of R1
fl 305. This, being in F only, is
intrusive even in R1
. In R 1 the order of enumeration is
cities—magical things—sages : in VA it is cities—sagesmagical things. Here is a trace of a special source, which has itself had a certain evolutionary history. At first it was a list of cities and their sages : then the magical things were added in the margin, and finally taken into the text in two mss. (yi\ VVA) in different places. This interpolation is
entirely ignored in ER.
(d) If wre call these two interpolations a (Athenians and Philistines : invasion of Ireland) and (3 (cities, sages, and magical things) we shall find, when we turn to D, that it gives them in the reverse order, and that in verbal expression
and in the order of its statements it conforms to F as against VA. Clearly the eclectic scribe of this ms. took the para
graph, not from his R2 exemplar, but from a text of the R1
group—almost certainly the copy which in his time was contained in Lebor tia Huidri. The other interpolation (a) has here lost the details as to
the invasion of Ireland, for which D substitutes the long
account of this event given in the F version of TT 306, 307
(fl 327). This is inserted into VA after paragraph B.



INTRODUCTION. 95
Part II : B and following paragraphs.
In R2
, paragraph B is complete only in ER : in the other mss. of this redaction it has lost its opening sentence,
describing the importation of Lia Fail, this sentence having been superseded by the statement that the stone was brought
from Failias (H 328).
R
1 inserts :
\\ 310. Reigns of Nuadu Airgetlam and of Bress. fl311. The story of Tailltiu. H 312. List of the casualties in the battle of Mag Tuired. Reign of Lug. T[313. Reign of The Dagda.
R
2 has the ship-burning after B in VA, before it in D (*j 3:27, 327a). The remainder of this part of the text
resembles, in R 2
, the corresponding part in R1
, and (though it has a number of verbal divagations) is obviously not independent of it. The same cannot be said of ER, which
has a very summary list of the TDD kings (T[ 335) followed by a brief enumeration of the most important personages of the
TDD (ft 342). D later incorporates these two paragraphs, in
the same sequence, in the following part ; VA takes in ft 335,
but ignores fl 342. R 3
, as usual, follows R1 throughout.
Part III : C and following paragraphs.
In R2
, paragraph C appears in two versions (fl 334, 334a).
The shorter version (334a) appears in R1
, preceded and
followed by genealogical matter. In R2 the shorter version is peculiar to D, which gives the longer version later on (after
11 348).
R
1 then inserts :
ff 315. Reigns of Delbaeth, Fiacha, and the grandsons of The Dagda.
H 316. Detailed genealogy of TDD kings.
R
2 fills up the space between C and D with elaborate genealogical matter. All that is here necessary is a comparative

sources, a (340, 341), p (337, 338, 339) : 334, at the head of
each list, is the nuclear paragraph C. ER has a, (3, and an
additional fl343, not in VA. VA has fl 336 (not in ER), (3, a, and j| 335, borrowed from Part II in ER. In U, however, the
material is much disarranged, and is interpolated with
additional matter peculiar to that MS. We can, however, trace among these interpolations the series of E, 337, 338,
339, 343, in consecutive order. In this part R ! gives us a
much inflated version of R1

Part IV : D and following paragraphs.
This part presents us, in R 1 R3 but not in R2

of mss., but I] 34.") is absent from ER. R1 closes the section
with a colophon on the demonic nature of the TDD: Min inserts the irrelevant story of Tuirill Biccreo and his sons.
ER has a brief summary of the kings, with an interpolated
disquisition an the demonic nature of the TDD (ff 352-35.")).
This also appears in VA and D, preceded in all three mss.
by Tf 345, 349, 350, 351. The same colophon (fl 352-5),
omitting ff 354, is taken over into R3

The Theogonia.
R

ff 310-319. R2
I] 328-355. R 3
][ 362-372.
The Theogonia, despite the condensed and desperately confused form in which it is presented to us, is of such enormous importance, as the most complete documentary account of any European non-classical pantheon, that it calls for a special effort to get it into order. It would clearly be impossible in a brief essay to trace out all the ramifications of research which even such a dry list of names as this opens out for us : though our available materials are not as full as we should like, such a work would fill a volume of considerable size. Only a few of the most important matters can here be touched upon.
The confusion is due to the. compilers having unintelligently patched together scraps of documents as they came to hand, without the slightest regard to (a) repetitions, (&) contradictions, and (c) logical or systematic order. The Roll of the Kings affords a convenient basis on which to found our discussion.
Accordingly we begin with NUADU. This being is doubtless to be identified with Nodons, or Nodens, a deity
whose chief sanctuary known to us is the Romano-British temple at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire. 1 Unlike Lug, his cult does not appear to have left any certain traces among
the Continental Celts. The name appears several times in the Roll of the "Milesian" kings, and in most cases probably
refers to the same personality. Theories differ as to the department over which he presided : the sea-monsters depicted in the mosaic pavements at Lydney Park have suggested that
he was a sea-god; the "silver arm" conspicuous in his folk
lore being (rather fancifully) explained as a poetical description of a narrow strait of water between two islands. It has also been suggested that he was a patron of wealth
1 See W. H. Bathurst, Eoman Antiquities at Lydney Parle, Gloucestershire (London, 1879) : R. E. M; and T. V. Wheeler, Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Eoman, and Post-Eoman sites in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire (London, Society of Antiquaries, 1932).

(in cattle). There is little ground for these or any other
theories. A tablet found at Lydney Park invokes his aid in #
recovering a stolen ring (Bathurst, pi. xx). A bronze plaque from the same place (idem, pi. xiii) bears a representation of a draped divinity riding in a chariot drawn by four (sea-) horses and surrounded by tritons and other marine beings;
this may (or may not) be a representation of the divinity under discussion. But until many more discoveries are made,
these objects cannot be made to bear much weight of hypothesis, nor can we pursue in this place any line of inves
tigation that may be opened up by comparisons between the
name of Nuadu and the Brythonic Nudd and Ludd. In our
present text Nuadu has been king of the TDD for seven years before their arrival in Ireland : captures the country in the first battle of Mag Tuired, but loses his arm in the fight;
and is consequently disqualified from sovereignty (a fact tacitly assumed, but not categorically stated). Thanks to the supernatural skill of his leeches, he recovers his arm and regains his kingdom after some years, holding it other 20 years : after which he meets his death in the second battle of Mag Tuired. Undoubtedly the "silver arm," which is his
prominent characteristic, had an important place in his mythology; but what we are told about it in the extant documents is of little greater scientific value than the ludicrous
parody irrelevantly prefixed to the modern version of the story called Oidheadh Cloinne Tuireann. The pedigree of Nuadu is here traced back to' Noah, through Iarbonel son of Nemed. For our present purpose
the later steps alone are important
12 Bethach



INTRODUCTION. 99
Nuadu's forced retirement, the result of his mutilation at
Mag Tuired—an event the significance of which could be made the theme of endless more or less unprofitable specu
lation—leaves the throne vacant for BRESS, in some texts
called Bresal, who holds office for a term of seven years. There is a suggestion of some kind of periodicity in the coincidence that Nuadu's reign had lasted for the same length of time before his misfortune (a recurrent feast at which the
king- god was replaced?). Bress comes of an important family. He is one of the five sons of Elada or Eladan, s. Net s. Indui ;• the last-named is the fifth step in the Nuadu pedigree as numbered above.
If we were to press these genealogical relationships to their literal extremity, we should describe Nuadu as "second cousin once removed 7 '
to Bress; but such efforts very soon land us
in all manner of chronological and other impossibilities. In fact, the pedigree of Elada is not given consistently : a certain Delbaeth is, in some versions, interposed between him and
Net, and this is on the whole more nearly correct—if indeed questions of "correctness'' enter at all into these pseudo
traditional artificialities. At least it is more consistent with
ordinary genealogical probability.
The five sons of Elada are enumerated thus—Eochu Ollathair, Ogma, Elloth, Bress, Delbaeth. The last-named is a second Delbaeth, differing from the person just mentioned : one of several doublets which add to the confusion. In F,
ff 316, Elloth (also spelt Ellodh, Alloth) is called Delbaetha third Delbaeth, and a. second in the brotherhood : but this is doubtless a scribe's mistake. Of these, the first two are
undoubtedly deities : Elloth, in the form (genitive) Motto, appears as a family ancestral name on some Ogham in
scriptions in Kerry, thereby creating the presumption that this also is a divine name; and though the other two are not so obviously divine, their associations almost compel us to
enrol them in the pantheon. This is emphasised by the wild tale of the contest in magic between Bress and Lug, as
narrated in DincUenchus of Cam ui Neit (R.C., xv, p. 438;
Gwynn, MD, iii, p. 46). Lug prepared in a certain place
300 wooden cows full of red bogwater instead of milk ; Bress,
who was under a gets to drink anything that should be milked



100- SECTION VII.
in that place, drank off the 300 bucketfuls of bogwater, and,
naturally, died. The event is mentioned in R2
(ff 329) and
by K, though for full details we must go to Dindsenckus :
R
1 and R3 ignore the tragedy and tell us (ff 312, 361) that Bress was killed in the second Mag Tuired battle.
Meanwhile Nuadu had been healed by Creidne the crafts
man and Dian Cecht the leech, who with Goibniu the smith and Luichne the wright make a quaternity of departmental deities usually grouped together. They are sons of Esaire
or Esairg (in R1
fl 316 wrongly Erairc), son of Net. That Miach, son of Dian Cecht, substituted an arm of flesh for the arm of silver, and that his father slew him in jealousy (as Apollo slew Aesculapius), are later embellishments of the tale. Ogma, the brother of Bress, met his death in the second battle of Mag Tuired along with Nuadu, and, therefore, had
no opportunity of gaining a place in the list of kings. He is presumably to be identified with the Gaulish god Ogmios,
of whom some enigmatical details are preserved for us in Lucian 's well-known essay on ' ' Herakles ' '
: that he was the inventor of the Ogham alphabet is of course a mere
etymological Spielerei. He is slain in battle by "Hindech mac De Domnann," as Nuadu is slain by Balor the Strong
smiter. As we find that Lug, who procured the death of Bress, was Balor 's grandson, and that he went to Hindech to gain particulars as to the number of casualties in the battle (see notes on ]j 312), we are led to suspect that the
TDD pantheon was not a united whole any more than the Greek pantheon ; and to infer that it had likewise come into
being as a result of fusions, in prehistoric times, of population-groups, each with its own gods, and not always on terms of mutual friendship. Ogma had a son, who later became king, and who bore the family name Delbaeth; and another son Ollom. According
to R1
ff 315, Delbaeth and the six sons of Ollom were killed
by a certain Caieher s. Nama s. Eochu Garb s. Dui Temen
s. Bress; elsewhere we read of. a single person, Ai son of Ollom, and we infer that some scribe has misread this name
as a. numeral, "ui." Erom a long interpolation in R3
ff 368, which evidently comes from an independent and sometimes contradictory source, we learn that Ogma 's wife was Etan



INTRODUCTION. 101
daughter of Dian Cecht, and that they had another son Tuirenn. 2 When Nuadu died, the kingdom passed once more to the
dynasty of Net; and Lug succeeded. Nuadu 's second term of office had lasted 20 years : Lug doubled that (40 years) ;
and his successor "In Dagda" doubled it again—another suggestion of periodicity. Lug is one of the most familiar of the Celtic divinities, and his cult extended over the whole area dominated by the Celtic languages. There is some reason to believe that he was a solar deity : he appears in Welsh literature as LJew, on votive inscriptions in the plural form Lugoves, and his name enters as an element in place names (Lugudununi, Luguselva) and in personal names (Trenalugos, Luguaedon, Lugu-dex). The Dindsenchus material regarding Tailltiu, interpolated in all three redactions of LCI (Tf 311, 330, 363), is essentially an account of the traditional origin of his cult, and of its chief centre. The story of the birth of Lug from Balor's daughter, a folk-tale of the Danae-and-Perseus type, is well known ; and
it is familiar to our compilers, who tell of Lug's slaying his
grandfather Balor with a sling-stone (fl 312). But the inter
polation in U 368 tells us another tale—that Ethliu, whose son Lug was, was not his mother but his father, and was identical with Cian son of Dian Cecht, otherwise called Seal Balb. Lug himself appears as a "seal" or apparition, in the story called Baih an Scdil, when he introduces himself to Conn as "son of Ethliu son of Tigernmas." Quite clearly in this interpolation the walls of partition between the
various epic cycles are breaking down—a process completed
in the rubbish called " Macpherson 's Ossian, " where we see the final degradation of Gaelic tradition. In this interpolation, further, Lug is credited with three sons, Ainnli
( = one of the three sons of Uisnech), Cnu Deroil ( = Crom Deroil, a druid appearing in the tale called Mesca Ulad),

wife of "Alexander son of Priam"—with whom we enter the thicket of nonsense about Brutus and the Trojans with which
early British history used to be pestered. 3
EOCHU, surnamed OLLATHAIR "the great father,"
N also called IN DAGDA MOR "the great good god," succeeds Lug. These names are quite enough to convince us of his divinity: in spite of which he finally dies of wounds that have been inflicted upon him in the second battle of Mag
Tuired— 120 years before ! He has three sons—the mysterious
Oengus mac ind 6c, otherwise Oengus in Broga, a name connecting him with the important cemetery called Brug na
Boinnc near Drogheda, persistently associated in tradition with In Dagda and his family : Ord, which means "fire" : and Cermat Coem, the father of the three sons with whom, 49
years later, the TDD monarchy terminated. These three youths, according to ]\ 314, killed Lug in Uisnech ; a further example of the way in which all reasonable chronology is thrown to the winds in the compilation in its present form. In a
combination of genealogical and quasi-historical material, compiled from various independent and not always concordant sources, such bewildering anomalies are almost inevitable.4
Besides these sons In Dagda has a daughter—the important
fire-goddess Brigid. Here again we have a universal deity,
found everywhere in Celtic countries—as Brigindo, as the eponymous deity of the Brigantes, and in other connexions
which need not here be enumerated : and here also, we find
evidence of a plurality of Brigids, analogous to the plurality of Lugs. Most likely In Dagda himself was a fire-, or
perhaps a storm-divinity.
3 The plurality of Lug attested by certain continental inscriptions seems to suggest the development of one entity out of an indefinite number of elemental beings, analogous to the Matres, or to the "fairies" of modern tradition. The apparent plurality of Delbaeth may conceivably point in the same direction.
' Kven Holy Writ itself is not exempt from this risk. Genesis xliii-xliv shows us Benjamin as a youth of such tender years that his lather is unwilling to let him go to Egypt. Chap, xlv describes the happy reunion which leads to Jacob's transporting himself and his
family to Egypt; and there we are surprised to find Benjamin the father of no fewer than ten sons.



INTRODUCTION. 103
Little need be said about the two divinities who follow
in the roll of the kings—DELBAETH son of Ogma or of
Elada—the ambiguity matters little, as these individuals are practically certain to be different aspects of the one
personality : and his son FIACHU (aliter Fiachra or Fiachna). These reign for ten years each. The former is
chiefly important for the family attributed to him. He has three daughters, the famous war-furies Badb, Macha, and
Mor-rlgu, the latter sometimes called Anand or Danand, which is, in fact, her real name, Mor-rlgu being merely an epithet ("great queen") 5
. Their mother is Ernmas, a
daughter of Etarlam, Nuadu 's grandfather : and Macha is
killed along with Nuadu in the second battle of Mag Tuired at the hands of Balor. It is, however, reasonable to equate her to the Macha of Ard-Macha, who died after the race in which she gave birth to the '•'twins of Macha," from which
Emain Macha takes its name. Danand or Dana is the eponym
of the two remarkable mountains called "the Paps of Dana" in Co. Kerry. Her father Delbaeth had by her the three famous sons Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba, The two latter are obviously the objects of a twin-cult : and in his capacity
of father to these beings—who were of a divinity so sublimated that they are spoken of as "the gods of the
TDD"—Delbaeth also bears the name of Turenn or Turell Piccreo. Three other sons also born of Ernmas, are Fiachu (the king), Ollam, and Indai. There is also a daughter called Elcmar, who marries Net; evidently Net II, great-grandson of Net I, if we may believe a pedigree included in the interpolation of ff 368. But Net I was the eponym of Ailech Neit, and we learn from ff 314 that Fea and Nemaind (sic) were
his wives—who would thus appear to have been their own
great-great-great-great-grandmothers : a complication which could not occur except in an Olympus of cli immortales, as conceived of by some community in which the doctrine of
re-birth was a cardinal article of faith. 6 Elsewhere Fea

104 SECTION VII.
and Neman appear as Badb and Nemain (fl 338); and as Mor-rigu is sometimes called Neman, the identity of these
two women with two of the three war-furies, daughters of
Delbaeth, is complete. Moreover, they can hardly be
dissociated from Fea and Femen, the sacred cattle which
were in some way "possessed" by Brigid daughter of
In Dagda : and we must not forget that Fea has already appeared in the book, in connexion with Partholon.
At the end of the list of kings comes the interesting trio
MAC CUILL, MAC CECHT, MAC GREINE : unquestion
ably to be identified with the beings alleged to be their
"gods," from whom they derived their names, and thus to be regarded as departmental divinities of a simple agricultural community. Their personal names, like those of Iuchar and Iucharba, have the characteristic Dioscuric
jingle—whether we accept them in the form (S)ethor, Tethor,
and Cethor, or Ermat, Dermat, and Aed—for the last we are probably to substitute Cermat, the name of the alleged father; possibly he and Aed (another son of In Dagda) have changed relationships. Their wives are the eponymous
heroines of Ireland, whom we have already met in the Cessair section. These "gods-of-gods" are doubtless to be ultimately equated with the Brian triad, whose divinity is of the same transcendent order.
The set of verses enumerating these three kings does not belong to the context in which we find it here, for it mentions
a fourth on equal terms with them, by name MANANNAN. It is clear that the historians were puzzled by this personage, whom, on the evidence of the materials at their disposal, whatever those might have been, they could not accept as a
king. He is identified with Oirbsiu, genitive Oirbsen, the eponym of the lake now called Loch Corrib : and he is regarded as son of Allot, the most obscure of all the five sons of Elada. According to U 339 he was killed by Uillend of the Red Edge son of Caicher, who killed the king Delbaeth, ;iiid is hardly to be identified with the "Milesian" druid
of whom we heard in § II : the interpolativc material in R 3 makes Uillend to be son of Tadc Mor, an otherwise unrecorded son of Nuadu, and his victim is variously styled Gallia, or



INTRODUCTION. 105
Gaiar, or Oirbsen, or Manannan. In fi 348 "Gaela" is son of Oirbsen.
For the present, the foregoing analysis must suffice. It is enough to show that these pedigrees are a highly complex
synthesis of genuine traditional material—for it it were not so, the details would necessarily have been fabricated, and the romancers would at least have taken pains to avoid the absurd chronological disunities which have been pointed out. These are inevitable in any effort to combine irreconcilable
traditions, which have come to birth in different communities,
and which have been developed artificially by different schools of historians : and when we find them, we are justified in thus explaining them.

the world, learning drnidry and knowledge and prophecy and magic, till they were expert in the arts of pagan
cunning. 305. There were four cities in which they were acquiring knowledge and science and diabolism : these are their names,
Failias, Goirias, Findias, Muirias. From Failias was brought the Lia Fail which is in Temair, and which used to utter a
cry under every king that should take Ireland. From Goirias was brought the spear which Lug had : battle would never go
against him who had it in hand. From Findias was brought
the sword of Xuadu : no man would escape from it ; when it
was drawn from its battle-scabbard, there was no resisting it. From Muirias was brought the cauldron of The Dagda ; no company would go from it unsatisfied. There were four sages
in those cities : Morfesa, who was in Failias, Esrus in Goirias, Usicias in Findias, Semias in Muirias. Those are the four poets, with whom the Tuatha De Danann acquired knowledge and science.

Another company says that the

sea-expedition, and that they burnt their ships thereafter. It was owing to the fog of smoke that rose from them as they were burning that others have said that they came in a fog of smoke. Not so, however : for these are the two reasons why they burnt their ships : that the Fomoraig
should not find them, to rob them of them; and that they themselves should have no way of
escape from Ireland, even though they should suffer rout before the Fir Bolg. Thereafter the

heavy loss in the battle. Everyone who escaped of the Fir Bolg and of any of them ( ?) who had no desire to be in servitude
to the Tuatha De Danann, went out from Ireland in flight, and
came into Ara. and Islay and Kachra and Man and islands of the sea besides. They were in those islands till the time
when the provincial kings ruled Ireland, and the Cruithne drave them out of the islands. Thereafter they came to Coirpre Nia Fer, and he gave them land : but they could not remain with him for the severity of the tax which was imposed upon them. Thereafter they went in flight from Coirpre under the protection of Medb and Ailell, and they gave them land. That
is the wandering of the sons of Umor. Oengus son of Umor
was king over them in the east, and from them are named the
territories, to wit Loch Cimme, from Cimme the Four-Headed,
son of Umor, was it named, and Rind T amain in Medraige from Tamain, and the Fort of Oengus in Ara from Oengus, and the
stone-heap of Conall in the territory of Aidne from Conall, and Mag Adar from Adar, and Mag Assal in Mumu,
further, from Assal; Maen son of Umor was the bard. The sons of Umor were in those places and in the islands round about Ireland till the Ulaid accompanying Cu Chulaind quenched them.

who slept with Eochu Garb son of Dni Dall of the Tuatha De Danann; and Cian son of Dian Cecht, whose other name was Seal Balb, gave her his son in
fosterage, namely Lug, whose mother was Eithne daughter of Balar. So Tailltiu died in Tailltiu, and her name clave thereto and her grave is from the Seat of Tailltiu north-eastward.
Her games were performed every vear and her song of

were they performed, a fortnight before Lugnasad and a fortnight after : unde

Ireland until the Tuatha De Danann slew him. It is [Eochu] son of Ere who took her from Spain from
her father, Mag Mor the

Lug son of Ethliu, lie is the first who invented assembly and horseraeimg and combat of horses, as one said Poem no. LV.
Those are the Tuatha De Danann : gods were the people of art, but
non-gods were the three gods of Danu, from whom are named the husband
men .i. the gods. These were the three gods of Danu from whom they were named, to wit the three sons of Bres son of Elatha, or the three sons of Tuirell Biccreo, Brian, Iuchar, Iucharba. Rabb, Brott, Robb, their three buffoons. Fiss, Fochmarc, Eolas, their three druids. Dub, Dobur, Doirche, their three cup-bearers. Saith, Leor, Linad, their three apportioners. Feic, Ruse, Radarc, their three sentinels. Talc, Tren, Tres, their three henchmen. Attach, Gaeth, Sidhe, their three horses. Aig, Taig, Tairchell, their three hounds. Ceol, Binn, Tetbinn, their three harpers. Gle, Glan, Gleo, their three well-springs. Braid, Ordan, Togad, their three foster-fathers. Sid, Sairae, Suba, their three foster-mothers. Cumna, Set, Samail, their three goblets. Mell, Tete, Rochain, their three game-fields. Aine, Indmas, Brugas, their three ridges, (<i) Cain, Alaig, Rochain, their three forts*.
318. Others say that they were demons, for they knew that human bodies were around them, which is more correct : for their genealogies are reckoned back, and they were in existence at the time of the coming of Faith. So that of their fates Flann Mainistrech sang the following song,
in testimony thereto

319. The adventures of Tuirill Biccreo and of his sons, Brian, Iuchar,
and Iucharba. This is what will here be related: Now Delbaeth s. Ogma had the name of Tuirill Piccreo, and it is his sons who slew Ethlend father of Lug, whose name was Cian, when he went in the form of a lapdog (<?) lo the Brug. So Lug came to avenge his father upon them, or till they
should pay him the wergild for him. And this is the wergild which he

1. The two horses of the king- of the Island of Sicily on the Torrian Sea.
Gaine and Rea are their names, and wounds, waves, or lightning hurt them not. 2. The spear of Assal of ridgy red gold: he lives not whose blood it
sheddeth : and no cast goeth amiss so long as one saith ' ' Yew !
''
of it; but when one saith "Re- Yew! " it goeth backward forthwith. 3. The skin of the Pig of Duis : every one whose side should come upon
it was healed of Ms wound and of Ms sickness: and it had the greatness of four hides of old oxen. i. The six pigs of Essaeh. They were slaughtered every Mght, and if their bones were kept without breaking or gnawing, they would survive alive every day. 5. The whelp of the royal smith of loruath, a hound by night and a sheep by day. Every water which is cast upon it becomes wine.
C. And the revealing of the island of Caire Cendflnne winch is under concealment between Eire and Alba. 7. And the harvest of apples that are under the sea near to that island. With those things was the wergild of the father of Lug paid.
Of the sickness of TMrill Biccreo, and of his adventures. He sought everything patent and hidden for its healing, and found it not, till Dian
Cecht cured him, for Etan his mother was Dian Cecht 's daughter. He made an emetic draught for him, so that he vomited forth three belches
i'lom his mouth. Where he drank the draught was in Cnoc Uachtar
Arehae : and three belches burst forth from Ms mouth, a cold belch in Loch Uair, an iron belch in Loch Iairn, and a . . . belch in Loch Aininn,
and, according to this story, it is thence they [the lakes] take their names.

320. The Taking of the Tuatha De Danann here below. The progeny of Bethach s. Iarbonel the Soothsayer s.
Nemed were in the northern islands of the world, learning the devil's druidry, till they were expert in every craft of their pagan cunning, and in every diabolic art of
druidry.
321. And there they were, between the Athenians and the Philistines. And there used to be a battle every day between the Athenians and the Philistines at that time, till the Athenians*") dwindled away, all but a small remnant. For the Tuatha De Danann used to fashion demons in the bodies of the Athenians, so that they used to come every day to battle. To the Philistines that was a marvel, and they came to the druid
who was in the land, and they said unto him : We marvel, that the men whom we slay every day [and every night] should [be the first to] come to battle with us on the morrow. Their elder gave them counsel, saying unto them : Take with you

skewers of hazel and quicken to the battle to-morrow, and if the battle break before you, thrust in those skewers behind the necks of the men whom you shall slay. If they be demons, they shall become heaps of worms. Thereafter the Philistines came to the battle on the morrow, and it broke before them, and they
thrust those points in behind the necks of the men whom they slew, and they became heaps of worms on the morrow. After
that the Philistines assembled together to slay the Tuatha De Danann. These came in terror before them, and by their druidry and fightings they fashioned demons^ ; and the first company of them came to Ireland [afterwards, (as) the Tuatha De, and their origin is unknown whether they were of demons or of men : howbeit they are of the progeny of Bethach son of Iarbonel the Soothsayer. In this wise they came,] without
ships or barks, in clouds of fog [over the air, by their might of druidry], and so they descended on a mountain of Conmaicne Rein in Connachta.
322. There is the course and the cause of their emprise, after their education : [others say that it was in ships that
they all came] . However, they had completed all their education among the Greeks, and they took territory and estate in the north of Alba, at Dobar and Urdobar, for seven years,
Nuadu being king over them. And they came to Ireland, on
Monday, the kalends of May, in ships [and vessels]. And

they burn their ships, and advanced unperceived by the Fir
Bolg, till they landed on Sliab in Iairnn. And they formed a
fog for three days and three nights over sun and moon, and
demanded battle or kingship of the Fir Bolg. And the battle of Mag Tuired was fought between them, as we have said above,
and afterwards one hundred thousand of the Fir Bolg were
slaughtered there.
Thereafter the Tuatlia De Danann took the kingship of Ireland. It is they who brought with
them the Stone of Fal, which was in Temair, unde dicitur Inis Fail ut Cinaed cecinit

(a) The text has been corrupted in D at this point and clumsily corrected. The
scribe's eye wandered from Temraig to Lug, a few lines further down, and he wrote
on, ni gebthi . . . i mbith (sic) laim. He then realized that something was wrong,
and wrote -\ bai ic Lug above bai i Temraig. Further examination showed him that
this did not correct the error, so he enclosed the words which he had written
prematurely in an oblong frame, as though to exclude them, and proceeded unde
dicitur, etc., as he should have done at first.

no victory could be won against it, nor against him who had it in hand. From Finnias was brought the sword of Nuadu

Inis
That stone used to utter a
cry under every king that should take Ireland. From Goirias was brought the spear which Lug had : no battle
would go against it, nor against him who had it in hand. From Finnias was brought the
sword of Nuadu ; no man escaped from it when it was
drawn from its battle-scabbard, and there was no resisting it. From Muirias was brought the cauldron of the Dagda; no company would go from it unsatisfied.
326. He under whom that stone should cry was king of Ireland. But Cu Chulaind struck it with
his swTord, for that it made no cry under him nor under his fosterling, Lugaid, son of the three
Finns of Emain : [and from that out it never
made cry save only under Conn]. And so its heart burst out of it from Temair to Tailltiu : therefore "Fal's Heart" is in Tailltiu. [But it was not Lugaid 's failure to take the kingship which was the occasion of the breaking of the idols, but Christ's birth at that time.]

327. Another company says, however, that it was as a sea
expedition the Tuatha De Danann came to Ireland, and burnt
their ships. It was owing to the fog of smoke that rose from them as they were burning that others have said that they eame in a fog of smoke. Not so, however, for these are the two
reasons why they burnt their ships—that the Fomoraig should
not find them to rob them of them, and that they themselves should not have a way of escape from Ireland, even though they should suffer rout before the Fir Bolg. TJnde dicitur
Poem no. LIX.
[Thereafter the Tuatha De Danann brought a darkness over the sun for a space of three days and three nights.]
327a. Follows 327 in D only. Owing to the injured state of the parchment the first few lines are very hard to read. It repeats with slight verbal
differences most of If 322; the translation need not be repeated. The passage here printed in square brackets is. written on the upper margin of the MS., and there is no indication of where it was intended to come in the text: but comparison with If 322 shows that it must be here. The
quotation of Cinaed ua Hartacain and his quatrain are here omitted: D has them in f 325. \\ 326 then follows. Interlined with the first sentence of this intrusive paragraph are the words, all but illegible, ar is oco batar brechta druad -\ arad n ouid cuidcairi. The bottom of the leaf seems to have been exposed at some time to fire, which has stained and distorted the t ellum.
328. As for Nuadu Airgetlam, it is he who was king over the Tuatha De Danann for seven years before they came into Ireland, till his arm was cut from him in the first battle of Mag Tuired. It is Eidleo son of Allda who was the first man
that fell in Ireland of the Tuatha De Danann, by the hand of Nerchu ua Semeoin, in the first battle of Mag Tuired. Ernmas, Echtach, Etargal, and Fiacha fell in the same battle.

353. Though some say that the Tuatha De Danann were
demons, seeing that they came unperceived [and they themselves said that it was in dark clouds that they came, after burning their ships] and for the obscurity of their knowledge
and adventures, and for the uncertainty of their genealogy as carried backwards : but that is not true, for their genealogies carried backward are sound : howbeit they learnt knowledge and poetry; for every obscurity of art and every clearness of
reading, and every subtlety of crafts, for that reason, derive
their origin from the Tuatha De Danann. And though the Faith came, those arts were not put away, for they are good, and no demon ever did good. It is clear therefore from their dignities and their deaths that the Tuatha De Danann were not of the demons nor were they sidh-folk. It is said that Bethach s. Iardan was chieftain of that Taking and of the arts, and
that seven chieftains followed him—Dagda, Dian Cecht, Creidne,
Luchne, Nuadu Argatlam, Lug s. Cian, Goibniu s. Ethliu;
de quibus the seven sons of EthliuPoem no. LX.

357. The four cities in which they were acquiring knowledge and science and diabolism, these are their
names; Failias, Goirias, Findias and Murias. From Failias was brought the Lia Fail which is in Temair, and it would not utter a cry but under every king that should take Ireland,
but [read and] from it is Inis Fail [and Mag Fail] named : unde dicitur
Poem no. LVIII.
From Goirias was brought the spear which Lug had :
battle would never go against him who had it in hand.
From Findias was brought the sword of Nuadu, and
no man would escape from it by reason of its venom,
and when it was drawn from its battle-scabbard there was no resisting it. From Muirias was brought the cauldron of The Dagda : no company would go from it unsatisfied. There were four sages in those cities :
Morfessa who was in Failias, Esrus in Goirias, Usicias in Findias, Semias in Murias. Those are the four
poets, with whom the Tuatha De Danann acquired
wisdom and knowledge :
wherefore this was said

clouds over the air, by the might of druidry, and they
landed on a mountain of Conmaicne Rein in Connachta, that is the Mountain of the sons of Delgaid in Conmaicne Rein, or Conmacne Cuile.
The Fir Bolg were there, and they saw a great cloud of
mist upon the Mountain of Conmaicne. It settled down on
the mountain a day and a night, [Such was the greatness
of the mist that they fear]<a^ed greatly before it, and not a man dared to go near the mountain. They approached it
afterwards on the second day, and saw the troops on the mountain after that cloud, and their number was greater than
was apparent. But another company says that the Tuatha De
Danann came in a sea-expedition into Ireland, and that
they burnt their ships thereafter, and that it was owing
to the fog of smoke that rose from them as they were
burning that others have said that they came in that fog. Not so, however ; for these are the two reasons why they burnt their ships : that the Fomoraig should not find them to rob them of them, and that they themselves should not find them to flee from Ireland, even though the rout should fall upon them at the hands of the Fir
Bolg.
The third reason was, lest Lug should find them, to do
battle against Nuadu son of Echtaeh, king of the Tuatha De Danann. So that of those reasons the learned sang

for the severity of the tax that was imposed upon them.
Thereafter they went in flight from Coirpre under the
protection of Medb and Ailill ; and they gave them land.
That is the wandering of the Sons of Umor. Oengus s.
Umor was king over them in the east. From them are
named the territories, Loch Cimme, from Cimme the
Four-headed s. Umor was it named, and the Headland of Tainan in Medraige from Tainan s. Umor, and the
Fort of Oengus in Ara from Oengus [s. Umor] and the
stone-heap of Conall in the territory of Aidne from
Conall, and Mag Adar from Adar, and Mag Assail in
Mumu from Assal. Moen s. Umor was the bard. So the sons of Umor were in those islands round about Ireland, till the Ulaid in the company of Cu Chulaind
quenched them. 361. It is the Tuatha De Danann who brought with them the Great Fal that was in Temair, i.e. the Lia Fail
Fis, whence is "Mag Fail" the name of Ireland. He
under whom it should utter a cry was king of Ireland :
till Cu Chulaind struck it, for it cried not under himself nor under his fosterling, Lugaid son of the three Finds
of Emain. And the stone made no cry from that out, save only under Conn. Its heart burst forth from it from Temair to Tailltiu, so that is the "Heart of Fal." However it is not that the idols broke, and that Lugaid obtained no kingship, but Christ being born at
that time.
Though Lugaid Red-stripe was foster to Cu Chulaind, he
was older than Cu Chulaind. Lugaid Red-stripe was a pupil
in martial matters of Cu Chulaind.

362. Nuadu Airgetlam, he it is who was king over the Tuatha De Danann there, seven years before their coming
into Ireland, till his arm was cut from him in the battle
of Mag Tnired. Eidleo s. Aldai he is the first man who
fell in Ireland of the Tuatha De Danann, by the hand
of Nerchu grandson of Semeon, in the first battle of
Mag Tuired : and Ernmas and Echtach and Etargal and
Fiacha fell. Bres s. Elada took the kingship of Ireland
thereafter, till the end of seven years, until the arm of
Nuadu was adjusted. Nuadu Argetlam was king there
after twenty years. He had a silver arm with full
activity in both finger and joint. Dian Cecht the leech
adjusted it, and Credne the wright was helping him in the matter of that silver arm. But Miach s. Dian Cecht set joint to its joint and vein to its vein in his own arm, and it was healed in thrice nine days; and he gave his
silver arm to him as reward.
363. As for Tailltiu daughter of Magmor king of
Spain, queen of the Fir Bolg, she came, after the setting of that battle of Mag Tuired against the Fir Bolg, to Coill
Cuain, and the wood was cleared by them, (a) so that
it was a clovery plain by the end of a year. This is that
Tailltiu who was wife of Eochu s. Ere, king of Ireland,
till the Tuatha De Danann slew him,
in the first battle of Mag Tuired, and he is the first man
who died of a spear-point in Ireland at the beginning, ut poeta dixit

from Mag Mor the Slow, from Mag Mor, from the
king of Spain king of Spain, [namely]
Tailltiu. It is Eochu s. Ere who was the first king
of the Fir Bolg who sat in
the beginning in Temair, even though he was their last king : and in his time
the Mound of the Three Men was erected upon Temair, and the Stone Heap of the One Man.
Druim Cain was its name before the time of the Fir
Bolg at the beginning.
Now Tailltiu daughter of
Now Tailltiu— Mag Mor
dwelt in Tailltiu, and slept with Eochu Garb s. Dui Dall
of the Tuatha De Danann : and Cian s. Dian Cecht
Seal Balb was Ms other name—gave her his son in
fosterage, namely Lug. He was son of Ethne daughter of Balar of the Strong Blows : the Illdanach. Whence it is said, if one have many arts, let
him merit many recompenses. So she died thereafter in Tailltiu, and her name was given thereto, and that is her grave which is north-east
from the Seat of Tailltiu, so that her games were celebrated every year by Lug, a fortnight before Samain
{read Lugnasad) and a fortnight after, so that thence
comes [the word] Lugnasad, i.e. the nasad of Lug s.
Ethliu [is] the name of that festivity.

364. Nuadu Airgedlam fell in the last battle of Mag
Tuired, and Macha daughter of Ernmas, by the hand
of Balar of the Strong Blows, in that battle. Ogma s. Elada s. Net fell at the hands of Indech the Great, son
of De Domnann, king of the Fomoraig. It is in that
same battle that there fell Brnidne and Casmael [the two satirists] by the hand of Oilltriallach s. Indech.
Now after the death of Nuadu and of those men in that battle, the Tuatha De Danann gave the kingship to Lug;
and his grandfather, Balar grandson of Net, fell at his hands by a stone from his sling. Many were slain in
that battle, both Tuatha De Danann and Fomoraig, and
Bres along with them. As Indech the Great, son of
De Domnann, the king said—he was a man with arts of
poetry and craft—when Lug asked of him, How many
were there who fell in the battle of Mag Tuired!—Seven
men, seven score, seven hundred, seven fifty, fifty, nine
hundred, twenty hundred, forty with Net, ninety—that is, with Ogma s. Elathan s. Net. Wherefore this was said in confirmation.
Poem no. LXIV.
Lug s. Ethliu was forty years in the kingship of Ireland after the last battle of Mag Tuired. There were twenty
seven years between those two battles of Mag Tuired.
365. Eochaid Ollathair, the Great Dagda s. Elada, was
eighty years in the kingship of Ireland. He had the three sons, Oengus, Aed, and Cermat the fair. Upon
those four did the men of Ireland make the Mound of the Brug.

Xuadu was twenty years in the kingship of Ireland, id dixi, till he fell in the last battle of Mag Tuired at
the hands of Balar. Forty years had Lug, till the three sons of Cermat slew him in Caendruim, that is in Uisnech. Eighty had the Dagda, till he died of the
gory javelin wherewith Cethlenn mortally wounded him in the great battle of Mag Tuired.

hands of Caicher s. Nama, brother of Nechtan. Fiaeha s. Delbaeth took the kingship of Ireland after his father, ten other years, till Fiaehna and the son of Ollam fell at the hands of Eogan of Inber Mor. Twenty-nine years
had the grandsons of The Dagda in the kingship of
Ireland, to wit Mac dull, Mae Cecht, and Mac Greine. They divided Ireland into three parts between them, and

Nuadu Argetlamh had four sous—Tadg the Great, father of
Uillend: this- is that Uillend s. Tadg s. Nuadu who slew Gaillia or
Gaiar or Oirbsen, i.e. Manannan the Great s. Allot the famous chapman.
Nuadu 's other three sons were Caither, Cueharn, and Etarlam the poet. Carpre the poet s. Tuar s. Tuirend s. Cait Coiditchend s Ordan.
These are the two sons of Ordan, Etarlam the grandfather of Nuadu Argetlam and Cait Coititcend grandfather of Cairpre the poet. The three sons of Telle s. Cait Coiditcend were Caither and Nechtan and Enna.
The five sons of Lotan the Swift were Morann the Great and Cairpre Cael-riarach and Eadub and Ollam : that is one of the two Ollams ascribed to the Tuatha De Danann, Ollam s. Lotan the Swift and Ollam s. Delbaeth.
The four sons of Cian Ciall were Morann and Merad and Calad and Tallad : that is one of the two Moranns of the Tuatha De Danann, Morand s. Cian Chaill and Morand s. Lodan.
The four sons of Esarg s. Net s. Indai were Dian Cecht the leech
and Luchraid the wright and Credne the carpenter and the One Smith of Hiruath.
The four sons of Dian Cecht were Cu and Cian and Cethen and Miach the leech. The two daughters of Dian Cecht were Ainned the shedeech and Etan the poetess. The two sons of Etan were Dealbaeth Dana s. Ogma Grianainech and Cairpre the poet. This is one of the two Tuirenns of the Tuatha De Danann, Tuirenn s. Cait Coiditcenn who was slain in the battle of Mag Tuired, and Tuirenn s. Ogma Grianainech.
One son of Cian s. Dian Cecht, Lug Lamfada: this Cian had another name, Ethlenn s. Dian Cecht, and he had another name, Seal Balb. This is why he is sometimes called Lug s. Ethliu and sometimes Lug s. Seal Balb. Lug Lamhfada had three sons, Ainnle and Abartach and Onu Dereoil.

Danann down to here.

she who had Fe and Menn, the two royal oxen, of whom
is Femen, that is two oxen of Dil of whom is Mag
Femen named. And with them was Tore Triath, king
of the boars of Ireland, of whom is Mag Triathairne
named. With them were heard the three demon cries
in Ireland after ravaging—whistling, and wailing, and outcrjr. And with them was Cirb king of the wethers of
Ireland, of whom is Mag Cirb called. And with them
was German and Cermaid and the Mac Oc,
These are the first who . . . into the mounds of Flidais,
of whom is the cattle of Flidais named : or these were
her four daughters, Arden, Be Chuille, Danann, and
Be Thete.
The Tuatha De Danann first invented [battle] shouting and uproar : for this reason they invented
shouting, for fear of taking ... on the place and plundering, uproar for lamentation at coining in pains. (f) Matha s. Umor, druid of the Tuatha De Danann.

The Tuatha De Danann then, gods were their men of art and non-gods their husbandmen. The three gods of Danu from
whom are named the husband
men, that is the gods, they were the three gods of Danu
from whom they were named, i.e. the three sons of Bres s. Elada, Triall and Brian and Cet, or the three sons of Tuirell
Bicereo, Brian, Iuchair and Iueharba, the three gods of Danu, that is, the three druids from whom were named the Tuatha De Danann.

jesters.

Saith, Leor, Linadh, their three servitors.
Feith, Rosg, Radharc, their three seers.
Tailc, Tren, Tres, their three attendants.
Atach, Gaeth, Sidhi, their three horses.
The Tuatha De Danann then,
gods were the men of art, to
wit De and Danann from whom the Tuath De Danann are
named : non-gods moreover,
from whom are named the husbandmen, i.e., the kings.
The gods of whom are the
kings, these were their namesthe three sons of Bres s. Elada, Triall and Brian and Cet, or three sons of Tuirell Bicreo, Brian, Iuchair and Iueharba, the three gods whom the kings used to worship. Through that it is clear that the kings were not of the Tuatha De Danann but of the husbandmen, that is of the sons of Ethliu. Other scholars say that the Tuatha
De Danann were named from the three druids, Rabb, Brod, and Rob"b.
Their three druids, Fis, Fochmorc, Eolas. Their three instructors, Dub, Dobar, Linad.
And these are their three
servitors, Fet, Rose, Radarc.

two years after he slew Darius : and in the beginning of his advance and
of his kingdom the sons of Mil came to Spain. Five years had Alexander
in the kingship when the sons of Mil came into Ireland, and the Battle of
Tailltiu was fought, in which the Tuatha De Danann fell with their three
kings and their three queens. Five years had Eremon in the kingship when Alexander died in Babylon : so that those are the two hundred years that the Tuatha De Danann were in Ireland, from the last year of the reign or Cambyses son of Cyrus to the completion of the lordship of the
Assyrians and of Darius. One year Cambyses, "Tarpes" 36 years, Xerxes 20 years, Artaxerxes 40 years, Xerxes 2 months, Sogdianus 7 months,
Darius 19 years, "Afferus" 40 years, Artaxerxes Ochus 30, Arrius 4, Darius Magnus 6. Those are the 200 years save 3 years that the Tuatha
De Danann were in Ireland.
376. The Synchronism of the kings of the world with the Tuatha De
Danann here. The Assyrians were in the high kingship of the world from
Ninus s. Belus till the time of the Tuatha De Danann and afterward.
BELOCHUS, the eighteenth king of Assyria, twenty-rive years had he
in the kingship of the world. In the nineteenth year of his reign it is,
that the Tuatha De Danann came into Ireland : and Nuadu Airgetlam was
king over them after the expulsion of Bres.
BELLEPARES thereafter, the nineteenth king of Assyria. Thirty years had he, and in his reign was fought the battle of Mag Tuired
of the Fomoraig, where fell Nuadu Airgetlam and Ogma. Lugh took the
kingship of Ireland. Death of Bres s. Elada in his time.
LAMPRIDES thereafter, the twentieth king of Assyria. Thirty-two
years had he. Death of Cermad son of The Dagda in his time. Death
of Coirpre the poet in his time, and of Etan and of Cian father of Lug.
Death of Allot and Danann in his time.
SOSARES thereafter, the twenty-first king of Assyria. He had twenty
one years. Death of Lug at the hands of Mae Cuill son of Cerma.
Eochaid Ollathair, i.e. The Dagda, took the kingship of Ireland.

ACRISIUS(fc) thereafter, the twenty-second king of Assyria. Thirty
one years had he. In his time died Creidne the wright, Goibniu the smith.
Dian Cecht the leech, and in his time died Aed s. of The Dagda and
Cridinbel the satirist; and Neid was burnt in Ailech Neid.
LAMPARES thereafter, the twenty-third king of Assyria, thirty years
had he. In his day was Picus 'primus rex Latinus. But others [say] that
Saturn was before him over all Europe. Ianus was twenty years before
him on the Tiber. Ianiculum is the name of the man who made a city upon one side of the river at first in his time. ' ' Satusina ' ' was the other city, which was made by Saturn over against it. Death of Manannan by
the hands of Uillend. Death of Midir of Bri Leith. Agamemnon began
to reign.
PANYAS thereafter, the twenty-fourth king- of Assyria, forty-two years had he. Oengus demersus est in mare. The Gaedil journeyed to
Spain, to wit Brath s. Death, whose son was Breogan; Uici, Oici, Mantan and Caicher. Death of The Dagda. Delbaeth took the kingship of Ireland, Hercules and Iason came into the land of the Colchians in quest of the golden fleece in the time of Panyas. Death of Delbaeth thereafter, and Fiacha son of Delbaeth took the kingship.
SOSARMUS thereafter, the twenty-fifth king of Assyria. Twenty-nine years had he. Death of Fiachna s. Delbaeth in his time. The progeny of
Cermat took the kingship in his time. The capture of Troy by Laomedon at that time.
MITREUS thereafter, the twenty-sixth king of Assyria. Twenty-eight
years had he in the princedom. Ith s. Breogan came to Ireland in the days of the sons of Cermat, and the sons of Cermat worked treachery upon
him, as he was returning : and that is the cause of the [coming-] of the Sons of Mil to Ireland, to take vengeance for Ith upon the Tuatha
De Danann. Thus it was the sons of Mil who gave the battle of
Tailltiu to the Tuatha De Danann, so that the three kings of Ireland,
Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, Mac Greine fell there; in vengeance for Ith was that battle waged.
377. That is the Taking of the Tuatha De Danann with their
synchronism from beginning to end, omitting the deaths of the female children of Cermat after them. This is for a reckoning' of the length of
the princedom of the Tuatha De Danann—seven years of the princedom of Belochus, and thirty years of Bellepares, thirty-two years to Lamprides, twenty-one to Sosares, thirty-one to Acrisius, Lampares thirty years,
Panyas forty-two years, Sosarmus twenty years, and eight years to Mitreus.
In his reign the sons of Mil came to Ireland to revenge Ith s. Breogan,
and offered the battle of Sliab Mis and the battle of Tailltiu and every
other battle, till the Tuatha De Danann were subdued by the sons of Mil thereafter.

1. The Tuatha De Danann under obscurity, a people without a covenant of religion; whelps of the wood that has not withered, people of the blood of Adam's flesh.
2. Nobles yonder of the strong people, people of the withered summit, let us relate, in the course in which we are, their periods in their kingdom.
3. A space of seven years of Nuadu noble-stately over the fair-haired company,
the rule of the man large-breasted, flaxen-maned, before his coming into Ireland.
4. In Mag Tuired, heavy with doom, where fell a champion of the battle,
from the white defender of the world
his arm of princedom was lopped off.

fl 356. According to K the children of Bethach settled "in the northern islands of Greece," wherever these may be. Kg establishes them "in
Boeotia in the north of Europe," a place which O'Mahony
(as quoted by Dinneen i 203) endeavours to identify with Bothnia, though Kg himself accepts the testimony of Pomponius Mela to the effect that the place was in Achaia. The point of all these geographical contradictions lies in the word "northern." The sunless north, out of which come the cold blasts of boreal winds, is credited with a nature demonic and uncanny; a number of references bearing on this belief
may be found in W. Johnson, Byways of British Archccology, chap. viii. Such a region would obviously be the fitting
resort for those who wished to acquire what R2 calls "the devil's druidry." This ]\ must come from a different hand from that of the author of fl 353, where the magical arts of
the TDD are warmly commended.

The fetish test of legitimacy and fitness for kingship—an important consideration when the king was a god upon earth ; the inexhaustible cauldron ; the invincible weapons : such
conveniences, along with the shoes of swiftness, the cloak of invisibility, the omnipotent but subservient slave of the lamp, are short cuts in the struggle for existence or for domination which from the beginning of time have obsessed the dreams of mankind all the world over. Doubtless some folktale, introducing this complex of magical apparatus, and assumed to be a genuine tradition of past events, provided the history

mongers with the materials which they worked up into their
narrative. We may presume that the names of the cities were constructed in their laboratories, but the mental processes which evolved them are hard to follow: "Failias" is apparently from fat, "hedge," with a backward glance at
the name of Lia Fail, whatever that may signify; "Goirias"
from ffor, "fire" ;
" Finnias ' ' from finn,
' ' white "
;
" Muirias ' '
from muir, "sea"—these etymologies lie on the surface, but they do not reveal the essential meaning of the names, if any. In "fire" and "sea" (= water) we might see a reference to two of the four elements of ancient philosophical speculation, but the connexion which we should have to trace between the other two names and "earth" and "air" could only be longe petitum. If the names are not mere conscious
arbitrary inventions, we must leave the problem of their origin unsettled. The -ias termination may have been borrowed from names like Ercias or Dovinias, which the inventors had deciphered in an Ogham inscription. As for the names of the sages, they have at least a superficial appearance of having been adapted from biblical sources :
Moirfesa = [Liber] Sapientis, Esrus = Esdras, Usicias =
Ezechias, Semias = [Ne]hemias. The influence of the Old Testament in shaping Irish pseudo-legends must be frankly acknowledged. D'Arbois de Jubainville long ago pointed out that much of the legendary biography of St. Patrick is
a mere adaptation of the history of Moses (R.C. ix, p. Ill ff.).
Kg gives these names in a different form—Arias ( = Usicias),
Eurus (= Esrus), Morias (== Moirfesa). Rightly or wrongly, Lia Fail, the centre of much folklore real and spurious, is identified with a pillar-stone still standing upon Tara Hill : see
my Tara, a Pagan Sanctuary of Ancient Ireland, p. 134 ff. The penological nature of the Scone stone in the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey does not encourage us to seek
it there.

doubtless the original story—a company of supernatural beings descending from the sky in a cloud of darkness.

The F*Q text is virtually the same as L, but is much
inflated with interpolations. The first of these (i ni fes

bunadas, etc.) is here quite superfluous; it seems to come from some text which had not already specified Bethach as
the ancestor. The second is glossarial, attempting to specify the mountain upon which the invaders alighted, and identifying (erroneously) "Conmaicne Rein" with Conmaiane Guile in southern Mayo. The third, beginning atbert imorro, tells an alternative story of their arrival, in a naval expedition, and of their burning of their ships. This version
appears in R2
, which knows nothing of the aerial flight ; but the two presentations of the story, being made in different
words, must come from different sources. Thus R 2 tells us that Sliab an Iarainn, a mountain in Co. Leitrim which still bears the same name, was the goal of the sea-expedition :
this is not mentioned in RXR3
, and in any case it is nowhere stated that this mountain enters into the story of a descent
from the air. Most likely this interpolation is capable of further analysis, the discussion of the reason why the ships
w
rere burnt representing the lucubrations of one or more
successive scribes or readers. In the R2 family some MSS. have borrowed the R^It3 form, and reproduced it in fl 321, 327.
I have found no history attaching to the name Sliab mac n-Delgada. For the burning of the ships compare the action of the women of the followers of Aeneas (Aeneid v 604 ff.), who by a similar device endeavour to compel their leader to remain in Sicily, and so to save themselves from further
toilsome wandering.

The intrusive sentences in L (Tuath Dea . . . deogbaire) contain and expand a saying regarding the TDD, frequently
repeated, that "their men of art were gods, their husbandmen were non-gods." The only possible meaning of this
sentence is an admission of the divine nature of the TDD. They were in fact the gods of the "Milesian" conquerors. Gods are of two classes, corresponding roughly to the di consentes, the state gods invoked by persons and on occasions of importance : and the numina, presiding over the

the cults of its serfs, might very well brush aside contemptuously as "non-gods." There are not a few traces of odium theologicwm between ruler and serf to be detected
between the lines of Irish literature. The TDD are in this
passage called by an unusual form of their name—Tuaih
Dm—which is corroborative of an extraneous origin for this passage. The enumeration of four classes of persons who
used special incantations is suggestive, and probably based on fact.

of the stone's properties by Conn of the Hundred Battleswho lived, if he lived at all, at a date considerably later than
Cu Chulaind—prophesies in very obscure language that it was destined to remain in Tailltiu, not in Temair, for ever. Presumably there was a stone called "Fal's Heart" at the
sanctuary of Tailltiu—an erratic boulder perhaps, not
necessarily a pillar-stone—which became the centre of analogous legends. This seems to indicate some sort of connexion between Temair and Tailltiu, but that is all that can be said about it. Practically nothing remains, above ground
at least, at Tailltiu, and there is certainly no stone there now which could reasonably be identified with "Fal's Heart." The tale of Cu Chulaind 's action is obviously a mere serological myth, to account for the alleged transference of the stone from the one place to the other.

the quasi-tabular form of the original list, but these remain in all the other versions. See the introduction to this section for all matters of importance relating to this and the following paragraphs. Eidleo is not to be found in the older genealogies at all, but he appears in the interpolation in ]\ 368 (p. 188) ; immediately afterwards, in the same document, he (or less probably another of the same name) is
son of Net and great-grandfather of En mac Bic-eoin. Possibly he is another manifestation of Lug's protean mother
Eithliu. A change of punctuation will be observed on comparing the two parallel texts, necessitated by the interpolated ( ?) dana between de rochair and Ernmass in Min.
Ernmas in ft 316, mother of Fotla, Banba, and Eriu—mother
also of Badb, Macha and Anand in ft 314—was, according
to the former paragraph, daughter of Etarlam, for whose name the otherwise unrecorded Etargal of our present paragraph appears to be a mere scribal error. Echtach was son of Etarlam according to the pedigree of Nuadu, and was the father of Nuadu himself. No Fiachra or Fiachna appears
in the genealogies other than the king, whom we find near
the end of the TDD dynasty. Obviously this is inconsistent with the story of his death in the battle of Mag Tuired.
The addition of Tuirill Piccreo ( = Delbaeth s. Ogma) to the
list of casualties is peculiar to Min. The unpleasant story
of the poisoning of Bres with bog-water (ante, p. 99) is referred to by K, but ignored by the other texts. In the
interpolation which F adds to the end of this paragraph in
the R 1 text, the formula alt fri halt i feiih fri feith has all the appearance of being a fragment of some old healing spell1 (I find since writing this note that "Whitley Stokes has

the Lugnasad festival. Its artificial nature is sufficiently
indicated by the absurd name "3Iag Mor ('big plain') King of Spain." O'Davoren's glossary explains nasad by
gnathugad, and in another glossary quoted by Windiseh s.v. the word is explained by chl. The allusion at the end of
the Min text of this fl to "Oengus" refers to Feilire Oengusso, 26 Oct., where we read Nassad, Beoan, Mellan, nach mod ata-snlaim (H. Bradshaw Soc. edn., p. 218). There are
glosses on this passage (for which see idem, pp. 226, 228) explaining these as three saints, from Britain, in Tamlachta near Loch Bricrenn (Loch Brickland, Co. Down) : in these glosses an alternative reading Nassau is adopted for the first of these names. In Gorman's Martyrology only Beoan and
Mellan are mentioned, and Marcian, who has apparently no direct connexion with them, takes the place of Nassad or Nassan. These names are associated again in the Feilire
of Oengus (Bradshaw edn., p. 96) : a gloss there printed makes "Beoan son of Mellan son of Nessan" father of Mo-Choemoc. There is no extant copy of the Oengus text containing the expression "Nassad Logha" attributed to it in Min. As there
are variant readings Beoain, Mellain, recorded, it seems possible that Stokes, in editing the text, was misled by these glosses into taking Nassad or Nassan as a proper name, and that we should read Nassad Beoain Mellain, "the festival (?)
of Beoan and Mellan." Accepting the interpretation
gnathugad, we may render the word nassad as " assembly," "resort," or the like. The word aurdach, used as an apparent synonym, is obscure. That it was in honour of some personage, divine or human, will perhaps explain the rendering clu. The paragraph is inserted here in anticipation of the account of Lug, to be given presently. The notably frequent minor verbal differences between the parallel texts
in fl 311, while maintaining a uniformity of sense, raise the question whether the two versions are not independent translations of a Latin original or independent paraphrases of a versified record.

circumstances are not emphasized in the text before us. The grotesque story of the battle, edited by Stokes (Rev. Celtique xii, p. 52), appears to be a mere farce, designed to bring ridicule upon the ancient gods, and, though using some traditional material, is hardly of as much value for the history of cult as has been supposed. 2 In fact, all such stories of sanguinary slaughter are to a large extent matters
of religious polemic—the gods being represented as mere men, living the lives and dying the deaths of men. Maeha,
one of the Badb sisterhood, has a certain individuality of her own, and enjoyed a special cult, probably centred at Armagh
(Ard Macha), to which she has bequeathed her name. Her intrusion into the Badb sisterhood may be a subsequent
development, for the genealogies before us seem to suggest an earlier tradition in which Badb and the variously-named
third member of the group formed a dyad. We are not enlightened as to the place of Bruidne and Casmael in the
genealogical stemma, but in ff 314 they appear along with Criehinbel as "satirists," a role attributed to them here also
in the F text. De Domnann ' ' god of depth ( 1)

The leech Dian Cecht, son of Esairc or Erairc son of Net son of Indui, was second cousin of Echtach s. Elada s. Ordan s. Indui, father of Nuadu ; so that Dian Cecht 's sons Cu, Cethen, Cian, are conceived of as second cousins of Nuadu himself. Miach holds a rather precarious place among the sons of Dian Cecht : frequently only the other three are mentioned. Their alliterative names suggest dioscuric
analogies ; moreover Cu and Cethen pair off by themselvesthere were two pillarstones at Temair which bore their

ff 366. An incoherent collection
of genealogical snippets, about which there is little that need here be said beyond what is contained in the introduction. The reference letters (inserted in the later redactions after the numbers of the paragraphs) will enable them to be traced for purposes of comparison from redaction to redaction. As for the geographical names contained in this paragraph, Ailech Neit is identified with the great hill-top fort called Grianan Ailigh, near Deny; Mag Treifherne and Mag Cirba, do not appear to have been identified (neither of them is mentioned in Dindsenchas, and they may be quite
mythical) ; Da Chich, Anann, the Paps mountains, south of Killarney; Coemdruim as a name for Uisneeh (west of Mullingar) appears in Dindsenchas in the form Cclindruim. (MD iv 273) which suggests a confusion with Druim Cain, a by-name of Temair (ib. i, 40).
The four entries f - i undoubtedly refer to sacred cattle and the places where they were kept, but they are so condensed as to be quite unintelligible. Tore triath in (h) cannot be dissociated from the Twrc trwydd of Welsh
romance. On Mag Fea (g) see the note to j[ 201 in section IV,
told. The passage in Dindsenclms, there quoted, is more in accordance with the paragraph before us, though not identical with it. Mag Femin is identified with the plain between Cashel and Clonmel. Flidais and her cattle naturally suggest reference to the story called Tain Bo Flidais''' : but that tale has totally different associations, and has no light to throw on the passage before us.

connexion with the sirens who sought to enchant the "Milesian" voyagers.
11 316. A further genealogical catalogue, differing, however, in essence from that contained in fl 314. The former
paragraph is departmental rather than genealogical, giving the functions of the various persons enumerated ; and tracing
genealogical connexions downward, in the formula "A had
so many sons, B, C . . ." The present paragraph is purely genealogical; and (with but one or two exceptions, which probably belong to the document from which fl 314 comes) it traces genealogical connexions upward, in the formula
"Z son of Y, son of X," etc. The additional particulars given about Lug and Oirbsen have all the appearance of being intrusive. The name "Manannan mac Lir," though
found in Poem no. LVII, does not occur anywhere in the prose texts of LG. Sliab na tri nDee, if it had any objective existence at all, was doubtless a sacred mountain, haunted
by a group of deities (compare Sliab na mBan ffinri), but it remains unidentified. The sublimated divinity of the
gods-of-gods, Brian, Iucharba, Iuchair, however it may be
underlined by their dioscuric nomenclature and by their
closely knit parentage (their mother being their father's daughter), is inconsistent with everything recorded of them in OidJieadh Cloinne Tuireann, our chief source of information about them. This story, like the Mag Tuired tale referred
to above, is essentially an anti-pagan "droll," based on folklore elements, but artificially concocted. The Sid of Bodb
has been identified with Sliab na mBan ffinn (Slievenaman) near Clonmel : see Hogan's Onomasticon, s.w. Sid Buidb, Sid Femen. The colophon at the end of the paragraph clearly indicates the end of the original document.
1[ 316a is a summary of the foregoing genealogy, boiled
down by the redactor who tacked Min on to the R2 text, and who cut down what, by that process, became redundancies. This is shown by the opening words : quia plene ante

in R 2

auxiliary appendix to R2

Tj 317, an addition (so far as R 1 is concerned) peculiar to F, gives us the particulars about the sacred cattle, already
in fl 314, but there in L only : and repeats the note about Lug, already given in fl 316. It ends with a series of artificial triads of nonsense names, empty of historical significance, and only faintly deserving of serious consideration. They look more like devices to amuse rather backward children than anything else ! Some of the names have an obvious elementary meaning, but the rest, to me at least, are unintelligible. The list suggests comparison with the trains of helping attendants, whose hypertrophied gifts of sight, hearing, marksmanship, and what not, so often come to the aid of heroes of folk-romances : and herein lies the real interest which it possesses. It shows us our historians dismounting from their scholastic Pegasus, such as it was,
and condescending to borrow directly from the popular oral
literature of the folk. No doubt there is a folklore basis throughout LG, as throughout the whole of the Romantic elements in Celtic literature : but it has been transformed and, if we may so express it, Maephersonised by successive generations of literary redactors to such an extent, that the appearance of what sounds like something that might come more or less directly from the lips of a rustic story-teller
gives us a slight shock of surprise. fl 318. This paragraph is badly mutilated and corrupted
in F : to understand it reference must be made to the version in *Q (R 3
If 371) which is more complete and in better order. I confess that o lodin as firu "caught me out" : I need not record my efforts to extract sense from it, for Professor
Bergin kindly gave me the correct interpretation. It is a corruption of olsodain as firu "which is truer." It is
consoling to observe that, to judge from the variae lectiones, the native scribes and scholars were equally bewildered! If 319. This is the story which appears later in the tale called Oidheadh Cloinne Tuireann (here abbreviated OCT):
it adds a number of details to the list of "erics" there found, and, though irrelevant to the narrative of LG, it is of some value in cult-history. The text before us, with the appended poem, has already been edited, with chief reliance on the

Tlmrneysen (ZCP, xii, 239). Both in order and in details the
two lists of the erics vary : the following are the differences :
1. Horses of King of Sicily. This is no. 4 in the OCT list; their names are not given, but the king is called Dobar (borrowed from the tale of the sojourn
of the TDD in Alba).
2. Spear of Asal. In OCT, where it is no. 3, ascribed
to Pisear, King of Persia (an adaptation of the Fisher-king in the Grail legend).4 The words of power which caused the spear to advance and retreat are lost from OCT, though they are echoed in the name Areadbhair, which the spear of Pisear is said to bear. Like the triads already commented upon, this looks like a fragment of popular rather than of artificial history : but it is difficult to resist the temptation to toy with the idea that the
peculiar properties of the spear conceal a faraway reminiscence of the boomerang; which, although now confined to Australia, was certainly at one time a weapon used in Europe, and might have survived in backward regions to a comparatively later date.
3. Pig-skin of Bids—of Tuis in OCT, where it is no. 2.
4. Six pigs of Essach—seven pigs in OCT, where they belong to "Esal king of the Golden Columns."
Their capacity for enduring alternate butchery and resurrection relates them to Scehrimnir, the boar of Valhalla, which presented the same economical convenience. 411
5. Whelp of the royal smith of Ioruath—the whelp of
the King of Hiruath in OCT, where it is no. 6, and
4 There are other Grail analogies in the OCT version. The spear of Pisear stood in a vessel of water to prevent it from burning the house : as the bleeding lance in the palace of Le BicJie Pecheoir stood in the
Holy Grail. See Bealoideas, i, p. 13, where the subject is worked out in detail. *a Grijlfaginning, in Die Prosaische Edda, ed. Wilken, p. 48.

is called Fdil-inis—which sounds like an extra
ordinary mythological mix-up, but is at least as old as the eleventh century : see Thurneysen, op. cit., p. 243. There are no such properties attributed to
it in OCT as are stated here.
6. The revelation of the submerged island called Caire
Cendfinne—In OCT this, no. 7 in the list, has become the cooking spit of the submerged Inis Finchoire.
7. The apples under-wave in the neighbourhood of the same island have, under classical influence,
become the golden apples of the Hesperides in OCT. The present version does not know of the "Three shouts of the Hill of Midchain," which
makes an eighth eric in the OCT list, and through which the brethren meet their death. Nor has the
sister Ethne, with whom OCT provides the brethren, any place in the genealogies before us.
Commach, a word in the fourth of the list of erics, is
doubtless = comagh, explained in O'Clery's Glossary as = "brisead." The story of the sickness of Tuirill and of the drastic
emetic draught by which he was cured, is an independent narrative, told to explain the names and probably also the origins of certain lakes. Loimm, which here evidently means matter ejected, is more commonly used of a draught assimilated. Cnoc Uachtair Archae is another name for the Hill of Uisnech5
: the lakes mentioned are all in the Westmeath area (now Loch Owel, Loch Iron, Loch Ennell). Andind is an adjective applied to Pharaoh by Joseph in
Saltair ;na Rann (line 3334), but no one seems to know what it means. Evidently it was a matter of indifference to the person who added this paragraph to the text, that the com
pilers of LG had already explained the name of the lake in a way altogether different (see vol. iii, p. 120).

fl 321. An artificial composition, mixed out of a modicum of learning and a modicum of folklore : that it is a genuine folk-tale in the form in which it is presented to us could hardly be maintained. Obviously it is a crude interpola
tion : it leaves the TDD in Ireland, whither they have flown by air ; in the following ft 322 they have not yet arrived there. Learning has contributed a recollection of the Old Testament Philistines; folklore has contributed such details as the magical property of hazel and quicken wood, the use of pins (compare the "pin of slumber," so frequent in folk-tales), and the idea of resuscitation by means of "demons"
(i.e., projected souls). The fluctuation of spelling (eirrscibairrscib) is carried through the MSS. It is most likely that the words tria druidhecht -\ coinflechta are an old glossarial
interpolation : they are needless, and they break very awkwardly in between the verb and its object. In fact,
1 coinflechta is probably a still later addition, as it does not really make a good "pair" with druidhecht. What the original author meant to say was no doubt "they made demons of themselves" [and so could fly in the air] : these
interpolations have first obscured and then destroyed the sense intended.
ft 322. This version apparently does not know of the sojourn in the "northern islands of the world," or of the
four magical cities : it represents the TDD as acquiring their training in magic in Greece. There is nothing here about the talc of the Athenians and the Philistines. In fact, these
three paragraphs (320-322) record incompatible traditions : they must come ultimately from as many different sources : and they show the extraordinary complexity of contradictory traditions and (as it must be recognized quite candidly) artificial "fakes," which the synthetic historians have handed down to us. On "Dobur and Urdobur," see the note to ft 243 in the preceding volume. It will be noticed that this version of the

appears to mean "a god's hedge"—feth is explained as meaning "hedge" in O'Davoren's Glossary. It is the spell (or perhaps the instrument, corresponding to the tarnkappe of Teutonic mythology) whereby such beings made themselves invisible. 6 The note, therefore, is to the effect that these
persons, being about to plunder a burial-mound, suborned certain druids to render them invisible by such magical
means and, therefore, inaccessible to the supernatural beings, spirits of the dead or what not, who might otherwise give
practical expression to their resentment. We may compare the airbe druad, the "druids' fence," an invisible screen
which protected certain privileged persons against wounding in battle. The impotence of such protectors on Samain is
suggestive, as well as the necessity of magical protection for one who engages in such sacrilegious but profitable enterprises. (From Acallamh na Senorach, ed. Stokes, p. 31, we gather that when St. Patrick took part in them, he was well able to look after himself.) The tomb-robbing attributed to

ff 322 : the different lengths of time spent there, seven (R 2

This makes several incongruities, as when Ceol, Bind, and Teitbind become the names of three hounds rather than of three harpers, and involves a rather "cheap" extemporisation of names for the three forts at the end of the list.

inadvertently prefixed Acenceres and Achoris, confusing the first of these with Cenchres, the successor of Achoris, and

the Hebrew form of his name. 10 Artaxerxes Ochus reigned 24, not 30 years. ' ' Mardochius ' ' isillegitimately associated with him by reason of the association of the Biblical Esther with his predecessor.

the contemporary of Moses. He has also overlooked the fact that for 178 years, beginning with the year 836 of Eusebius 's Era of Abraham, while Eusebius recognises the existence of the Egyptian monarchy, he gives no names of any of the kings. The alleged interval between these kings is absurd. Aeenceres began to reign (according to the Eusebian chronology) A.A. 369 ; Cenchres A. A. 388 : and Nectanebus reigned 1650-1667. In either case the calculation is out by about 400 years.
ff 375. The four followers of Alexander the C4reat named in this paragraph were Ptolemaeus (Lagi filius) reigned in Egypt 40 years; Philippus Aridaeus in Macedonia; Antigonus in Asia ; Seleucus Nicanor in Syria. The process of blundering which has given to the last the improbable prefix Brutus would be hard to reconstruct—possibly some muddled speculation mixing up Aeneas Silvius of Latium, Aeneas of Troy, and the Trojan Brutus who came to Britain, teste Geoffrey of Monmouth, to become the eponym of the British
people.
II (M).
fl 376. There is no use in endeavouring to reconcile this
chronology with that of the first synchronism. There is a
discrepancy of 913 years between them : they represent the
calculations of different schools of theorists. Belochus, 11 whom
this system makes contemporary with the beginning of the
TDD occupation, began to reign A.A. 583 ; Darius, the head of the other synchronism, succeeded to the throne of Persia A.A. 1496.
Belochus is, in fact, the eighteenth "King of Assyria'' in the Eusebian list, and there, as in the document before
us, he is said to have reigned 25 years. Accepting without criticism the further data supplied by Eusebius, we find that
Bellepares (30 years) and Lamprides (32 years) succeeded him. Sosares followed for 20 (not 21) years. But Acrisius was not an Assyrian king : he began to reign over Argos in the fifth
11 Sic Migne : Bolochun Scaliger.



NOTES ON SECTION VII. 313
year of Sosares, and reigned there for the 31 years which our chronicler assigns to him in Assyria. Lampares followed
Sosares for 38 years: Panyas (45 years—not 42 12
) followed;
then Sosarmus (19 years—not 29) ; and Mitreus (27 years—not 28). It is not difficult to see how "Sosarmus" could, by a succession of careless copyings of an unfamiliar word, become
"Sopandus" —the s (y) becoming p and the r (-p) becoming n.
Mitreus = Metarailius is not so self-evident, but it may have arisen out of a hazy recollection of the two names Arius and Arailius, which came together earlier in the Eusebian list of Assyrian monarchs. The Latin synchronisms with Lampares, set forth in this paragraph, are suggested by a note in Eusebius. Under A.A. 839 he notes Primus rex Latinorum post captain Troiam Aeneas: ante ewn Ictnus, Satumus, Picus, Faunus regnauerunt
annis circiter 150 13—which brings us back to A.A. 689.
Lampares, according to the same authority, began to reign A.A. 690, so that he is practically contemporary with the mythical dynasty in question.
" Satusina ' '
is obviously a miswriting of Saturnia, but the chronicler has sadly misunderstood the legendary fragments that have come to his knowledge : the Ianiculum has for him become a man, and as for the "opposition" city,
he is evidently thinking of the altar of Saturn alleged by some doubtful authorities to have been established on the Capitoline Hill. Agamemnon is brought in much too soon : according to Eusebius, he began to reign in the 11th year of Tautanes, who followed Mitreus, the last king in the present list. On the other hand, the voyage of the Argonauts :s actually dated to the 27th year of Panyas, and Hercules' ravaging of Troy to the 4th year of Sosarmus. The drowning of Oengus in the sea does not appear elsewhere in the LCI canon.

Metre : Debide scdilte.
The language of this poem presents few difficulties, and requires but little annotation : it is a mere list of names and
of fates, set forth as succinctly and as straightforwardly as the laws of the metre permit. It is quite as clear to the present editor as it could be to any reader that the poem should not be left without following up all the quasi-historical references which it contains : but such a task would amount to the preparation of a monograph upon Irish legend which, to be at all useful, would far exceed any space that could possibly be allotted to it here. It is with no desire to shirk a necessarily laborious task that this obviously essential side of the study of the poem is here passed over : rather is it to leave the way open for a future scholar, who shall give us an independent and exhaustive investigation of its mythological content, in all its bearings and ramifications.

by guesswork, at best forced and not very intelligible) there is little in the language to call for comment. K's glosses are not illuminating. The chief interest of the poem is the inclusion of Manannan, who is "out of the picture" in the triad with which he is associated : the tradition which it enshrines seems to be rather different from that followed by the compilers, who have adapted it to their purposes.

in the TDD company, of which, although it is "officially" ignored in the prose texts, it is here and there possible to
detect traces. Undoubtedly the TDD adventure was originally
much more picturesque than the comparatively decorous narrative handed down to us would allow us to suspect ! 2101. The appended de is merely an otiose use of the

(= no, "or"), which in most of the extant MSS. has become a second .1. following the last numerical item, .uii.l., "seven
fifties." In A this has become .i., "that is." The following numerals are variously stated, and must have suffered
modification at the hands of copyists—a frequent fate of numbers, especially when expressed in Roman notation. Putting these all together and comparing them, the most
probable reconstruction would appear to be ixc cxx clx—the items of which have become dismembered, and regrouped in the form ix.c.c.xx.c.lx, in which the second .c. has dropped
out. This gives us nine hundred + 120 + 160 = 1180, which is just seventeen short of the first estimate. The ninety
that fell in Ogma's company are apparently a separate
reckoning, not counted into either total. This is the nearest that we can get to a solution of the puzzle.
LXV.
Metre : Rannaigecht recomarcach (rhyming, as a rule, abcb, though with some irregularity). This long poem appears in the place where it is here
printed in F and R:!
. It was omitted in L, and there is a
marginal note, animadverting upon the omission, in the place corresponding to its position in F. Most likely the scribe
of I j left it out because of its tedious length. In R 2 it occupies a different place ; it is there found in the Roll of the Kings which ends the compilation, after the paragraphs relating to Oengus Olmucach.



NOTES ON SECTION VII. 323
At first sight this would appear to be a more logical place for the poem, which is a recapitulatory summary of the history, beginning from the Cessair invasion, and ending with the monarch named. It is indeed such an obviously suitable place for it that, on the ordinaiy critical canon praeferatur lectio difficilior, suspicion arises as to whether it is correct.
A pointer is given by the Book of Fermoy, in which the poem is distinguished by an elaborately decorative initial
letter. This was probably traditional in the R1 tradition : we have seen other cases of tradition in decoration, in the
lay-out of the literary matter, and so forth, passing from text to text : and it suggests that the poem was not a mere
appendage to the matter immediately preceding (as is the case of most of the interpolated verses) but was, in a sense, an integral part of the compilation. And once this aspect of the case presents itself, the explanation of the poem, and of its position in the text, follows immediately. The poem comes at the end of the interpolated section, which (as we have already shown) was originally an independent compilation, here called Liber Praecursorum. It would serve admirably as an appendix to Liber Praecursorum, acting as a mnemonic digest of the contents of that book, and giving enough of the subsequent events to show the place of those contents in the whole artificiallyconstructed history of Ireland. It is thus a connecting link between the Precursors and the Milesian occupation :
and its addition to LP was the first step towards making
that history complete. The subsequent incorporation of
LP with the Milesian Liber Occupationis made this
appendix superfluous ; but except in the Book of Leinster the scribes continued to copy it mechanically. It must have
been in *Q, in the same place as in F, and accordingly it
appears in the same place in the R3 text. According to the Annals of Ulster, the author of the poem, Eochaid ua Floinn, died in the year 1003 at the age of 69. Say that he wrote this poem about the middle of his life, this would give circa 968 as the date of its composition, and a major limit for the date at which Liber Praecursorum became compounded with Liber Occupationis.
The compiler of R2
, or one of his copyists, must have come



324 NOTES ON SECTION VII.
across the poem in a MS. of R1
: but he must have regarded it as being out of place, for the reasons mentioned above, and consequently he inserted it where we find it, in the
Roll of the Kings. K, which, as we have seen, is based on R2
,
gives us a heavily glossed copy, in the same place.

quatrain is obscure, owing to the uncertainty attaching to the meaning of mideing (see R.I.A. Contributions s.v. mid(s)cng) and the ambiguity of the sense of faemdait. Fosair pre
sumably = fasair "litter," "a bed of straw." On the strength of the gloss I interpret mol as "collection" (= mid), but it seems to strain the sense of the word to apply it to a company of persons. (4) Glosses : 2201. ger cian a hiomramh no gidh fada do

S'jme hesitation. R 2

desire to soften the many asperities of this particular poet,
has changed the word to the easier ro himbred. "The sea of Letha" may be the sea of Latium or of Armorica, at the
reader's pleasure. (5) Glosses: 2206. Ro ba tualaing -\ ro ba cumacJitach e

translation is probably even less comprehensible : the "separation" (of the Partholonians from Ireland) gave a "right" to the Nemedians to take the country. In the second couplet, the author has evidently sacrificed everything for the jingling chiasmus of consonants crossed by a direct
consonance of vowels—soithig : soigid—moigid : noithig.
Once more R 2 simplifies the last line, and, as the third of the

above quoted glosses shows, K as usual follows that text. I moigid should be, I suppose, i mmoidid. (8) Glosses : 2217. nuall cech baile A. rob oirrderc i ngach ionad. 2218. ba sluagh laidir iat ar cech comair, no baoi

rather than "blade," an equally possible rendering, in deference to the associated gloss, without necessarily adopting
its eschatologieal interpretation. The chief interest of the
quatrain is its practical identification of the TDD invasion with that of the Fir Bolg.
(10) Glosses : 2225-6. Ro ghabhsat Gaoidil glan-mora baoi for scaoilti for iomluadail as gach feronn inaroile (reading nosgabsat Gaeidil). 2227-8. Nir lag an fine dia rabhatar na fir sin, no as fir na b'enert aineolach an fini iet-san (reading
fa daill faeindil). Here again we confront difficulties. Fa darill makes a bad assonance with glanuill, but though some of the MSS. write fadaill in one wTord, this does not appear to have any meaning. The plural form fanda, though syntactically open to criticism, seems to be dictated by the assonance with clanda in the following line.

Tascor is presumably the right reading : tascur seems to be a blunder induced by the word trascur.

"according to time-lengths,'' but it is at best a mere meaning
less eheville. Tomch I take as an adjectival form from tor,
"troop, company." Aimsir dllgid domain, literally "time of law of the world," a phrase with which I have done the best that I can.

ccenntar (sic) .i. hi fus in Eirinn. F's strange misreading, Darcilus for Dauid, must be the end of a series of progressive
corruptions—starting from TD^tn-o, the n having become dismembered and partly fused with the preceding <n,
ultimately producing <\]\c while -o by similar gradual steps
became I3. We must postulate at least three links between
F and the last of its ancestors which had the name correctly. Doubtless the error has been assisted by the Eusebian tables, which give us Dercilus as the name of an Assyrian king who reigned from the thirteenth year of Saul to the thirty-seventh
year of David. Another misreading appears in M in the next line, where the scribe read reimsech as rennsech and
rensech. The alternative reading to rosfeid in R2
, followed by K, would mean "in his great land."

328 NOTES ON SECTION VII.
the difficulty which the annotators found in it. The reading
for Mumain in M has arisen from a misreading of p for f, the usual abbreviation for acht, with a consequential change of the following word. That Miima, not Mumain, is correct is shown by hura> in the next line. Imeal is one of the meanings given in O'Clery's glossary for ur. The translation of the last couplet of this quatrain is merely a matter of deciding between equally uncertain alternatives.

sileadh inbir moir la taobh na rorinne ruaidhc forsata, no gurap budh deas do raoirinn ruaidh ata. This quatrain offers
several alternative readings, without much reason to prefer one to another. The "causeway of the flood-tower" does not
appear to be a geographical name, and K guesses wildly to
interpret the expression. In line 2290 the reading of M is here followed, which is certainly the lectio difficilior. The other MSS. give us, with various spellings, ni bern-bothair acht buaball "no gap of a road but a trumpet" : the last word being further changed to buadall meaning, apparently "a victory-hall." In the following line, taibsib has probably
been introduced into the text of M by the influence of the
same word just above (line 2286). We may perhaps preferably read here with the other MSS. co tibrib, "with the wellsprings south of the road of Rairiu" (the name of two places, one in Hi Failge, the other in the neighbourhood of Athy
in Co. Kildare). Inber Mor in Cualu is the estuary of the Ovoca river at Arklow.

Can-air Blaraidhe is apparently in Murloch Bay, Co. Antrim, just south of Fair Head : of the rhyming cheville in line 2294 K's interpretation that it means that "the sea was a veil to
it" is as good as any. Probably "The nine Riges of Rosmag" and "the nine Brosnas of Eile" are at best mere folklore.

reasonable sense to line 2299 is hopeless : K understands it to mean that the rivers were fettered as hostages, until they had an opportunity of bursting their barriers and acting in
the ordinary way of rivers. He has a reading not found in any of the older MSS. fo soi sretha "which ranks turned" for fo recht reatha.

be the reading contemplated by the older extant MSS. ; but
K glosses it as though it were Loch Laigh Unni "we have Loch
Laigh.
' This makes no difference : both names denote Belfast Loch. The reading of M, nir Hand, is meaningless (note the childish spellings in this MS. in the present quatrain,
Uaad, ciaach, reaach, Riaach) : F 's ba baud is not much better.
K-, followed by K, has las mBaath "with which is Baath," i.e., Loch Baadh (Loch Bagh, Co. Roscommon), which, like Loch Laigh, is alleged to have burst forth in the time of
Eremon. Loch Cimme = Loch Hacket : Loch Da Chaech = Waterford Harbour : K's gloss refers to his reading, ceim gan creach:, explained as "a step without a wave" whatever
that may mean. Loch Rein is in Co. Leitrim near Fenagh :
tEe alternative reading, L. Lein, would mean the Killarney lakes. The adjective reach is analysed into ro-eo-ach "very

Galway.

Metre : debide scdilte. This poem, which has only a factitious association with LG, is included for the sake of
completeness. It has been edited (from the A text) by



340 NOTES ON SECTION VII.
Professor Thurneysen, ZCP, xii, p. 245, with a German translation. It runs closely parallel to the prose text, which
is evidently founded upon it.
(5) The story of the discovery of the culprits differs totally from that in OCT. Thurneysen emends imbrig (in both MSS.) to mi-brig.
(7) 2522. Etromm means "light (to understand), clear."
(9) 2531. Regda guis is translated by Thurneysen, with a
mark of doubt, welche Stiirmischkeit erlangen werden. The "deaths of Ernmas" are presumably explained by the prose paraphrase, nismittet gona na tonna no tinnte, "woundings or waves or fires harm them not."
(10) This stanza is very corrupt. It is here given as in the MSS. Thurneysen emends it thus :
Gaei Assail d'or druimnech dir marb forsa-telgenn fer fir,
ni-eicherr imrol a glial acht cona n-gara "Iubar. "
The obscure nicaecher imrol is explained by the ni t<~it urehar n-imruill de of the prose text.
(11) I venture to translate anna cumga cltniss, "in its
narrowness of leather," as "into its case, or sheath, of leather." The last line of this quatrain is quite hopeless: I can make nothing of it but "no combat upon an unstable
bittern"—nonsense which even a struggle against the constraints of debide verse can hardly condone !
(14, 15) Thurneysen points out that these two quatrains have been combined by the prose narrator, who has made the two whelps into one. Luachra Lia, which has evaded
Hogan's Onomasticon, is probably a place as mythical as Iruaith, or Inis Findchairi in the next quatrain.
(16) 2560. A good example of the regular jussive use of ced: ced duit does not mean "you have permission to . . .,"
but " you must." When it is used it appears to be a
sarcastic meiosis, as when a saint tells a culprit, literally, "You have permission to be swallowed up in the earth" or "to be turned into stone."



NOTES ON SECTION VII. 341
(17). This quatrain is obviously a self-protecting- comment of the Christian poet, guarding himself against the possible risk of being accused of attaching too great importance to these vain stories.
(18-21). These quatrains are certainly intrusive, and belong to a story which has no connexion with that of the wergeld. The only link is its connexion with Tuirill, whose
name is here spelt differently in V (Picrell instead of Picrenn). The other MS., A, has introduced uniformity. Moreover they are fragmentary : quatrain 20 promises to tell the names of the lakes, a promise unfulfilled in the poem in
its present state. In quatrain 19, line 2570, Cnoc Archai is the hill of Uisnech. Quatrain 21 appears to be the beginning of a third poem relating to the same person, but the rest is gone ; for in 22 we return to the original narrative and follow the brethren in their search for the wergeld. The end of the story as here related differs in ioto from other versions. The brethren seem to fulfil the demands of Lug completely; and the poet, after a further reminder (line 2588) that the story is romance, not history, and after a pietistic interlude (quatrain 24), tells us that, not the brethren, but Lug it was that died.
Here we leave Liber Originwm (as defined, vol. ii, p. 166) with its rich, if lamentably reconstructed, mythological material, and return to the less valuable artificial parody of the Old Testament to which we have given the name Liber Occupationis. With great astonishment I have observed, in certain criticisms of the preceding volumes, evidence of an unwillingness to admit the presence of mythological matter in this text : I cannot imagine why. I have been challenged
rather illogically—to prove that such matter exists, before proceeding to discuss the document from a point of view which gives it its paramount, and its only value : apparently in unconsciousness of the obvious fact that the proof required proceeds automatically from the discussion. I must respectfully assure such critics that, in colloquial phrase, the boot
is on the other foot. There is not a human being in all the world, from the lowliest Arunta of Central Australia to the



342 NOTES ON SECTION VII.
most sublimated product of European civilization, from the most abject slave of superstition to the most fanatic sceptic,
who cannot provide the comparative mythologist with ample materials for a life-long study. If they believe that the people whose ideas find expression in the text before us were
exempt from this universal law, it is for them to prove itif they can. But they must be prepared to accept the inevitable nemesis : for they will ipso facto have proved that, their proteges were not human beings at all !

In presenting tliis volume to our ]\[embers, we feel
that a word of explanation is due to them.
Dr. R. A. S. Macalister's typescript was handed to
the printers in November, 1948, but they were unable to
start printing for various reasons, including the necessity
for new machinery. Dr. ]Macalister died in the early
part of 1950 and the printing had not been started, we
were left therefore with the Editor's typescript only.
Vov some time we tried to get another editor to take over
the book but could not succeed. Finally, in March, 1952,
we engaged the services of an educated reader, instructing
him to correct the proofs in such a way as to bring it
into conformity with Dr. J\Iacalister's typescript. Thus
the volume now issued represents the Editor's fii'st draft.

Introduction.
We now return to Ldher Occupationis, the history of the
CTaedil and their wanderings, after the long interruption caused by the intrusion of the originally independent Liber Praecursorum. In doing so, we immediately re-enter the scholastic atmosphere which we quitted when we passed from the Egyptian adventures of Nel, to the cosmogony of the Cessair pericope. The rest of the book not only
possesses no historical value—as is only too obvious ; in the form in which it is presented to us it has next to no
importance in the general field of Anthropology, except in so far as it may throw some sidelight rays upon magical beliefs and practices, or the like. Its chief interest is as
an object-lesson in the growth and methods of literary tradition. When I began to work on the present section I hoped that here, at least, it might be possiblie to combine the three redactions into a single text; but after struggling with the task for a few paragraphs I abandoned it as hopeless. Only
by continuing the practice of printing the parallel versions
in full can the chequered history of the compilation be satisfactorily set forth. I have allowed the composite text, so far as I had prepared it, to stand, in order to demonstrate
the essential artificiality, and the unmanageable clumsiness
with no compensating scientific gain—resulting from such a treatment of the material. This less important section is a suitable corpus uile for such a demonstration ; it would have been more complete if I had allowed all the trivialities of orthographical variation which I had noted to remaia
on record. In fact, about half of these have been excised as needless encumbrances.
' This name, when written in full, usually appears as Milid, in the
Nominative; proper names preserved orally have a tendency to become
perpetuated in one of the oblique cases. The form Mil, here used, is
rather a theoretical reconstruction than a form actually sanctioned by the MSS (it actually appears in A, once, in the course of H 385).

Why then is it impossible—for so it is—to establish a standard text for what is evidently a document produced by a conscious act of literary effort? The answer to this
question is obvious, and complete. As has already been indicated in Part I of this edition, p. xxxi, Liber Occupationis was originally composed, not in Irish, but in Latin. Its contents were taught, where such subjects were studied, by
oral instruction, not from books—thus in a measure carrying on the traditional educational 'methods of the Druidic schools, as these are descril^ed for us in an oft-quoted passage of Caesar's De Bello Gallico. The interspersed verses wBre mnemonics, which the students learnt by heart as a preliminary framework, and into which individual teachers fitted their own explanations, translations, para
phrases, or expansions, of the Latin prose histoiy. Not till after a lapse of many years would the substance of the
story be written do\vn, in the vernacular of the writersagain carrying on the Druidic tradition^ of oral as opposed
to written instruction—and then by different scholars, brought up in the divergent traditions of different schools; though the underlying Latin was doubtless still available,
to give a general unity to their transcripts. But there was never a standard Irish text from which the redactionary variants could all have been derived by ordinary transmission. It was also pointed out (same reference) that Liher Occupationis is merely a quasi-learned paa'ody of the story
of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites.^ fth, whom we left in Spain, espied Ireland from the top of Breogan's
Tower, as Moses espied the Promised Land from the summit
called "Pisgah." Despite the protests of his brethren, he
determined to seek it out. Arriving, he was met by certain of the inhabitants, who described for him the island and its rulers. These latter, at the moment, were involved in a
"It is unnecessary to remark that although ''druidic" precedent
has been invoked in the foregoing paragraphs, the documents a,s we have them were drawn up and taught by Qiristian teachers, working
by traditional methods which they liad inherited from tlieir
predecessors.
'We have already seen (vol. iv, p. 293) that B'Arbois de Jubainville
discerned how the "story of Moses, in tlie Bool of Exodus, likewise
inspired many of the legendary details in the mediaeval lives of
St. Patrick; see Bevue Celtjique ix, 111.

legal dispute, which Ith, being (like Moses) famous as a judge and a lawgiver, was able to settle. In doing so, he rashly pronounced .a eulogy on the country : the inhabitants, fearful lest he should carry back this good report to potential invaders, put him to death ; but his followers escaped, and returned with the tidings, and the body of their leader, to
Spain. An expedition set forth to avenge him ; after meeting with difficulties and losses, it succeeded in effecting a landing, and in gaining a victory in a battle at Sliab Mis.
In spite of this, however, after a colloquy with the kings
at Temair, the invaders were obliged—by no obvious
constraint—to return to the sea, to face the difficulties of landing once again, and to fight a second successful battle to secure their footing on the countr^^* By the death of the original leader before the invasion begins; by the spying out of the land, and the favourable report; by the
original success followed by a temporary defeat; we are
reminded, again and again, of the Israelite story. Even in incidental details there are points of contact; thus, the Gaedil were hookwinked into harbouring the Cruithne, as Joshua was hoodwinked into harbouring the Gibeonites; and the analogy is continued in the sequel, where we find a miniature Domesday or Lamidrmmahok (just as in the Boolt of Joshua and the subsequent Biblical histories) •detailing the division of the land among the immigrant families, and a later partition of the country; followed by a list of kings, in form closely resembling the Books of the Kings of the Hebrews. Here and there extraneous incidents,
easily detachable interpolations, interrupt the story : such are the interviews with the three w^omen Eriu, Banba and Fodla ; the story of Lugaid and Fial ; and the story of Odba. These must have existed, separately, as minor sagas, being afterwards incorporated rather loosely in the text.
As hinted above, I had drawn up a formidable list of
MS variae lectiones ; but in the final revision I reduced
these to a manageable bulk by excising orthographical and
* Conceivably the double invasion, which seems quite pointless, was suggested by the Israelite set-back in the battle of Ai, after their
successful siege of Jericho (Joshua. Vii); but on the whole it is more
likely that the story of, the two battles is a conflation of two
independent versions of what was originally one narrative of one (legendary) event.



4 SECTION VIII.
other trivialities. An elaborate prefatory analysis, and
long explanatory notes, sueh as were necessary in dealing with Liher Praecursorum, would scarcely be appropriate to
this essentially artificial section. A few observations on specific details are all that appear needful.
I. The Landfall of Ith (1[ 379). In its earliest form the story may have left Ith and his followers at the "Brentracht/ ' without specifying which of the two or more places of tliis name was intended. Southern histories favoured a site, now unidentified, in the Corkaguiney
peninsula, familiar to themselves; those of the North sought it in a Northern site, more convenient to Ailech, and where the presence of a "Mag nitha'' seemed to offer confirmatory evidence. The Southern landing obliged Itli to pursue the
following lengthy itinerary
Corco Duibne—Corkaguiney, Co. Kerry.
Ciarraige Luachra—North Kerry.
Luachair Dedad—Southern part of the same region.
Mag Cliach—S.E. Limerick.
fiile—E. Tipperary and S. Offaly.
Tir Cell—North of the same region.
Mide—Meath.
Luigne—Lune, Co. Meath.
Sliab Guaire—Slieve Gorey, W. Cavan.
Feda Fernmaige—the woods of Farney. Co. Monaghan.
Fossad Clair Fernmaige—North of the last.
Sliab Bethach—Slieve Beagh, Monaghan barony. Co. Monaghan.
Sliab Toad—"Bessie Bell" Mountain, Co. Tyrone.
The Marsh of Tir Sirlaim—unidentified, presumably North of the last station.
Modarn—somewhere about the confluence of the Mourne and Foyle rivers.
Ailech—the well-known hilltop fort west of Londonderry.
II. The colloquy on the heach (H 380). "Inis Elga" as a name for "Ireland" is familiar, but its status is indeterminate ; whether it was ever in current official use, or was merely a poetical by-name; whether the nominative is Elg or Elga; and whether its meaning is "noble" or "pig",
or something else not recognized by these guesses. Oathmr Crofind is familiar as an old name for Temair Breg (Tara). The discrepant versions of the matter in dispute among the kings add to the evidence that our text, in its several forms,



INTRODUCTION. 5
has gathered various strands of tradition into its artificial framework.
III. The death of " Ollum" m 383, 384). This is in
essence an alternative version of the fate of Ith, in which the Tnatha De Danann appear in their character of
"demons"—for they are undoubtedly the slayers, though not
specified as such. The story is not in L, though F includes
it ; it was taken into the text of W at TJ 384, wher« it breaks
the sense very awkwardly. No reason for the murder is assigned in this alternative version, and the identity of the victim with Ith is not recognized ; indeed, a further interpolator in R^ has intruded the information that the victim, elsewhere unnamed, was an otherwise imknown ''Ollum"^. In addition, the paragraph contains a list of four places,
known to the glossator, bearing the name Mag nttJia, and
explaining it after the manner of Dinnsenchas. Of these places there is nothing to say more than what the paragraph contains, that they were respectively in the neighbourhood of Loch Foyle, Loch Swilly, Limerick, and the territory of
the Dessi—presumably Deeies in Waterford, not Deece in Meath, as the narrative implies a maritime region.
IV. The death of Ith (^ 384). The three texts tell the same story, but with verbal differences which confirm the thesis that the prose developed in several forms out of a Latin original. The Latin compiler may have borrowed from an independent saga with some such title as Aided^ Ifha nieic Bregoin; no such tale is eniunerated in the
oi^cial lists,*' but its existence is suggested by a quotation in the R^R^ versions. It will be noticed that an explanation of the name Mag nitha, differing from that in H 383, is here
given.
V. The voyage to Ireland (H 385). At first simple, this paragraph has been swelled into a terrible complication by scribal insertions and (we must add) perversions. Its
* He can. hardly be dissociated from ' ^ Ollom, son of Dalbaeth, ' '
of whom we hear for a moment under the T.D.D. ante 1[ 315.
® On which see Brian O'Looney, "On ancient historic tales in the Irish language"; Proceedings, R.I.A., vol. xv (1872), p. 215.



6 SECTION VIII.
history can be reconstructed hy\ a careful comparison of the two prose texts and the associated verse, Toisig na 1-loingse (Poem LXVII), The oenn is the simple statement
at the beginning of the first prose text :
''Learned men relate that the Gaedil were conducted to
Ireland by 36 leaders, to wit
10 sons of Bregon (Brego, Bile. Blad, Cualu, Cuaiilnge, Fuat, Muirt.hemne, 1th, Nar, Ebliu). 1 son of Bile (Mil). 8 sons of Mil (Bonn, Golptlia, Aniorgen, Eber, Ir, £reni6n, Airech, flrennan). 3 sons of Bremen (Muimne, Luigne, Laigne). 4 sons of Eber (Er, Orba, Feron. Fergna). 10 champions (Bres^ Buas, Buaigne, <Caicher, Fulmjin, Mantan, Setga. Sobairce, Etan, Goisten).
36
To this bald statement the following additions were made
from time to time:
1. An attempt to explain how these facts were ascertained, by calling on the immortal antediluvians, Tiian and Fintan.
to dictate tliem from their personal knowledge to certain early saints. Tliat this childish story is no part of the original narrative is sufficiently indicated by its insertion at the beginning of the first text and at the end of the second. 3. The numbers of the servitors and their ships, prefixed to the first prose text. Their names, suffixed to the same text, are most likely a yet later insertion; and give a strong impression of being artificial inventions, not genuine traditions. 3. The explanation of certain geographical details, after the manner of Dinnsenehas, by the names of the several leaders.
Possibly this turns the document into a sort of Domesday Book, suggesting that the descendants of the owners of those personal names had some sort of territorial claim over the regions bearing the geographical names. The sanctions of ecclesiastical and scholastic tradition are put forth in confirmation of the derivations.
We cannot blame the scriljos for losing their way in a text whicli had become so confused, and which was available
to them in clumsy MSS only. The list in tlie poem (juoted reduces the sons of Bregon by omitting Ith (already dead), by diminishing Blad and Bile to metrical chevilles, and inserting in their stead INIil and T^ugaid ; increases the sons of Mil by duplicating :fiber; and increases the champions



INTRODUCTION. 7
by duplicating Siiirge and inserting- En, Un, and Palap
(the last probably an adaptation of the Classical Pelopa). Evidently the later copyists were perplexed by the inclusion of the dead Ith, tin, En, and Mil, and of the vet unborn
Irial.
The first list of servitors appears to be a disarrangement
of an alphabetical list of plains, derived from some document
of a geographical nature. It is possible that the compiler misread the word tyuig, "plain", written with an open
topped a, for mug, "serf". Perhaps "Mag Mor", king of
Spain, of whom we have heard already, owed his existence to a similar oversight. The names are in alliterative groups of threes, suggesting that tlie fundamental document was in verse form; a slight readjustment would make it at least
acrophonically alphabetic, as under
Aidne, Ai, Assal — Adal, Adar, Aire,
Cuib, Cliu, Cera — Dul, Dese, Dela,
Fea, Femen, Fera — Life, Line, Ligen,
Mede, Morba, Mide — Saer, Slan, Traig.
Of the interpolations, the most interesting, if not the most comprehensible, is one (Ij 385, just after reference-mairk (^^) ) suggesting an identity between Nuadu Airgetlam, the leader of the Tuatha De Danann, and Irial Faid, one of the early
chieftains of the Milesian expedition. And as it is more than probable that Irial Faid is primarily the same personage as larbonel Faid, who figures among the Nemedian leaders, we can see with what a complication of cross-currents of tradition the ancient historians were
faced—and a fortiori we also, when we try to make sense of the material which they have transmitted to us.
VI. Paragraphs of ' ' Dinnsenchas" character. At the outset we are introduced to the three eponymous women, £riu, Banba, and Fodla. The three texts offer notable variations in detail, which might form the subject of a monograph ; here wB can only glance at them. The funda
' This form of the name is here retained, as (with a variant Iriel) it is universally adopted in the MSS; some modern scholars prefer larel.



8 SECTION VIII.
mental idea of this fragmentary saga is the importance of
the name as a part of the person to whom it belongs : so
long as the names of the women are preserved by being imposed on the island, so long are they assured of immortality. Banba's remark, that the invaders have not come with good luck, may contain a protest to whatever powers permitted the landing in the face of the impotent
.spells of the Tuatha De Danann; or it may convey a discouraging warning to the incomers that the day of their
arrival was an unlucky day—compare a similar warning said to have been uttered to St. Oiaran by a druid when the saint began to build his church at Clonmacnois. Amorgen's
answer is to the effect that the landing was fated—a matter
of aroykj;. The addition to the story from the book called the Quire
of Druimm Sneclita is of extreme interest. It underlines what was suggested (Part II, p. 172) as to Cessair having been the name, or rather one of the names, of the Irish Mac/na Mater. For here Banba is virtually identical with
Cessair. She claims an antediluvian origin—older even
tlian Noe—and to have lived at Tul Tuinne like Fintan, Cessair 's companion. This corroborates the explanation of the Cessair story as a cosmogonic myth. It is little wonder
that a pious and simple-minded glossator found a story which envisaged the survival of any person outside the
privileged occupants of the Ark to be "surprising"! It is> also interesting to notice how the relations of the women with the invaders oscillate between hostility and friend
liness : Eriu, the chief eponym, warmly welcomes themthough another strand in the tangled tale makes her fashion demons out of sods of turf to oppose and repel them. In
^ 389 we have a similar story—a battle, lor which tire ordinary framework of the narrative has no room, in which the Tuatha De Danann summon ''monsters" to aid them. We may compare the monsters summoned in an earlier ( ?) narrative (interpolated from an unknown source into
O'Clery's version of L.C), to defend Conaing's Tower against the Tuatha De Danann themselves. The retirement after
this battle "to a mountain over against Loch Dergderc''
the Southern Loch Derg—may be a a-ominiscence of the retirement of the antediluvian Fintan to the same region.



INTRODUCTION. 9
The amusing etymology offered for Gabar Life ("the Liffey Watershed") is a good example of Dinnsen-chm methods. Further material of the same kind appears in ]\]\ 387,
388, in the explanations of Sliab ]\[is, Odba, Temair, Inber Colptha, the Gravemoiinds of Tech Diiin, the name "Hog
Island" applied to Ireland, Crlen Fais, Seota's Girave—now
marked by an absurd spurious Ogham inscription— and
Inber Scene. In all these cases, the place-name came first, and the person or thing to account for it was invented by the etymologizer. Inber Scene is a typical case ; Scene has been evolved, to account for Orosius's version of the name
of the Shannon estuary ! jNIore interesting is the story to account for Loch Luigdech and Inber Feile. Loch Luigdech is generally identified with Loch Currane, behind Waterville ;
if this be right, thB lake-estuary in which Fial performed her ablutions cannot have an^-thing to do with the river Feale in North Kerry. The tabu on nudity, which is prominent in this story, also appears in certain well-known stories of Cti Chulaind ; a comparison of the versions reveals a difference of opinion as to whether Fial's emotions were excited at seeing her husband, or being herself seen, in that condition. The fatal consequence shows that the trouble was actually a breach of a tabu, not a mere sense of embarrassment. These paragraphs have the further interest of giving us some extracts from what we may describe as a "book of
spells", including the famous verses of AmorgBn. Here we need only refer to the apparently proverbial rh^Tne, or
jingle, nir folHh. As Ith, not Lugaid, is there mentioned
a harmonizing gloss has been found necessary to justify its
quotation—it cannot have had anything to do with the boat
race story in its original application. It seems to have the character of a didactic 'aphorism, based on some storA' other
than that in the text—of which, indeed, it may have
suggested the aetiological invention. But in its present setting it is treated rather as one of the magical spells with which the narrative is riddled. These few ^remarks must suffice; but they are enough to show that close ^examination of even an artificial document like this, conducted by the methods of modern Anthropology, may reveal pearls of great price to the explorer.

And there came also Lugaid s. Ith, the hard valorous powerful warrior, to avenge his father. So that those are tlie company of chieftains who came into Ireland with the Sons of Mil, the ten sons of Bireogan, and the eight sons of Mil, the five sons of Erimon, and the four sons of Eber Finn, and the
ten champions. And there came thither Gosten and Setga
and Ith s. Breogan. And learned men say that Mil came not into Ireland ; and others say that the three kings died of
plague before coming into Ireland,
namely Mil s. Bile, and Oige. and Uige, the two sons of Allod si. Noenel.
The twenty-four servitors as under; Aidne, Ai, Assal, Mede, Morba, Mide, Cuib, Cliu, Cera, Saer, Slan, Life, Line, Ligen, Traig, Dul, Adal, Aire, Dese, Dela, Fea, Femen, Fera.
Moreover Lugaid s. 1th came also, the hard valorous warrior with the strength of an hundred, to avenge his father along with them all.
Those are the names of the ehief servitors, these are the names of the subordinate servitors below, who are not very prominent in the books: Medar, Ladar, Medon, Pida, Cath, Ruis, Cailna, Mad, Dena, Cacha, Bonn, Finnu, Cer, Coirche, Meadba, Ailim, Bir, Baschon, Forena, Lugba, Sega, Seilgenn, Seg, Mar, Aig. They say that fiber had sons besides these, Caur, Capa, Corunn, Edor, Arb, Airrbe. Eremon had other six sons, Edenn, A[l]an, Aine, Caichear, and Caicher Cemda ; and that family is not usually brought into prominence.

386. One of the eight sons of Mil, Erannan, the
yonngest of the family, he it was who went up the mast
to spy out Ireland, and fell from the mast into the sea
[on to the rock, F.]. And his grave is in Inber Scene, and the grave of Scene wife of Amorgen on the other
side. She died on the ,sea at their estuary, and Amorgen said : The harbour wherein we shall land,
shall bear the name of Scene. The sons of Mil made a contention in rowing as they came to Ireland from
the place where they saw Ireland away from them; and Ir son of Mil advanced the length of a murchrech^"^
beyond every ship. Eber Donn, the eldest of the family,
was envious, and he said
It is not lucky
that Ir leapeth beyond Itli,

[that is, beyond Lugaid son of Ith]. Then the oar that was in the hand of Ir broke, so that he fell
backward, and died in the following night ; and his body was taken to Sceilic, behind the Southern promontory of Corco Duibne. Every time that the Sons of Mil came up with
Ireland, the demons would frame that the port w^as, as it were, a hog's back; whence Ireland is called "Hog
Island". They skirted around Ireland three times, and landed at last in Inber Scene. Sorrowful were Eber Finn and Erimoii and Amorgen
after the death of their brother ; and they said : It were
right that Eber Donn should have no share of the land,
regarding which he was envious of his brother Ir. On
the morrow Scene and Erannan were buried in Inber Scene. They two were both buried; their mounds and

At the end of three days and three nights thereafter the Sons of Mil broke the battle of Sliab Mis against
demons and Fomoraig, that is, against the Tuatha De JDanann. It is there that Fas {sic lege) fell, the wife
of Un s. Uicce, after whom "the grave of Fas" is named, between Sliab Mis and the sea.
Scota d. Pharao king of Egypt, also died in that battle—the wife of ifirimon s. Mil. For Mil s. Bile went a-voyaging
into Egypt, four ships' companies strong, and he took Scota to wife, and Erimon took her after him. In that night on which the sons of Mil came into Ireland, was the burst of Loch Luigdech in lar-Mumu.
' ' Sliab Mis "—that means the worst mountain which they found after coming into Ireland, for there they fought their first battle in Ireland.

389. The Sons of Mil fought the battle of Life; there were monsters
in shapes of giants which the Tiiatha De Danann had sumnaoned to themselves by druidry. The Sons of Mil (fiber, firimon and Ir), fought the
battle valiantly. The horse (gabar) of Erinion fell there, nnde Gabar Life nominatur. They came thereafter till they were in the mountain over against [Loch] Dergderc.
390. The sons of Mil had colloquy with Banba in Sliab Mis. Said Banba nnto them : If it be to take Ireland ye have come, not right were the good-fortune in which ye have come^''^ It is
by necessity, said Amorgen Gluingel, the poet. A gift from
you to me then, said she. Wliat gift? said they. That my
name may be on this island, said she. What is thy name? said the.y. Banba, said she. L«t it be a name for this island, said
Amorgen.
The Book of Druim Snechta says that Amorgen enquired after her
race. Of the progeny of Adam am I, said she. Which race of the sons
of Noe is thine? said he. I am older than Noe, said she; on a peak of
a mountain w'as I in the Flood; to this present mound the waves of the riood attained. Therefore is it called Tul Tuinnef [But the foregoing
is a surprising extract.] Thereafter they sing spells against her, and
drive her away from them.
391. They had colloquy with Fotla in Eblinne. She spake with them in like manner, and desired that her name should be upon the island. Said Amorgen : Let Fotla be a name upon this island.
392. They had colloquy with firiu in Uisnech. She said unto them : Warriors, said she, welcome to you. Long have
soothsayers had [knowledge of] your coming. Yooirs shall be this island for ever; and to the east of the world there shall not be a better island. No race shall there be, more numerous than yours. Good is that, said Amorgen; good is the jirophecy. Not right were it to thank her, said Eber Donn,

eldest of the sons of Mil; thank our gods and our own might. To thee 'tis equal, said Eriu; thou shalt have no profit of
this island, nor shall thy progeny. A gift to me, ye sons of
Mil, and ye children of Breogan, said she ; that my name shall be on this island. It shall be its principal name, said Amorgen.
The Book of Druim Sneclita says that it was in Sliab Mis that firiu had colloquy with them, and that she formed great hosts to oppose them,
so that they were fighting with them. But their druids and poets sang
spells to them, and they saw that these were only sods of the mountain
peat-mosses. (Thence comes the name Sliab Misse.) And that it was
Fotla wlio had colloquy with them in Uisnech.
393. The sons of Mil and of Bregon went on, till
Ihey were in Druim Chain, that is, Temair. The three
kings of Ireland, Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, and Mac Greine,
were there. They pronounced judgement against the
sons of Mil, that they [themselves] should have the
island to the end of three days, free from assault, from assembly of battle, or from giving of hostages ; for they
were assured that they (the invaders) would not return,
because druids would make ,spells behind them, so that
they should not be able to come again. We shall adjudge
it, said Mac Cuill s. Cermat, as Amorgen your own judge shall pronounce to you; for if he should give a false
judgement, he [aliter, you] would die at our hands.
Give the judgement, Amorgen, said fiber Donn. I
pronounce it; ,said Amorgen. Let this island be left
to them. How far shall we go? said Eber. Past just nine waves, said Amorgen. This is the first judgement
given in Ireland. Amorgen cecinit

in distress by reason of the sea. A wind of wizards is

406. There was a contention between the ,sons of Mil
concerning the kingship, that is, between Eber and
Erimon. Amorgen was brought to them to arbitrate
between them, and he said : The heritage of the chief,
Donn, to the second, Erimon; and his heritage to Eber
after him. But Eber would not accept that—only a division of Ireland. These are the first three judgements that were given among the sons of Mil in Ireland : the judgement that Amorgen gave in Temair,
and that decision in Sliab Mis, and the decision that
Amorgen gave in Cenn tSaile in Mumu upon the deer
and roes and quadrupeds; as the poet said
Poem no. LXXV.
407. In the end there were six chieftains southward and seven chieftains northward who came there ; and Eber had the kingship southward and Erimon the
kingship northward. The six in the South were Eber
himself, Lugaid s. Itli, Etan s. Oicce, Un s. Uicce, Caicher, Fulman. The seven in the North were Erimon, Eber s.
Ir, Amorgen, Gosten, Setga, Sobairce, and the seventh
was Surge, Of these matters did Roigne the poet speak,
the son of Ugoine the Great, to Mai son of Ugoine his
brother, when Mai asked him : Sing of thine expedition.
Then is it that Raigne said
Poem no. LXXVI.
408. Or they say that they were twice six men, namely
the six sons of Mil and the six sons of Breogan—Erimon,
Eber, Lugaid, Amorgen, Colptha, Ir; Brego, Bile, Fuat, Blad, Cualu, Cuailnge. In this wise did the Gaedil take Ireland; finit of the Takings of Ireland dowm to this.

409. What is the true story of the Sons of Mil? [Their origin is] a people that is in the mountain of Armenia, called
Hiheri. They had a famous king, Mil s. Bile s. Nema. He
was holding the kingship against his father's brother, Refloir s. Nema; and he came with four ships' companies a-voyaging. There were fifteen wedded couples in each ship, and in addition an unwived hireling. They had two famous leaders, Uicce and Oicee. They went out upon the Caspian Sea, upon the Outer Ocean, and came around Asia south-Bast, to Taprobane Island. Three months had they therein. They had three other months upon the sea, and at last reached Egypt, at the end of 1354 years after the first Taking of Ireland by Partholon ; 914 years after the drowning of Pharao in the Red Sea. They reached Egypt. Pharao Nectanebus was king of Egypt at that time,
and he was the 45th king after Pharao Cenchres, who was
drowned in the Red Sea. He had 8 [7'ecte 16] years over Egypt till he was drowned. [Pharao Acherres, 8 years, omitted.] Pharao Cherres was king after him, 15 years. It is well to know that Pharao was the name of every king in Egypt, as every king in Rome is called Caesar, and every king in Alexandria is called Ptolemaeus : de quihus dicitur . . .

years, and he [the king] gave him his daughter, Scota. Now that was the
time when Alexander the Great s. Philip, came into Asia; and be brought
Egypt under his authority, and drave Pharao Nechtanebus forth from
Egypt into Ethiopia; and he first drave Artaxerxes, another time, into
Egypt. Thereafter a royal city is founded by Alexander in Egypt,
.-Uexandria by name, and the native rule of Egypt was then taken away,
and the Greeks took autliority therein; and the rule of Egj-pt was in the possession of the Greeks of Alexandria from that onward. So it is then that Mil came from Egypt to his owti people. Finit.

(a) This list of Egyptian kings is taken, from the Chronicle of Eusebius; the
names are here given as they appear in the Latin text of the translation of
Hieronymus, from which our compiler drew his information. Later, we shall find
cumulative evidence tlxat the MS. of Eusebius at the compiler's disposal was a
transcript of the Colbertine text, if not actually that MS. itself; here it gives an
easy explanation of the corruption of the name " Vafres " into " Hupriphis '\
This is evidently a combination of " uapris " which the scribe wrote, with " uafris "
into which a corrector changed it. " Nechod " and " Bochor " also approximate to
Colbertine readings. On, the other hand, " Encepros " for " Eneepsos " is .a mistake
of the Irish scribes, and there is no justification for " Dremendis " in the Colbertine
MS. Nor must we overlook the fact that several names in the list are omitted in
the Colbertine MS. which are duly recorded in their proper places in the Irish list.

Island". And they skirted aix)und Ireland three times and thereafter landed in Inber Slaine (or Scene).
412. And they landed, and came thereafter on to Sliab Mis, where Banba met them, with her drnidic and magic hosts in
her company. Amorgen asked of her, What is thy name?
said he. Banba, said she, and from me is the island named Banba's Island. Thereafter they made their way to Sliab Eiblinne, where Fotla met them, and the poet asked of her in
like wise. What is thy name? said he. Fotla, said she, is my
name, and from me is the island named. They came to Uisnech of ]Mide, and there found Eriu, and the poet asked of her, What is thy name? She said that it was Eriu, and that from her the island was named.
413. Then they came to Liathdruim, that is, to Temair ; and Ethor, Cethor and Tethor met them there, with their druidie hosts. They demanded of the Sons of Mil battle, or kingship, or satisfaction, in the matter of the land. The Tuatha said :
We shall give, said they, as your own poet shall adjudge to you, for if he should give a false judgement against us he shall die at our hands. 414. The Book of Driiim Sneehta says, that it was in Sliab Mis that £riu had converse with them; and that she formed great hosts which were
combating with them. Their druids and poets sang spells against thetn, so that they saw that they were only sods of peat and of the mountain.
Whence comes "Sliab Mi&" (n) And that it was there that :Eriu said: Warriors, said she, welcome to you; long is your coming hither known to

soothsayers. Yours shall be this island for ever, and there shall be no island of like size that shall be better, between this and the East of the World. There shall be no race more perfect than your race for ever.
Good is that, said Amorgen; Nor to her were it right, to give thanks, said
Donn, eldest of the sons O'f Mil, but to our gods and to our might. 'Tis alike to thee, said Eriu ; thou shalt have' no profit of this island nor
shall thy progeny. A gift to me, ye sons of Mil and progeny of Breogan,.
s-aid she; that my name shall be on this island. It shall be its chief name
for ever, said Amorgen. And he made the like promise to the other two
women; and it was Fotla who conversed with them in Uisnech. [The above
is an extract from another book Lehor na Huidri.]
415. Give the judgement, Amorgen, said Eber Donn. I shall give it, said Amorgen. Let this island be left to them.
How far shall we go? said Eber. Just over nine waves, said Amorgen. That is the first judgement that was ever given in Ireland, from the Sons of Mil.
Poeyn no. LXXI.
If it were my counsel ye should follow. Sons of Mil, said Donn s. Mil, it is in battle it should be [settled]. Squander not thy strength, said the druids, remember not, nor come into Ireland for ever. The Sons of Mil came from Temair to Inber Scene, and they came out, over nine sea waves. The druids wrought druidic winds behind them, so that the bottom sea-gravel was put upon the surface of the sea. So great was the tempest against them, that the wind drave them westward till they were
weary. A wind of wizards is this, said Donn s. Mil. It is, said Amorgen, unless it be over the sail. Erannan, youngest of the sons of ]\Iil, climbed up the mast, and said, It is not over the sail. Then he fell from the mast, and fell upon the rocks, or upon the planks of the ship, so that his limbs were scattered.

Poem no. LXXII
and there fell a calm upon them on the sea forthwith. Then Donn son of Mil said : I shall put, said he, under the edge of javelin and sword all that are in the island now, only let land
he reached. The wind concentrated upon the ship where Donn The king was, and Donn was drowned at the Sandhills ; whence
Tech Duinn derives its name. Twenty-four men and twelve women and four hirelings and four attendants, that is the tally of those who were drowned in that ship. [The grave-mound of every one of them is there.]
417. And it is there that Dil wife of Donn was drowned, ut dicunt alU. She was a daughter of Mil, and firimon himself put a sod upon her, and
said : Here is a sod [fot] upon Dil. Unde Fotla, ut alii aiunt. Odba daughter of Mil, mother of the three sons of :6rim6n, of Muimne, Luign*,.
and LaigTie, it is she whom firimon deserted in Spain, and took Tea in lier place. But Odba came in a separate ship, with her sons, from the
South, and it is they who sustained her. She died in Odba, unde Odbe dicitur.
418. The Sons of Mil came into Inber Scene and Inber Feile, find firimon went left-hand-ways toward Ireland, till he landed
in Inber Colptha. That was in the year when Alexander broke the great battle in which Darius the Great son of Arsames fell, at the end of two hundred thirty and seven years, save three years, after the slaying of Baltasar, and after the capture of Babylon by Cyrus son of Darius, whereby the Captivity was

released from the Babylonian bondage, according to synchronism and
harmony. If we follow according to common belief, it was in the Third
Age of the World that the Sons of Mil came into Ireland, a Thursday
according to the day of the week, on the seventeenth day of the moon,
on the kalends of May according to the day of the solar month. The
company of the sons of Mlil took Ireland, and then it was that Amorgen
the poet made this poem, as he set his right foot upon land, dicens Poem no. LXIX.
Finit. Amorgen sang also at that time to drive fishes into creeks
Poem no. LXX.
419. [At the end of three days and three nights thereafter
the Sons of i\Iil broke the battle of Sliab j\Iis against demons and giants.] They left many of their people and of their
Momen on the coast of Ireland at that time after they had gone to Temair when the judgement was passed upon them, and Vv'hen the druidie wind took hold of them : eight of their chieftains accompanying the king, Donn, as well as Bile s.
Brige s. Breogan, and Airech Februa, Buas, Bres, and Buaigne, who were drowned in the same ship along with Donn, [and Cuailnge and Fuat, who were slain in the battle of Tailtiu].
And Ir died after that and was buried in Sceilig ; and Erannan
died in the estuary after falling from the mast. And they left
the flower of their queens likewise on the same occasion. Fas
wife of tin. s. Ucce fell—from her are named "The Grave of Fas" and "Glenn False" between Sliab Mis and the sea. Scota daughter of Pharao king of Egypt, wife of Erimon, died also in that battle ;
Mil was her father— sic in aliis

in the matter of the kingdom, so that Amorgen was brought to arbitrate
between them. And Amorgen said : The inheritance of the chief, Donn,
to the second, Erimon, and his iniieritance to fiber after him. For these are the first three judgements given among the sons of Mil in Ireland;
the judgement that Amorgen gave in Temair, and that judgement in Sliab
Mis, and the judgement which Amorgen gave in Cenn tSaile in Des-Munm
over deer and roes and quadrupeds. TJt poeta dixit.

433. Forty-eight wedded co^^ples accompanied the Sons of ]\Iil, and four hirelings, as well as Scota daughter of Pharao, on the sea, to seek for Ireland. So on that occasion they came to take Ireland at Inber Slaine [Scene, M], because it was prophesied that a famous company should take Ireland in Inber Slaine. But ever\' time that they drew nigh to Ireland, the demons would frame that the harbour to which they would come should be [as it were] a hog's back. They skirted around Ireland three times, and thereafter they landed in Inber Scene
(sic).
434. Erannan, the j'oungest of the sons of Sill, climjjed into
the mast, to see how far it was from them to the land. He fell out, and his limbs were scattered about the rocks of the sea* As he died, his head was put into his mother's breast, and she sent forth a sigh at his death. 'Tis no wonder, said his mother : whoso is sent between two emperors, er»?ept he have
parted from the emperor from whom he hath gone, he hath
not attained to the emperor to whom he has come.^"^ It was so that day, that there arose a terrible tempest, and it parted
from the rest the ship wherein was Donn s. Mil—its company
was twenty-four men, four hirelings, and twelve women—and they were drowned at the Sand-hills in the sea to the West,
whence it is named " Tech Duinn ". A Thursday, on the kalends of May, the Sons of Mil came into Ireland in Inber Scene ; they had sent out their fleet on the seventeenth of the

died there—others say that Dellsaire was another name for her ; her grave was dug on the estuary, and the grave of Erannan on the other side. She is one of the seven wives of the Sons of Mil, and these are their names : Tea, Fial, f^as, Lil)en, Odba,
Scota, Scene. Vnde dicitur
Poem no. LXXX.
So Amorgen said [to his brethren, M] : The harbour where
we land, it shall bear the name of Scene. [Or perhaps it was on the sea that she died.] The Sons of Mil made a contention in rowing as they came toward Ireland, that is, from the place where they saw Ireland in front of them ; and Ir s. Mil left a muircrech to every ship. Eber Donn s. Mil, who was the eldest of the family, envied him, and said : It is not lucky
that Ir should advance beyond Ith—that is, beyond Lugaid s. ith. As he said that, the oar that was in the hand of Ir broke and he fell backward, and died on the following night, and his body was taken to Sceilig, west of the Southern Promontory of
Corcu Duibne. [So that thence was Sceilig named, " a tale
under a flagstone"—M.] Now every time that the Sons of ^lil would reach land in Ireland, the demons would frame that the harbour was [as it were] a hog's back; so that thence is the
island of Ireland called " Hog Island ''. They skirted around Ireland three times, and at last they landed, on Inber Scene. Sorrowful were Eber Finn and Erimon and Amorgen after ihe loss of their brother, and they said that it were right that Eber Donn should have no share of the land about which he had envied his brother, Ir s. Mil. On the morrow Erannan and Scene died, and they buried the two there, and their gravemounds and burials are there still.

435. As Amorgen Gluingel s. ]\Iil set his right foot upon Ireland, he said the following
Poem 710. LXIX.
And he spake this lay also, conjuring fish into the creeks
Poem no. LXX.
At the end of three days and three nights thereafter the Sons of Mil broke the battle of Sliab Mis against demons and giants, that is, against the Tuatha De Danann. Fas wife of [tin s.] Uicce fell, eponym of the "Grave of Fas" and the "Valley of Fas," between Sliab Mis and the sea ; and in that battle died Scota, daughter of Pharao kmg of Eg^-pt, who was wife of
Erimon s. Mil. For Mil s. Bile went into Egypt a-voyaging, with the crew of seven ships, and he took Scota to wife ; and Erimon took her after him. In that night in which the Sons: of Mil came into Ireland, was the burst of Loch Luigdech in lar-Mumu. Sliab Mis, that is, the worst mountain that they found in Ireland, for it is there that they fought their very lirst battle in Ireland.
436. Lugaid s. Ith used to bathe him in Loch Luigdech, and Fial wife of Lugaid s. Ith was bathing in the river that flows into [aliter and out of] the lake. Her husband came to her naked, so that she saM^ her husband's nakedness, and died thereafter of shame, in Loch Luigdech. Or because it was her husband who saw her, that her chastity overcame her.
437. The Sons of Mil fought the battle of Life. There were monsters in the form of giants, sent by the Tuatha De Danann against them, by wizardry. The Sons of Mil, £ber and Eremon.

fought the battle valiantly. The steed [gabar] of Eremon fell
there. [Hence is the name Gabar Life : or Life was the name
of his horse.] Inde Life nominatw. [That is to say, " from which it is named".] ^''^
438. Thereafter they came till they were in the mountain over against Loch Dergderc. The sons of Mil and Banba conversed together there. [Or it is at Sliab Mis they conversed
with Banba, and wherever it was, this is what she said to them] : If it be to take Ireland ye have come, and so intend, not right were the chance in which ye have come. It is,
however, said Amorgen Gluingel the poet. A boon to me from
you ! said she. What is it ? said they. That my name be upon
this island, said she. What is thy name? said they. Banba, said she. Banba shall be a name for this island, said Amorgen
Gluingel. The Book of Druim Snechta says that Amorgen
asked of her as to her race. Of the progeny of Adam am I,,
said she. Of which race of the sons of Noe are thou? said he. I am elder than Noe, said she; upon this mountain was I in the Flood; to this hill, said she, came the waters of the Flood; thence is it called [Tul] Ttiinde. However, that
foregoing extract is extraordinary. Thereafter they sing spells against her, and Banba departed from them. They had colloquy with Fotla in Eibliu. She spake with them in like wise, and begged that her name should be upon the island. Amorgen said : Fotla shall be a name for the island.
439. They had colloquy with Eriu in Uisnech. She spake thus with them : Warriors, welcome to you. Long have
soothsayers known of your coming hither. Yours shall be this island for ever, and no island of its size to the East of the

world shall be better, and no race shall he more perfect than
your race, for ever. Good is that prophecy, said Amorgen. Not to her is thanks therefore due, said Donn, the eldest of the Sons of Mil, but to our gods and to our powers. To say so is not thy concern, said !firiu ; thou shalt have no profit of the
island, nor shall thy progeny dwell within it. A boon to me, ye sons of Mil and progeny of Breogan, said she ; that my name
shall be upon this island. It shall be its name for ever, said
Amorgen. The Book of Druim Snechta says that it was in Sliab ]\Iis that Eriu spake with them, and that she formed great hosts against them, so that these were combating with them. But their druids and poets sang them spells, and they saw that they were only sods of the mountain bog; that thence is its name, Sliab Mis; and that it was Fotla who had converse with them in Uisnech.
440. Thereafter the Sons of Mil and of Breogan went till they were in Druim Cain, that is in Temair. The three kings
of Ireland w^ere there, Mac Cuill, IMac Cecht and Mac Greine. They demanded of the Sons of i\Iil that theirs should be the island to the end of three days, free from rapine, or from submission, or from assembly of battle : in the assurance that [the invaders] would not return, because they would make spells behind them, so that they should not be al^le to come
again. We shall give, said Mac Cuill s. Cermait, as Amorgen your ow^n judge shall give you ; for if he should utter a false judgement, he would die at our hands. Give the judgement Amorgen, said fiber Donn. I shall give it, said Amorgen ; let
the island be left to them. How far shall we go? said Eber. Out over nine waves, said Amorgen. That is the first judgement that was given in Ireland, among the Sons of Mil. Poem no. LXXL

441. If it were my counsel tliat was followed here, said
Uonn s. Mil, it is battle it would be. Though thou shouldest
squander thy powers, said the druids of the Tuatha De Danann ; thou shouldst not return to Ireland. Thereafter they came southward from Temair and reached Inber Fele and Inber Scene, where their ships were. They went out over nine waves. The druids and poets of Ireland sang spells against them, till what was at the bottom of the sea was raised to the surface, £0 great was the storm against them, till they arrived far to
the West of Ireland, and were weary upon the sea, A wind of wizards is this, said Donn s. Mil. It is, said Amorgen, unless it be above the sail. The youngest of the family, firannan, went up the mast, and fell upon the rocks or about the boards
of the ship, so that his members were scattered. As he was
falling, he said. It is not over the sail. He was the steei-sman of the ship of Donn, and the fosterling of Amorgen. This is
a disgrace for our men of craft, said Donn, when they had assembled into one place, that they abate not the wizardry. No disgrace is it, said Amorgen ; and he rose up and said the
following
Poem no. LXXII.
There was a calming of the wind upon them immediately.
442. Said Donn : I shall put under the edge of spear and of sword all that are now in Ireland, only let land be reached. The wind made a discrimination against the ship wherein were Donn the king and Airech, two of the Sons of Mil, and the
ship wherein were Bres and Biias and Buaigne, till they were
drowned at the Sandhills, which are called Tighi Duinn ; the grave mound of every man is there. This was their tally,
twenty-four men, and twelve women, and four hirelings, and

who freed them, and Belshazzar who imprisoned them. For Belshazzar was the last prince of the Chaldeans, and Cyrus the first king of the Persians. If it be according to the

There were six chieftains in the South at the last, and otlier six in the North; and the kingdom of the South was given to
Eber, and that in the North to Erimon. Also the two men of cunning, a poet and a harper : Eir and Cinenn were their

(a) This is the apparent sense of the words of the concluding lines, but we can
only conjecture that they refer to spells for the healing of poisoned wounds, and for
securing favourable winds—both of which become necessities in the course of the
Milesian invasion (see HH 416, 490). Lines 11, 12, contain ingenious plays on words,
which cannot be reproduced in translation.

abandoned the time-devouring and probably hopeless task of reducing to order the countless variants in the extant MSS. of this mnemonic rhythm; the chaos is doubtless dne to its having been transmitted orally and carelessly. If a critical edition be worth the labour involved, it must fonn the subject
of a special study. Meanwhile, if any justification for these

INTRODUCTION. 137
SECTION IX.
REIM RIGRAIDE.
The " Roll of the Kings " seems to have originally been a
separate compilation, independent of the L.G. History; which, though afterwards attached to it, was never completely incor
porated. The opening paragraphs, relating to Erimon, are collectively of considerable length, not so much because of his
especial importance, as the founder of the " Milesian " monarchy, as because officious scribes could not leave them alone, and
crammed them with interpolations. In the present edition these have been detached and printed by themselves, so that it is possible once more to read continuously sentences which their intrusion dismembered. But to make the composite nature of the text perfectly clear, it would be necessary to follow the model of the
" Polychrome Bible ", and to print it upon a background of many
colours. No part of the compilation is more instructive for the history of its evolution than this ; it is well therefore, to devote
special attention to its analysis.
The opening sentence tells us that the original compiler stopped his work at the reign of Tuathal Techtmar; and a mere glance
at the text, as it appears in L, appraising the contrast in aspect between the records before and after that monarch, is enough to assure us of this.^ Actually, even before the time of L, the list had already been extended to the end of the record of the Christian
1 Very full particulars, with poems, are given about the kings down to
Tuathal ; but after him all is hurried, and the record degenerates into a mere
catalogue. After the official beginning of Christianity in the country, dates are added in L, doubtless borrowed from some annalistic compilation. The crucial importance of Tuathal Techtmar, as marking the beginning of a new era, is emphasized in Prof. O'Rahilly's recently published Early Irish History
and Mythology. Following his guidance, we can almost see the genealogies being artificially adapted, to further the interests of the foreign invasion which Gaelicized Ireland, and whose leadership is omboui:'d in the legendary Tuathal.
L-G.—VOL. V. ti



138 SECTION IX.
kings; but no corresponding change had been made in the heading
to the Section. F marks an intermediate stage; there the heading
indicates an extension to the time of Dathi, the last of the PreChristian kings; we cannot say whether this version went any
further, for the F list ends abruptly at Eochaid Uaircheas, when
75 kings, not counting " kings in joint sovereignty ", had still to pass by before Dathi should come on the scene. As there is a considerable expanse of blank parchment on the page after the record of this king, the absence of the remainder is not due to a mutilation of the MS. before us; it must have been copied from an older MS. which had lost its final leaves. *Q must have been similarly unfinished, for when the scribe of M, or of one of its
ancestors, appropriated the version of the Roll in *Q, he was obliged to eke it out, after Tuathal Techtmar, by cop;ying a large part of the Borama story; this by enumerating all the lungs who reigned during the exaction of that tribute, offered to him a makeshift fist of kings which to that extent filled in the lacunae
of his exemplar. Similarly, the Min versions of the Roll introduce us to a stage in the development in which the list ended with
Sirna Soegalach, fifty-five kings before Tuathal Techtmar—being afterwards completed with a synopsis borrowed from the Book
of Ballymote (or some closely cognate text, now no longer extant). This extension is not found in /xA, which ends at the place
indicated; in /xV the supplementary matter seems to be in a different script from the rest of that MS. Even the complete form of the Roll has come down to us in
two recensions—that common to R^, R^ and Min on the one hand, and that appended to the R^ MSS. on the other. Compared with
the first of these, the second is summary and very imperfect; obviously the Min text was superadded to the last-named group to supplement the deficiencies of their version of the Roll.
Though Min was originally an independent text, it has now no formal heading, but follows on immediately after ^ 468, with
its three sychronisms {David, Tenes, and Darcellus) to which a fourth (Assyrians) was added, borrowed from R^ (with Assyrii written by mistake for imperii). The words Tuathe .... dorochair amh must also have been intrusive; they are absent from F, which
tells us no more than " There fell Mac Cecht," etc. Over this



INTRODUCTION. 139
i
bald statement, in an ancestral MS., the words tri rig (wTitten rpi^) had been interlined, and were taken into the text, before the word ann in * Q (see ^ 481) and after it in L. This must have been still in the form of a minute and scarcely legible interlineation in the exemplar before the scribe of F, for he took the initial c for c,
and the final -^ for /, {us), and guessed the whole to be cetus. ^ 471 is an interpolation, irrelevant to the main subject, and
only superficially connected with the immediate context. A
shorter form appears in IVIin (^469) in a different associationIt is absent from LR^ but present in F; and as it is in R^ in practi
cally identical words, it must have been in * Q. Passing over ^470, an intrusion in F, we come to ^471, the
kernel of which originally completed the prefatory matter begun in ^469. Comparison of all the versions (including * Q at ^ 486) shews that the two paragraphs 469. 471 were originally no more
than this
Incipit . . . Tuathail Techtmair. Incipit ... of Tuathal Techtmar.
[Sj-nchronism ^^^lth Da^-id.] Ferthar [The Gaedil came into Ireland in cath i Tailtin etir Maccu Miled the time of Da\'id.] A battle was ocus T.D.D., CO torchratar and Mac fought between them and the

i nAirgetros, i ttorchair Eber. a battle was fought between fiber
and firimon in Airget Eos, where
fiber fell.
This is just sufficient to shew that the IVIilesian kings («> claimed
to reign by right of conquest, and that all their rivals were cleared
out of the way by Erimon. The interpolators have prefixed a
list of fortresses, which anticipates—and disagrees with—the
original list in ^ 473 ; glossators have also amplified the note of
time by specifying the Battle of Tailtiu—a necessity, after the
intrusion of 1[ 470 had cut the iar sen, at the beginning of ^ 472, away from its antecedent; and others, attracted by the version in
F, have amplified the story of Eber's death. *Q (at ^ 484) is

140 SECTION IX.
here especially instructive; it shews us the story in its original bald statement, with two alternative versions, clearly interpolated.
F, in ^[471, has combined these, by cutting out the conjunction no, but they still remain at least partly independent. LMin have completed their fusion into one continuous story.
^ 472. What had gone before was virtually the " title-page
and preface " to the original " Roll of the Kings ". This paragraph is the actual beginning of the book. It tells us of forts dug by Erimon on becoming king, and of his establishment of the provincial
kingships. The king appointed over S. Laigin was Crimthann Sciathbel: an interpolator inserted here an irrelevant story about the connexion of this personage with the Cruithne or Picts, ^j 490. Removing which, we find the natural sequel to T[ 472 in our next
paragraph, ^473. This is a mere list of forts and of river- and
lake-bursts in the time of Erimon, in the catalogue form
characteristic of the whole compilation. \ 474 presents us with
a further example of the " catalogue " narrative, in a bald list
of battles fought by the Sons of Mil in the time of Erimon—no
one being left to fight with, they fought among themselves. We strongly suspect that these Milesian chieftains are double per
sonalities; the combat of Erimon against Amorgen at Bile Tened,
the " Tree of Fire ", is to all appearance a doublet of that between
Erimon and Eber at Airget Eos, the " Silver Wood "; in both events, the battle goes against the opponent of Erimon. With the death and burial of Erimon in ^476 the original part of the Erimon pericope of the Roll comes to an end; and we can now see that, before it was farced with scribal interpolations, it differed in no respect from the entries relating to the later kings. These conform
to a stereotyped pattern: Accession; certain Stock Incidents (Forts
built. Plains cleared. Battles); and Manner of Death. Much even of this jejune material is omitted by Min, not because it was absent from the archetype of that version, but because it was already included in R^, to which Min, as we have it, was adapted
as an augmentation, so that its repetition would have been a
superfluous waste of scribal labour and WTiting-materials. In passing, it may be suggested that the apparently exaggerated emphasis laid upon lake-bursts throughout the compilation may have been a consequence of a special characteristic of the Physical



INTRODUCTION. 141
Geography of the country—the temporary lakes commonly called turlochs, normall}^ drained by subterranean watercourses in the
underlying Limestone, but often swelled to formidable dimensions, if the channel should happen to become blocked.^ The Second Redaction begins at ^ 476. It differs entirely
from Ri = R3, though it narrates much the same sequence of events; and it is more closely united with the body of L.G. than the other redactions. It seems indeed to have been made an
intrinsic part of that version of the compilation from the first.
It is much briefer, reducing most of the history to the merest abstract. Comparison of the two versions reveals the following
differences in detail:
Forts. Dun Binne becomes Diin Aird Finne (^ 431) and Dun Cermna, Raith Sailech, and Raith Croich disappear. Raith Aird Suird (^ 482) is added.
Establishment of Pentarchs. Ignored in R2.
River-bursts. The '" Seven Riges " and the '" Seven Brosnas " have become
nine apiece, and the "' Three Uinnsinns " are added. The '" Three Sues " and
" Ethne " were probably not in the original text of R^, but have been added
at haphazard, as has also been the previously unrecorded burst of " Fregabail " (H 478, 479).
Lake-hursts. " Loch Baga " has been added to R^ (^ 478) ; the inter
polator has overlooked the consequent necessity of changing the number
" eight " to " nine " at the head of the list. A contrary " correction " to
"seven" will be found in M (]| 487, at reference -number (i*) ).
Battles. From R2 we learn of the death of Sol^airche at Airget Ros ; he is not among the casualties recorded in any text of Ri, where Setga takes
his place. In R2 we hear for the first time of battles at Ciil Caichir (where
Caicher feU), and Breogan, where Fulman and Mantan perished. Un is added to the list of casulaties in the Battle of Comraire.
Chronology. Ri assigns a reign of 17 years to Erimon (18 in ;xR) ; but R2 allows him 15 years only, including the year spent in joint sovereignty with Eber. The compiler of R^ seems to have set out with the intention of
putting his material into an annalistic forna; there are several " notes of time "
scattered through these few paragraphs. At the end, he gives us a sjoichronism with Alexander and the Diadochi, obviously incompatible with the three mutually contradictory synchronisms at the beginning of Ri.
1 I have myself been obliged to take a long detotir, while driving through
Co. Galway with a friend—a local resident, well acquainted with the district

owTaing to a sudden encounter with a considerable lake which had not been there when my friend passed over the same gro\md, not very long before.



142 SECTION IX.
Interpolations. The two MSS., D and E, are notably free from the interpolations which in all the other MSS. have so disordered the Erimon pericope. These MSS., especially E, get us as near as possible to the archetype of R^. It is likely that the interpolations were also absent from the closely related
MS. R, but this must remain conjectural, as R is here defective. On the other
hand, V and A are almost as full of interpolations as the R^ MSS.
The third redaction begins at ^ 480. The opening paragraphs,
480 and 481, correspond to R^ ^469, 470, and come from * Q.
The next two, 482, 483, set forth the divisions of Ireland—not
the pentarchic divisions—and the fortresses. The same material,
but in a different text, appears in R^R^, beginning, respectively, at Tf 400, 425. In ^ 484, however, B (not M) adopts the matter interpolated at the beginning of 471. The latter part of ^472,
in the version of * Q—an older form than F—appears in ^ 486. In ^ 485 we find the story of Tea in a form different from any appearing elsewhere in the book. ^ 486 begins in B with the text of *[| 472, taken from * Q; the estimate of 15 years' of Erimon's reign, including the one year shared with Eber, is borrowed from R^ (^477). The remainder of 477 is appended to the paragraph before us, and is broken into
by a later interpolation. This composite paragraph, interpolation and all, must have entered the text before the separation of the
B and M traditions. The M tradition, as is its wont, has partly
rewritten and expanded the material, but it is fundamentally the same as B. -y/MB, the ancestral MS., must have borrowed
this material from a MS. of R^, intermediate between DE (which
do not possess the interpolation at all) and V "^ (which have it in full) : for the words in tres hliadain hi Femen la hErimon (end of
1[ 477 in R2, 487 in R^) appear before the long interpolation in R2 and after it in R^. The only reasonable inference is that these words were intrusive, written at the top of a page Avhich was
occupied with the material of Interpolation A and its sub
interpolations. It was meant to precede this material; but the R^ copyist, having taken in what he wanted, came to the top of
the page again, observed the note, and copied it also. For this reason it has been marked as glossarial in % 477, as printed below. ^ 487 begins with the intrusive passage just mentioned. After
this, B follows *Q, ^ 505; M, recognizing that the material has already been set forth, gives only a brief abstract. Where the



INTRODUCTION. 143
two MSS. converge again, there has evidently been conscious
editing. The River-bursts are ignored—or, rather, the R^ version
is preferred, ^478: Ethne and the Three Sues are promoted to
full status from their precarious glossarial position in R^; evidently they were still marginal notes in the MS. of R^ used by the editor
of R^. The Lake-bursts are listed as in R^, not as in R^. A synchronistic note (" death of Hercules ") makes its contribution to
the chronological confusion. ^ 489. The death of Erimon, where R^ still follows R^. Were it not that the long Interpolation E, which follows ^ 473 in F,
is also in R^, and, therefore, was presumably in * Q, we might be tempted to infer that * Q was here mutilated, forcing the compiler of R^ to follow^ R^ as his authority at this place; but in ^ 490 he returns to his allegiance to *Q. This attempt to determine the relationship between the extant MSS. and versions at least brings into prominence the great number of copies of this text that must have been in existence in the
days of Irish literary activity—as indeed we might a priori have expected, seeing that it was universally adopted as the standard
history of the country and its people. Every monastic hbrary of importance must have possessed at least one copy.
THE PICTISH INTERPOLATIONS.
These elements in the text, as it has been transmitted to us, are culled from a Chronicle of the Picts, fragments of which are
scattered not only through this document, but through others
as well—as, for example, the Irish version of the History of Nennius. They have been collected by Skene ^, and the texts
which he has brought together must be taken into consideration
in criticizing the paragraphs before us. Interpolation A. According to the version of the Story of Ard Lemnachta in R^, the milk-trick was not an antidote to the poisoned weapons of the Tuath Fidga, but a means of destroying them; the milk of the sacred cattle was a poison for the foreign
enemies. We may remove unde Cath Arda Lemnachta from this
1 Chronicles of the Picts and Scots, Edinburgh, 1867.



144 SECTION IX.
early text as a gloss, as is suggested by the Latin tag introducing
it. Min has discovered the name of the Pictish " druid ", which
was unknown to LF. We mark the " poisoned irons " of the Tuath Fidga as likewise glossarial ; they are unknown to Min. The alternative story, in which the milk is an antidote, also
appears in /xR, at the end of the passage here printed as Interpolation B. The writer of /xR has cut it down to some extent, as he had already A\Titten out the story in its other form. In jitR
this is an independent section, having the loosest possible connexion \yith the context, and it follows the Ard Lemnachta story.
In the R'^R^ versions it is interjected into—we cannot say in
corporated with—the text, before the Ard Lemnachta stor3\ Consequently the two versions of the narrative have come into
collision, and the editors of the later redactions have endeavoured,
without conspicuous success, to combine them into a single
narrative. The continuation, ^^ 493, 495, displays the Cruithne
profiting from their assistance to the Gaedil, increasing in power, and becoming a source of magical knowledge and practice. Something seems to have gone wrong with the list of officials of the Cruithne in the middle of ^ 493. As it stands it runs thus,
omitting punctuation-marks
Da mac Cathluain .i. Catano- Two sons of Cathluan, i.e. lodar 1 Catanalachan a da Catanolodar and Catanalaehan, curaid Imm mac Pirrn -j Cing their two champions Imm son athair Cruithne a da sruth of Pirn and Cing father of
[.i.] Crus "1 Ciric a da mlled Cruithne their two sages (i.e.) hUaisnem a file [i] Cruithne Crus and Ciric their two
a cerd. soldiers Uaisnem their poet (and) Cruithne their wright.
Working backward from the end, if we separate " Uaisnem the
poet " and "Cruithne the wright" from the preceding a da miled,
the " two soldiers " must be Crus and Ciric. If so, the preceding
"A.", Avhich we hav^e bracketed, must be struck out. Imm and
Cing would then be the " two sages ", and the two polysyllabic
sons of Cathluan the " two champions ". But in the MSS. these
two names are separated, perhaps in error, from the following a da curaid by a stop. If we accept the stop, then Catanolodar



LNTRODUCTION. 145
and his brother are undistinguished except as sons of Cathluan;
the champions are Imm and Cing, the sages Crus and Ciric; in which case the ".i." must stand. Either the poet and the wright double the parts of the soldiers, or two names have dropped out after milid. Another version, printed by Skene, deletes a da sruth and makes Crus son of Cing, and the single soldier of the
Cruithne; in no text do the postulated missing names appear. The original completion of the passage is in the )u,R version, also
given by Skene (but from a different source, elsewhere in B and
M). The passage which ousts it in R^R^ is a late interpolation,
which pre-supposes some form of Interpolation C.
Interpolation B. This precedes Interpolation A in the
passage as printed by Skene (loc. cit.). That some learned glossator
should identify the Picts with the Agathyrsi was inevitable, in view of Vergil's Picti Agathyrsi {Aen. iv 146) taken in connexion
with the Pictos Gelonos of Georg. ii 115. The latter indentification,
expressed by the genealogical statement clanda Geloin meic Ercoil,
is probably the earlier; the insertion of the Agathyrsi, unknown
to R^, being presumably due to someone who was unaware, or had forgotten, that Agathyrsus and Gelonos were two different
sons of Hercules, so that their descendants, though cognate,
should not have been identified.
Interpolation C is an aetiological mjrth, designed to explain the matriarchal basis of Pictish society, while at the same time
claiming for the Gaedil an ancestral hold over Pictland—giving to the Dalriadic colonists a title to the region of Scotland which
they had occupied and Gaelicized. The story assumed different forms in the course of transmission, and attached itself to different Pictish envoys. This paragraph contains three versions ; others
will be found in 11^493, 499. Interpolation D. This catalogue of Pictish kings is an excerpt from the Pictish Chronicle, edited from a Paris MS. by Skene
{op. cit. p. 3 ff.). The form in which it has reached our scribes is
an interesting example of progressive corruption. The relevant
part of our text, as printed by Skene, runs thusCruidne filius Cinge, pater Pictorum habitantium in hac insula, C annis
regnauit. VII filios habuit ; haec sunt nomina eorum—Fib, Fidach, Floclaid,
Fortrenn, Got, Ce, Circinn. Circin[n] LX [annis] regnauit. Fidaich (sic) XL.
Fortrenn LXX. Floclaid XXX. Got XII. Ce XV. Fibaid {sic) XXIIII



146 SECTION IX.
It will be seen that in our text the bare list of the sons of
Cruidne is repeated, with the regnal years attributed to each; but in the Scottish list the order is disturbed: Fib, who heads
the list of sons, becomes Fibaid, at the end of the List of kings;
while Circinn, at the tail of the list of sons, is promoted to the
headship of the Hst of kings. For the rest, Fidaich retains his
second place in both lists, but the remaining four fall into pairs,
Flocaid—Fortrenn, Got—Ce, who are severally transposed. These changes do not affect the Irish list. Here, though Floclaid (in
the form " Fotla ") is enumerated among the sons, he has dropped
out of the king-list, and the thirty regnal years attributed to him
are used for augmenting the reigns of Ciric {sic, not " Circenn " as in the Scottish list), and of Got, by 20 and 10 years respectively.
Ce has 15 years in the one list, 12 in the other—by the frequent
confusion of the Roman numerals .xu. and .xii. After the sons
of Cruidne, the Scottish list gives us
Gede Ollgudach LXXX years Denbecan C years

^reason will presently be shewn for believing that these should
be transposed. They are followed by
Guidid Gaed Brechach L years
Gest Gurcich XL years
Wurgest XXX years.
Another king Gest, with a reign of one year, has certainly dropped out between the first two of these. The proof of this Avill be given in a moment ; but for the meanwhile we may point out how easily
such a king would disappear in this context; for " Gest .i."
( = " Gest one [year] "
) would almost certainly be understood to mean Gest id est, and would be passed over as superfluous before
the presumably elucidatory " Gest Gurcich " who follows. Gest
Gurcich is probably an early interpolation between (the original)
Gest and Wurgest, who make a pair analogous to the " Brude " doublets, which now begin. In due course we shall see that the
foregoing group of kings, six in all, interposed between the Sons



INTRODUCTION. 147
of Cruidne and the Brudes, is actually an Irish dynasty of considerable mythological importance, which the Pictish Chronicler
has borrowed and adapted for his own purposes.
The List of the Brudes begins with these words
Brude Bont [aliter Pant] a quo XXX Brude regnauerunt Hiberniam et
Albaniam per CL annorum spacium, XLVII annis regnauit, id est Brude Pant, Brude Ur-Pant ...
and so on, through a list of similar pairs, similarly constructed,
and all distinguished by the presumably Pictish title Brude, whatever it may mean. The list contains only 28 names, although
30 are specified in the heading; fortunately the Irish list enables us to restore the missing two, although it has itself been further reduced to 16 names. In one part of the list we have the following
couples
Pictish List. Irish List,
Brude Fet - Brude Ur-Fet Bruigi Fet - Bruigi Ur-Fet
Brude Ru - Brude E-Ru Bruigi Ruaile - Bruigi E-ro
Brude Gart - Brude Ur-Gart Bruigi Gart - Bruigi Ar-Gart
" Ruaile " means Rii aile, " Ru the Second "; we infer that
there must have been originally two couplets " [Brude Ru] Brude E-Ru : Brude Ru aile, -[Brude E-ru aile] "; and that the second pair dropped out completely from the Pictish list, while the names here bracketed disappeared from the Irish list. Similar errors appear in the version used by the Irish translator of Nennius
(ed. Van Hamel, p. 82), in which, besides minor orthographical
variants, we find the further errors of omitting " Brude Ur-Gart ",
and extending the list of Brudes into a subsequent dynasty of kings of Alba, which does not concern us here.
We now proceed to trace the evolution of the Irish list from the Pictish list. In the tradition which ended in the Irish list. Fib was retained as the first king; not merely as the eldest of
seven brothers of whom the seventh headed the king-fist; and an
Irish gloss was appended to Brude Pont—is de atberta Bruige
fria gachfer fib. A gloss to the same effect, but differently worded, appears in the Nennius version.



148 SECTION IX.
The copyist chiefly responsible for the corruptions in the Irish list must have arranged the names in a series of four columns,
thus
VII filios habuit Fortrenn Got Ce Got XII (XXII)
Ce XV (XII)
Ciric LX (LXXX) Denbeean C (V)
Gede Olgudach LXX (XXX)
Olfinechta LX Guidid gaed brechach L(I) Gest I Gest Gurcich XL
Wurgest XXX Brude Pont
haec sunt nomina eorum Fib Fidach Floclaid Circinn Fib XXIIII annis regnauit [Albaniam
a quo XXX B. XLVIII regnauit [[per CCL annos B.



INTRODUCTION. 149
totted up the (corrupted) regnal years of the Sons of Cruidne (but retaining 15 instead of 12 for Ce, shewing that this is a later
scribe's error—which indeed does not appear in all the MSS.,
M, for example, having the number .xu. correctly). He found
that they amounted to 251, and so altered the CL of the note
—which really enumerated the regnal years of the Brudes—to CCL, which is entered in the list above the name of Brude Eru
aile.
III. The note, in Irish, about " Brude Pont " being the source
of the Brudes, was inserted at the head of col. iii, again separated
from the person to whom it properly belongs. It actually follows Brude Ureal, the last king of col. ii: the last word, moreover^ "Albaniam", has been detached, and fitted into the blank space at the end of the second of the long lines above the columns, in continuous line with the details about Fib. It has thus become
incongruously incorporated with these, so that we have " Fib
.xxiiii. bl. i r-rige n-Alban ". In addition to these misunderstandings,
" a quo XXX B." = " from whom are the 30 Brudes " was understood to mean that Brude Pont reigned 30 years. The actual
statement of his regnal years which follows, ".xlviii. regnauit "
was misread as " Ulaid regnauit " and understood to mean that the Brudes, or at least Brude Pont, reigned in Ulidia. But this note must have been in two places in two different MSS., producing two corruptions which the glossators accumulated: first after
the statement of the partition of Scotland above " Fib ", and secondly where we have printed it, at the head of col. iii. Here
" regnau. Hib." must be the source for the meaningless " 7 remna
na fir " with which the text presents us at this point.
IV. The next error was to mistake the column of B's—the
initial of " Brude " —for abbreviations of bliadna, and to Hnk
them to the numbers of the regnal years in col. i. This extinguished
the first eleven Brudes as such; and as each " B " was written
close up against the name to which it belonged, it brought that
name into illegitimate alliance with the name with which the
regnal years were associated. For example, " Got XXII
B. Urpont " was read across the two columns, as " Got XXII b. Urpont ", and understood to mean that Got, also called Urpont,



150 SECTION IX.
reigned 22 years (otherwise 12 years). This led further to a transposition and fusion of the two names. The transposition is perhaps due to the fact that it is a slightly less mental strain to
turn " Got xxii bl. Urpont " to " Urpont Got xxii bl." than
to " Got Urpont xxii bl." : the one involves transposition only, the other transposition plus disturbance of a collocation already
established. However that may be, the transposition took place, and the associated names became regrouped and fused together,
with this result
Got Ce
Ciric Denbecan
Gede Olgudach Olfinachta [chach Guidid Gaed BreGest
Gest Gurcich
Wurgest Brude Pont
-f Urpont + Leo + Urleo + Gant
+ Urgant + Gnith

Urpontcait Urleoce
Uileo Ciric Grant Aenbecan
Urgantcait Gnithfinnachta Burgnith Guidid Gadbre. Feth .i. Ges
Urfecthair Gest Guirid
Cal Urgest Ureal Bruite Pont
This list affords the evidence for the transposition of Denbecan
and Gede, and the insertion of Gest, already indicated. The one year of Gest has become the abbreviation of id est, as has also been
mentioned. The end of the long name of Guidid was stowed away in a cor fa chdsan and overlooked, perhaps under the influence of the similar termination of his predecessor's name. The original
fifty years of this king having dwindled to one, by a misreading of the numerical sign .1. as b, the initial of bliadan, the copyist
had a superfluous B on his hands, which he misinterpreted as the
initial of the king's " secondary " name; this, therefore, appears
in the list as " Burgnith "..
Regnal years were set out in the flrst column, but not in the
others —an indication that the list is an artificial combination of two lists, one of which had regnal years while the other had not;
so there was here no influence to filch away the prefixed " B " from Cint and his successors. The alterations in the regnal years.



INTRODUCTION. 151
to which reference has already been made, are slight, and involve
only the easiest of corruptions—the artificial augmentation in the allowance to Got and to Ciric, and the changes of Ce's .xu. to
•xii. and of Guidid's .1. to .i. or to " b ". Denbecan's .c. was perhaps regarded as an abbreviation for coic (5) and so turned
into .u., by a copyist Avho felt pardonably doubtful about a reign of a hundred years.
With these preliminary remarks we may now proceed to the
text of the Roll of the Kings. A few special points may call here and there for footnotes.

them concerning the three ridges that were best in
Ireland at that time, namely Druim Clasaig in Ui Maine,

Mumu. They fought a battle between them upon Tenus
in Ui Failge, on the brink of Bri Dam at Tochar-etir
da-mag, and the battle broke against fiber; also Suirge and Sobairce and Gosten fell there. JJnde Tanaide
the learned dixit
Poem no. LXXXVL
477. Thereafter firimon took the kingship of Ireland
to the end of fifteen years; but fiber was king for a year of that reckoning. In his time were done the follomng deeds : the battle of Cul Caichir at the end
of a year from the slaying of fiber—it is there that Caicher fell, at the hands of Amorgen Gluingel.
At the end of a year after that, Amorgen fell in the
battle of Bile Tened in the recesses of Breg, at the hands of firimon s. Mil; and the nine Brosnas of fiile, the three Uinnsinns of Ui Ailella, and the nine Riges

of the world came the Gaedil to Ireland, that is, in the
time of David son of Joseph (sic) by whom the Temple
of Solomon was projected, and after nine years of the
princedom imperii regis Assy riorum. On Thursday, as regards the daj^ of the week, the seventeenth of the moon, the kalends of May [in that] solar month, the battle of

three Idngs fell there—Mac Cecht at the hands of firimon,
Mac Cuill of Eber, Mac Grene of Amorgen, £riu of Suirge, Banba of Caicher, Fotla of Etan. 481. Thereafter the two sons of Mil cast lots npon
their artists, a poet and a harper; Cir s. Is was the
poet, and Onnoi the harper. To Eber fell the harper, so that from the South there ever cometh tunefulness of music; but to Erimon fell the poet, so that from the
North are master-arts from that out. Whereof the
historian chanted this song

485. In the year before the setting of that battle by
the two Sons of Mil, Tea the daughter of Lugaid mac
Itha died—the wife of £rini6n son of Mil of Spain. She had sureties against her husband, namely Amorgen
Gluingel and fiber, before they came into Ireland, that whatsover land she should choose, therein should she be buried, and her rampart and her lair dug; and that
therein there should be every royal dignity and every assembly that should be convened, of the progeny of
£rim6n, for ever. This is the mound which ,she chose,
Liath-druim ; because it was the fairest sod by far Avhich
she saw in Ireland. And therein was the dignity of Ireland; and from her is it named, Temair, from her
being therein habitually. And she w^as buried after
wards, and her rampart was raised over her, namely,
Mur Tea, Tea-Mur.

called AgathjTsi . . . There were six chieftains [who came to Ireland],
namely six brethren, Solen, Ulpa, Nechtan, Drostan, Oengus, Lethend.
The cause of their coming was, that Policornus king of Thrace gave love
to their sister, and sought to carry her off without a bride-price.(^)
They went afterwards over Roman territory to Frankish territory, and
founded a city there, called Poitiers; derived from pictis, from their tatu-marks. Then the king of the Franks gave love to their sister. They
went forth on the sea, after the death of their sixth brother, Lethenn. At the end of two days after setting forth on sea, their sister died.
494. The Cruithne landed in Inber Slaine, and Crimthann made them welcome, for dri\'ing out the Tuath Fidga, and they fought there the

them in a consequential tangle), is here rectified.
ib) It would be idle to seek for any historical basis for this story. Possibly
"Policornus king of Thrace" is a transformation of [Demetrius] Toliorcetes king

and the poison would do them no hurt. The Tiiath Fidga were slain there, and four of the Cruithne were slain likewise, Drostan, Solen,
Nechtan, and Ulpa. They acquired power, etc. £rim6n drave them out,
etc. They came afterwards to Ireland to seek wives, namely the wives of Bres and of Buas. —C
495. It is then that Cruithnechan son of Cing came to seek wives
of Erimon; and firimon
gave him the wives of
the men who were drowned at the Sand
hills, namely Bres and
Buas and Buaigne; and
the surety of sun and
of moon against them
that land should be
taken [i.e. inherited]
no less from men among the Cruithne
folk than from women for ever, (a)
And they made peace
afterwards, and £ri
mon gave them the
wives of the men who were drowned along with Bonn, that is, the wives of Bres, Buas,
and Buaigne ; and
sureties of sun and of moon that not less
would kingship and
domain be taken from women, than from men. among the Cruithne folk for ever.
And they made peace
afterwards. Or it is out of the sons of Mil themselves that Cruithnechan son of Ing (sic)
went with the Britons of Fortrenn to fight
against the Saxons,
and his children and his
sword-land appertained to them, that is the
Cruithne folk. For they
had no wives, because
the women of Aiba had died of diseases. So they went back to tlie
Sons of Mil, and they
took heaven and earth,
sun and moon, sea and
land [as sureties], that
princedom over them
should come of women for ever. And he [firi
mon] gave them twelve
superfluous women that
the expedition of the
Sons of Mil had in Ireland, for their husbands had been drowned in the Western Sea along with Donn. So that princedom over the Cruithne - folk comes ever from the Men of Ireland, after the company of the
wife of Bres, [and the
wives] of Buaigne and
of Buas, and of all the
chieftains who were drowned.
(a) Sic. The sense intended is evidently the converse— "no less from women
. than from men " —as in the adjacent column.

clear from the story, that when 1th son of Breogan came into Ireland
and had colloquy with the Tuatha De Danann, it was through Scotic
that he conversed, and they conversed with him; and, furtlier, it was the
Scotic language that served every one of the Takings. In this wise they
unite in one stock : Nemed s. Agnoman s. Pamp s. Tai s. Sru s. Esru
s. Rifath Scot; so that they are all of the progeny of Bifath Scot,
according to that extract, save only Cessair. If they be not of the same
stock, it was through the Grecian tongue that they were wont to converse,
each with the other, for it is Greece which was their origin, and their
native language was Greek. For only the sons of Mil had Gaedilic, and
when they became powerful in Ireland, the Gaedilic advanced in strength^ and weakness fell upon the Greek. Thereof the poet chanted,
Foem no. XCII.
If this be not likely, or if any liketh it not, let him find out knowledge that is better, and we shall receive knowledge of him.
—F
498. Or that it was in that year that Cruithnechan son of Cing son of Loichet went with the Britons of Fortrenn to fight against the Saxons,
and he cut out land for them, namely the Gruithne-folk. And their land
was established, but they had no women, for the women of Alba had died.
So Cruithnechan came back to the Sons of Mil, and gave heaven and earth, sun and moon, sea and land, dew and light, [as pledges] that
princedom over them should be of women for ever. And he (Mil) gave
twelve superfluous women whom the sons of Mil had. Their husbands
had been drowned in the sea westward, along with Donn; and thus
princedom over the Cruithne-folk is of the men of Ireland from that out,
continuously.

R- : Then Tigernmas took the kingship of Ireland, and broke thrice nine battles before the end of a year upon the children of Eber; namely the battles of Eile (in which fell Rochorb son of GoUan), of Commar, of Mag Techt, of Lochmag (in which fell Daigerne son of Goll son of GoUan), of Cul Fraochain, of Cul Athguirt in Seimne, of Ard Niad in Connachta, of Cnamcoill in Connachta, of Carn Feradaig (where fell Feradach son of Rochorb son of Gollan), of Cluain Cuasa in Tethba, of Codnach in Tuath Eba, of Cluain Muirisce south of Breifne, two battles of Cul [sic lege] in Airgetros, and the battle of Cul Fobair on Erbus, and seven battles in Luglochta on Loch Lugdach in one day, and the battle of Reb; it is that which chiefly destroyed the progeny of Eber. In the second year moreover, there were nine lake-bursts over the land of Ireland ; Loch Ce and Loch Ailinne in Connachta, Loch larainn and Loch Uair and Loch Silenn and Loch Gabar in Mide and
in all Brega, Loch Febail in Tir Eogain—over Febal son cf Lodan did it burst forth; and Mag Fuinnsige is the name of the plain over which that lake came; and Dubloch of Ard Ciannachta, and Loch Dabuill in Airgialla.

And it is Tigernmas who was an hundred years in the kingship of Ireland. Then Tigernmas died thereafter, with three-fourths of the men of Ireland in his company, in the great Assembly of Mag Slecht in Breifne.
R^ : Then Tigernmas son of FoILach s. Ethriel s. Iriel Faid, s. Erimon, s. Mil of Spain took the kingship of Ireland there
after; Thineus was in the kingship of the world when
Tigernmas succeeded. A tale of seventy and seven years had he, in the kingship of Ireland. It is he who broke twenty-seven battles, before the end of a year, upon the progeny of fiber; of them were the battles of Eile (where Rochorb son of Gollan s. Conmael s. fiber s. Mil fell), of Comar, Mag Techt, Lochmag
(where Dagerne s. Coll s. Gollan fell), of Cul Ard in Mag Inis,
of Cul Fraechain and of Cul Athguirt in Seimne, of Ard Niad
in Connachta, of Cnamcoill in Connachta, of Cam Feradaig (where Feradach s. Rochorb s. Follach [or Feradach s. Rochorb s. Gollan s. Conmael s. fiber] fell) ; of Cluain Casa in Tethba, of Codnach in Tuaith Eba (in Cairpre Moin of Druini Cliab), of Cluain Muirisce south of Breifne, and of Cul upon Erbus; seven battles of Luglacht upon Loch Lugdach in one day ; two battles of Cul in one day in Airgetros, and the battle of
Reb against the Ema and the Mairthine. Now in that battle the seed of fiber were all destroyed before the end of a year. In the second year, there broke forth nine lake-bursts over the land of Ireland, namely Loch Ce in Connachta, Linn Tola Tuile Tobair (over Aillenn daughter of Romair, so that she was drowned there, and from her is named Loch Aille in Callraige in Coirpre Mor), and Dubloch of Ard Cianachta, and Loch Gabair in the south of Breg; Loch Silenn and Loch Gabar in Brega, and the burst of Daball in Airgialla and [of] Loch
Febal in Tir Eogain—over Febal s. Lotan it burst, in a marine sea-burst, and Mag Foirinnsi was the name of the plain over which the lake came; and Loch lairn. In the time of
Tigernmas, further, was a gold-mine first found in Ireland, and in Foithri of Airther Lifi was it found. By Tigernmas
was a brooch first made, that is, a pin of gold and silver; luchadan was the name of the wright who made it. By
Tigernmas also were first made horns and silver vessels in Ireland. By Tigernmas were purple and blue and green first

put upon garments in Ireland. By Tigernmas were first
made cheekerings upon gamients in Ireland—one colour in the [single] garment of slaves, two colours in the garb of peasants, three in thie garments of hirelings and fighting men, four in those of lordings, five in those of
chieftains, six in those of men of learning, seven in those of kings and of queens; this is what authorizes all the colours at present in the vesture of a bishop and of a poet. It is in the .reign of Tigernmas, further, that Thineus king of the Assyrians died. It is in the reign of Tigernmas, further, that Dercylas king of the Assyrians died. In the reign of Tigernmas, further, was the beginning of the Fourth Age, and the taking of the kingship by David son of lase. This is the length of the Fourth Age of the World, four hundred seventy
and three years—other reckoners say that there were not more than three hundred seventy and three years in it. It is in the .reign of Tigernmas, and in the beginning of the Fourth Age, that Eupales took the kingship of the Assyrians, and the death of David in his time, and Solomon son of David took the kingship in his time. Thereafter Tigenmias son of Follach died, after those many deeds in his reign, in Mag Slecht in
Breifne, in his own great Assembly, with three-fourths of the
men of Ireland along with him. So that thence is "Mag

R^ : Moreover Sobairce and Cermna Finn, the two sons of Ebric of the Ulaid, took the kingship of Ireland. It is in that year that Laosthenes took the kingship of Assyria,. These two were the first kings of Ireland from the Ulaid, and they were forty years in the kingship of Ireland. Ireland was divided between them, from Inber Colptha to Liiimnech, both of them
from their forts, Dun Sobairce and Dun Cermna. [Or perhaps
they were of ''lording" family, as they were two brethren.] Ireland was an hundred years under that division. At th(3 hands of that Cermna fell Eoehu Edgathach in the battle of Temair; Sobairce fell at the hands of Eochu Menn, the first king of the Fomoire ; Cermna Finn fell at the hands of Eochu

He broke four battles against the children of Eber—the battle of the Sea, and the battle of the Swamp, and battle of Sliab Femen and the battle of Sliab Belgadain, where Fiachu
Labrainne fell at the hands of Eochu Mumo son of Mofebis.
W
: Fiachu Labrainne son of SmirgoU s. Enboth s. Tigernmas took the kingship of Ireland in the reign of Piritiades king of the Assyrians. In his reign was the burst of Flesc and jMaine and Labrainn. The year after he took Irelajid, a battle with the Erna and the Mairthine was set by him, and the battle of Sliab Femen and a battle against Ui Cremthainn. And before them went the battle of the Carn into Dal Araide, and the battle of Murdrucht (°) against the Erna and Fir Bolg, and it broke against the Erna; and the slaughter pressed on into Linn Tola Tuile IMoir the night after the burst, for the
battle broke against the Erna before Fiacha Labrainne—we mean the burst of Loch Erne, "the lake over the Erna". In his reigTL died Piritiades king of the Assyrians; in his reign,
moreover, Ofratalus took the kingship of Assyria. Fiachu Labrainne fell in the battle of Sliab Belgadain in lar-Mumu,

Sliab Cailge in the territory' of Corco Baiscinn—against the
Mairthine was it broken—and the battle of Glas Fraechain in which Fraechan Faid fell. Also he broke fifty battles against
the Cimithentuath, and against the Fir Bolg; twelve battles against the Longobardi; and four against the Colosi; the battle of Cuil Ratha in Desmumu against the IVIartra,, and the battle of Carn Richeda against the Martra in addition; the battle of Sliab Cua against the Ema; and the battle of Ard Achaid, in which Smirgoll s. Smethra king of the Fomoire tf'ell. In his time was the burst of Loch Oenbeithe in Ui Cremthainn, and of Loch Sailech, and of Loch Cassan, and the seaburst between Eba and Rosceite in Ui Flachrach. Seven plains were
cleared by him—Mag nOensciath in Laigin, Mag Glinni Dechon in Cenel Conaill, Mag Culi Coel in Cenel Bogaitie, Ailmag in

(a) Sometime in the reign of Eoehu Mumu a change of monarchy took place
in the Assyrian kingdom, overlooked fby our synchronizers. Ofrataeus, the
" Ofratalus " of| the corrupt Colbertine MS., reigned for 20 years, and was followed
by Ofratanes, king for 50 years. The similarity of these names has hidden the
demise of the Assyrian crown from the compilers of our record. As Oengus reigned
for 18 years and Enna for 27, a total of 45', the SO years of Ofratanes must have
begun in the reign of Eoehu Mumu.

But it is disheartening to linger over all this recital, without knowing who preserv^ed this history. The answer is,, that there were patriarchs with very long lives, whofin God detained to tell tidings of every generation to the Flood, and to the time of Cessair, and ^rom Cessair to the Faith, and to the time of
Fintan. And Fintan s. Labraid, qui dicitur s. Bochra, pre
served it—he who was a year under the Flood, and who survived in every age till the coming of the Saints. And it is said that he was Tuan mac Cairill s. Muiredach Muinderg
of the Ulaid afterwards, and [God] preserved him till the time of Patrick and of Colum Cille and of Coimgall and of Findian; so that he wrote in upon their knees and thighs and palms,
so that it Is corrected in the keeping otf sages and righteous
men aud men of learning and historians, and is upon the altars
of saints and righteous men from that day to this; so that the authors of all knowledge stitched it together down to this.
Thereof did the historian chant as follows
Poem no. LXV. [Part iv, page 252*, of this edition.]
A synchronism of the kings of Ireland with the kings of the whole World.
Srimon took the kingship in the same year that Alexander took the high-kingship of the world, and slew Darius the Great s. Arsabes, at the end of five years. Thereafter Alexander died, and his chieftains took the World after him for forty years. Ten years after the death of Alexander, £rim6n died.
Eight years thereafter, Mmmne, Luigne, and LcUgne. Ten years thereafter to itiel s. £rim6n.
In the twelfth year of the reign of Ethriel s. Iriel Faid s. firimon, the last chieftain of the people of Alexander died, Ptolomaeus s. Airge.

by the contemporary " Coenus king of Macedon " may have supposed that the name

first syllable of the name; a copyist misunderstood the correction, and took it to
be an omitted syllable supplied. The changing of " sarmus " to " fainus " would be quite easy in the Irish script.

Niiadu Finn Fail s. Giallchad s. Ailill Olchain took the kingship of Ireland. Scholars reckon that Eochaid Apthach of the seed of Eber took it, and by him were made silver or brazen shields for the Gaedil. So Nuadu fell at the hands of Bres Ri s. Art Imlech. And though scholars reckon Eochaid Apthach as before Nuadu, it is after Bres that he comes, after a long time, as it is said.
XXXIII.—BRES.
531. R^ : Bres took the kingsJiip [nine years], and broke many battles against the Fomoire, till he died in Carn Conluain.
• R'^ : Bres Ri s. Art Imlech took the kingship of Ireland in the reign of Nabuehodonosor king of the Persians; and Cambyses s. Cyrus was king at the same time as Bres. Cyaxares
king of the Medes had thirty-two years, and in the tenth year of his reign Nabcadon went from Babylon; in his time the Temple of Solomon was burnt. Here is an extract from
another scholar—that Astyages took the kingdom of the Medes and that his reign was contemporary with that of Nabcadon, the first king of the Chaldeans; and sages of learning reckon
that it was Nuadu Finn Fail who then was over Ireland, when Nabcadon took the kingship. But if that be true, Bres comes after us [i.e. after the point in history which we have reached]. Moreover, Cyrus son of Darius, the first king of the Persians, he it is who is called "Nabcadon Cirius" the last king of the Chaldeans. He took the Captivity from Babylon and Nuadu Finn Fail was king of Ireland lat the time. If that extract
be true, it is there that the Fourth Age of the World breaks off, namely from David to the Babylonian Captivity, its lengtli in years being 473, and Bres, according to that extract, being
"after us" and the beginning of the Fifth Age, and Eochu Opthach "after us", after Bres. Thereafter Bres took the
kingship after Nuadu Finn Fail and broke many battles against the Fomoire, till he fell in Carn Conluain.

551. R= bis: Now Oengus Olmuccaid fell in the battle of Carman at
the hands of £nna Airgdech s. Eochu Mumo; by him were silver shields
made in Argatros, and he gave them to the men of Ireland. He took the kingship of Ireland thereafter, till he fell in the battle of Raigne at
tlie hands of Rotechtaid s. Maen s. 6engus Olmucaid. Then Rothechtaid took the kingship thereafter, and he is one of the four kings of the
progeny of £rim6n from Oengus down to Nuadu Finn Fail—Rothechtaid,
Sirna s. Dian s. Deman, Giallchad s. Ailill Olchain, and Nuadu Finn Fail
himself. Then six kings of the progeny of Eber succeeded, from £nna
Airgdech to Bress Ri—Muinemon, Aildergdoit, Rotechtaid Rotha, Elim Olfinechta, Art Imlech and Bress Ri himself. Thereafter followed the princedom of the Ulaid.
Poem no. CII.
This is the opinion of certain historians, that every king. South and
North, of the progeny of Eber and lErimon, were contemporaries, till the Ulaid came into the princedom. Thereafter was the princedom of the
Ulaid, for a space of seven generations, from Nuadu to Ugaine the Great
s. Eochu Buadach; Cermna and Sobairce were the first of the Ulaid who took the kingship of Ireland. Ireland was divided thereafter between
Cermna and Sobairce, namely from Inber Colptha to Luimnech; each of
them from his fortress. Dun Sobairce and Dun Cermna. They were of lording stock, being the two sons of Ebric the lording; Ireland was for an hundred years under that division, after which that princedom was
extinguished. Thereof was it chantedPoe7n no. XCVIII.
Here are the names of the fifteen kings from Cimbaeth to ConchoborPoem no. CVIII.
Thereafter the princedom of Ulaid was sundered from Temair, and
Eochu Buadach s. Dui took the kingship of Ireland—the father of Ugoine
Mor, who was foster-son to Cimbaeth s. Finntan.

the Ulaid was sundered from Temair.
W

Eochu Buadach, foster-son of Cimbaeth s. Fintan and of Macha, slew him, for it is he who slew Reehtaid Rigderg in vengeance ''for his foster-mother. Then the kingship of Temair was again sundered from the Ulaid.

Cessair Chrothach d. of the king of the Franks. And she bore
twenty-five children to him, twenty-two sons and three daughters. Some say that Ugoine took the kingship of all Eui'ope, and divided Ireland into twenty-five shares (a-s under). Ireland was thus divided for three hundred years, till the

Poem no. CIX.
Ugoine fell at the hands of his owni blrothfer, Bodbchad s. Eochu, in Telach-in-Choscair in Mag Maireda in Brega.
None of the progeny of Ug^oine left children, except Cobthach
Coel Breg and Loiguire Lore, and two daughters, whom Fergus Cnai left, na;mely, Maer and Medan. Maer was the mother of Eochu mac Luchta, and Medan nurtured him; but this cannot be true, on account of the leng-th of the times involved. It is from Cobthach that there come the four families of Temair, Colman, Aed Slaine, Coniall an,d Eogan; and the three Connachta,, with nine cantreds in each divisioni; and the nine cantreds of Airgialla, and the nine ciantreds of the Dessi, I'othairt and Eraind and Alban and Dal Riata and Dal Piatach, that is, the kings of the Ulaid.

cannot be true, because of the length of the times involved.
It is at Ugoine that the Freemen of Ireland unite—Leth Cuinn
and the Albanaig—because these are of Leth Cuinn, being the descendants of Fiachu Fer Mara s. Oengus Tuirmach Temraig. For those are the descendants of Ugoine in Leth Cuinn; and of his descendants are the Laigin and the Osraige. Ireland was three hundred years under that division, till the Provincials
came, namely Ailill s. Ros who was called Mac Mata of
Mulirisc, and Conchobor s. Fachtma, who was called Mac Nessa, and Curoi s. Daire and Coirpre Nia Fer s. Ros and Eochu s. Lucht. Of the names of the sons of Ugoine the historian

daughters. Now when Ugoine took the kingship of all Europe, to wit from the Meeting of the Three Waters to the Caspian Sea,
and to the Tyrrhene Sea as others say; he divided Ireland among his children (as below). Ireland was under that division for a space of three hundred years, till the Provincials came;
in the time of Conaire the Great s. Eterscel were those
Provincials—Conchobor s. Nessa over Ulaid, Curoi and Eochu
mac Luchta over Mumu, Ailill mac Mata in Connachta, and
Coirpre Nia Fer over the province of the Gailian in Temair of Brug Niad. That is why Coirpre Nia Fer is called king of
Temair. Of those children, and of the division of Ireland,
Eochu chanted thus

World when Ugoine died, and when that division of the progenv
of Ugoine was made; and it is in his reign that Loiguiri Lore s. Ugoine took the kingship of Ireland. Two years had he, till he fell at the hands of Cobthach Coel Breg, his own brother.

554 his. Then Ugoine took the kingship of all Western Europe, from
the Tyrrhene Sea westward, and he afterwards divided Ireland among
his sons and daughters; that is, twenty-five divisions; and this is why
he divided it, that his descendants should govern Ireland for ever. But
not one of them left progeny, except Cobthach Coel Breg, and Loiguire
Lore, ancestor of the Laigin, and two daughters of Fergus Cnai, Maer
and Medan. Alaer was mother of Eoehaid s. Lucht, and Medan nurtured him. At that Ugoine the Freemen of the descendants of £rim6n unite,
namely Leth Cuinu and the Albanaig; because they are of Leth Cuinn,
namely the descendants of Fiachu Fer Mara s. 6engus Tuirmech Temrach.
For those are the descendants of Ugoine in Leth Cuinn, and of his descendants are the Laigen and the Osraige. Ireland was three hundred years under that division, till the Provincials came; Ailill s. Eos who was
called the son of Mata of Muiresc, and Conchobor s. Fachtna who was called Mac Nessa, and Ciiroi mac Daire, and Cairpre Nia Fer s. Ros, and

He took the province of the Gailiain before he slew Cobthach in Dinn Rig, over the brink of the Barrow, on Great Christmas night, so that it was from the broad spears (laigne), which the followers of Labraid brought with them, that "Laigin" is named.
When Cobthach Coel Breg fell at the hands of Labraid in vengeance for his father and his grandfather, from that out there was war between Laigin and Leth Cuinn. Three hund<red and seven yea^rs from that night to the night in which Christ was born of the Virgin J\Iary in Bethlehem of Juda.

593. R^ : Eithne Imgel, daughter of the king of Alba, escaped over sea. She was pregnant, and in; the East she brought forth Tuathal s. Fiachu. She nurtoired him for twenty years in the East, and his mother came back with him. She landed at Inber Domnann, and bandits of Ireland came to meet her there,
to wit, Fiachra, Cassan, and Finnmall, with a company of eight hundred warriors. They gave him [Tuathal] the kingship immediately, and he broke thirty battles against Mumu,
twenty-seven againsit Laigin, twenty-eight against the men of
Mumu, and twenty-eight against Connachta—an hundred and twenty-three in all. The Assembly of Tenia ir was convened by
him thereafter. The men of Ireland came there, with wives, sons, and daughters. Tuathal took sureties of sun, moon, and every power in heaven and earth, that though the Provincials of Ireland might be equal in power, they should not be equal in right of Ireland with the progeny of Tuathal, but that his progeny should have the kingship for ever.

So Tiiathal fell in Dal Araide iri the Bog? of Battle, through treachery, in the place where Ollar and Ollarba broke forth, at the hands of Mai s. Rochraide king of the province, after com
pleting an hundred and ten years in the kingship. But thirty years was he in the kingship of Ireland.
R^ : Thereafter Tuathal came over sea to Ireland, after he was reared in Alba. And he came to Temai'r, to the place where Elim s. Conrai was; and they gave the battle of Aicill, where
Elim s. Conrai was slain by Tuathal. And Tuathal broke four
score and five battles, securing Ireland, and avenging his father. It was in the reign of Hadrian that Tuathal took the kingship of Ireland, and he was thirty years in the kingship of Ireland. This is why he is called Tuathal Techtmar, for his "coming over-sea" {techt tar muir) to Ireland to take it against iJie Aithech Tuatha. By Tuathal was each province in Ireland
lopped of its head, and so ''Mide" was the name given to them, that is "the neck" of every province. Or it is from Mide s. Brith the name comes, unde dicitur "Mide". Tuathal took a strong, powerful hold over Ireland after destroying her pirates and her bandits. Then the Assembly of Temair was convened by Tuathal Techtmar, and the Provincials of Ireland came together to Temair; these are the Provincials who came there, Fergus, Febal, and Eochu mac Conrach in joint rule over Ulaid, and Eogan mac Ailella Erann over South ]\Iumu, and Conrach mac Derg over Connachta, and Eochu mac Dairi over
Greater i\Iumu, and Eochu mac Echach Doimlein of the Domnann over Laigen. They gave then sureties of sun and moon and every power over Heaven and Earth that though the Provincials of Ireland might have equal power, they should not have equal right with his own descendants for ever.
593 a. Here are the battles which Tiiathal fought to hold
Ireland against the Serfs and the Fir Bolg, to wit
Aicill, where Elim s. Conroi, king of Ireland, was slain. He was of
the Domnann.

Here [M 298 /? 9] follows another extract from Boroma,
corresponding to sections 8-13 of Stokes's edition. A paragraph follows, describing the division of the spoil among the allies of TuatJmJ, evidently belonging to the same document, though it happens to he absent from the MSS. used by Stokes. It begins

came, after a long time, so that it is he who subdued them (the Ligmuine,
and the Gaileoin, and the Fir Bolg) ; that is the trouble which they
caused in Ireland, and their oppression of the Tuatha De Danann. God
sent great vengeances upon the Aithech Tuatha, so that they had no
corn, or milk, or mast, or fish in the waters, after they had arisen against the Freemen. Then Ugaine imposed the surety of all creatures, visible
and in^'isible, upon the men of Ireland that his children should
have the kingship, without contention, for ever. They were twenty-two sons and three daughters; and he divided Ireland between them, in
twenty-five divisions. Cobthach Coel was the eldest of them. Of ihe

Alba, the people of Oengus and Loarn and Comgell, and Cenel Gabrain,
and Fir Fibe, and Ath Odlaig, and the Eastern Gaedil, and many other
peoples beside, and Corco Duibne, and Corco Baiscinn and all the Muscraige. As for Eochu Feidlech, it is in his time that the Provincials
came, Conchobor and Cairbre, Cu Roi and Eochu s. Luchta. and Ailill,
and Medb d. Eochu Feidlech, and the three Finns of Emain, his
three sons — Bres and Nar and Lothar were their names. To them came their sister Clothra, so that they begat a son upon her, Lugaid Riab nDerg. Then the Finns gave battle to their father, the battle of
Druimm Criaich, and her three brothers were crushed. Thereafter Lugaid begat a son upon his mother, Crimthann s. Lugaid; and he took the
kingship of Ireland thereafter. It is he who went forth on the adventure
of Crimthann out from Dun Etair, when he took the golden chariot, and the splendid chessboard. It is the belief of certain historians that this
was the time when the Son of the Living God, Jesus Christ, was born in Beth-lehem of Juda; or that in the seventh year of the reign of
Conchobor He was bom, et quod est uerius, or that it wa.s in the
twenty-seventh year of the reign of Conchobor that He was born, or that
it was in the fiftieth year after the birth of Conchobor that Christ was
bom. And in the seventh year of Octavianus Augustus, Christ was born, and in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Christ was
crucified as Flann saith
{Poem)
Son to that Crimthann was Feradach Finn Fechtnach; to him was given the inJieritance from Morann, to preserve the truth (= legitimacy) of a
prince. Son to Feradach was Fiachu Finii[oilches] king of Ireland;
white were all the cattle of Ireland in his reign; and it is he whom the
Provincials slew in his own house in Temair, to wit Elim s. Conrai king of Ulaid, Eochu Anchenn king of Laigin, Forbri s. Fine king cf Muii:;_ and Sanb s. Cet s. Maga king of Connachta. As for Elim, it is he who sat in Temair after the slaving of Fiachu Finnoilches. That Fiachu

left no progeny save one son, who was in the womb of Eithne, daughter
of the king of Alba; and she escaped over-sea from the slaughter, That
boy was Tiiathal Teehtniar. He was nurtured till the end of twenty
years in Alba, and his mother came with him into Ireland for his instruction in learning, to the house of his father, to wit, the house of Temair. There, in Inber Domnann, she met the bandits that were there
of the Laigin, with six hundred warriors, namely Fiacha, Cassan, and
his brother Finmael (sic lege). They made Tiiathal king forthwith, and
came with him to the sward of Temair. A battle was fought between them and Elim, and Elim fell there, namely in the battle of Acaill; and
that night Tiiathal slept in Temair. He broke twenty-five battles against the Ulaid, twenty-five against the Laigen, twenty-five against Mumu, and twenty-five against the Connachta; as Mael-Muru Othna reckoned them,
in the preface of the poem of Flann s. Mael-Sechlainn
(Poem)
Now after Tiiathal had broken all those battles, the Assembly of Temair
was convened by him; and the Gaedil came to him thereafter, and gave him sureties of every creature, visible and invisible, in the matter of the kingship of Ireland, that his progeny should have it after him for ever ; and though some might have equal strength, they should not have equal right with the progeny of Tuathal. In this manner did he confirm his grandfather Ugoine. This is that Tuathal who bound the Boroma upon the Laigen for the crime of the slaying of his two daughters, Fithir
and Dairine, by the follv of Eochu s. Eochu king of Laigin. Fithir died of shame, and Dairfine died of lamenting her, on Mag Luadat in Laigin,
ut poeta dixit(Poem)
This is the tax—thrice fifty hundred kine, thrice fifty hundred boars, thrice fifty hundred wethers, and twelve cauldrons, along with a brazen
cauldron into which would go twelve beeves—and fifty wedded couples,
to ward them perpetually. Each one of these things was to be paid
perpetually, every second year. There were forty kings by whom this
tax was exacted, from the time of Tuathal to the time of Finnachta,

Finnachta, he it is who remitted the Boroma. after forcing it into one
place, for Moling of Luachair, on account of the song that he made
for him; or perhaps it was to gain Heaven that he remitted it. Moling
said(Poem)
But Adamnan found fault with Finnachta for remitting the Boroma, and
said to him(Poem)
As for the Boroma, it used to be divided into three parts, a third for the Gonnachta, and a third for the king of Temair, and a third for Airgialla. [Every battle and every conflict which Conn's Half and Laigen gave, from Tuathal to Finnachta s. Duncliad, was against the Boroma, and against the (levy of) bondmaids for the thirty royal maidens with
thirty handmaids about each, who fell in the Cloenfertai in Temair on
Saniain night, at the hands of Dunlang, king of Laigen,—along with ten daughters of Cormac ua Cuinn, refusing the eric of Niall Noi-giallaeh,
whom Eochu s. Enna Ceinnselaich slew. So Tuathal fell in Dal Araide,
in Moin in Chatha, through treachery, in the place where Ollar and
Ollarba, the two rivers, burst forth ; Cennguba is the name of the hill
where he was slain, by Mai s. Rochraide, king of the province, ut poeta
dixit
(Poem)
Thereafter Mai took the kingship of Ireland after Tuathal liad completed
thirty years in the kingship of Ireland. Of him the poet chanted
Poem no. CXIV.
Mai s. Rochraide took the kingship of Ireland for four years, till he fell at the hands of Feidlimid Rechtad s. Tuathal and Baine d. Seal Balb,
from whom is named Cnoc Baine in Airgialla. For there was she buried, in her hill, and by her was dug Raith Mor of Mag Lemna over the Ulaid.

their names), and they pressed upon Conn, and wounded him. But he rounded and beheaded
them. The king of Laigin remained in Temair till the end of seven years, and the strength of Conn increased again ; and he put him out of Temair and exacted the Boroma from him. Finn mac Cumaill paid the Bo<roma to

of Eochu Doimlen — the Three Collas, Colla Uais, Colla F6 Crich, and Colla Menu. Dubchomar was the name of the
druid of Fiachu Sraibtene, and he fell there, so that from him the battle has its name, "the Battle of Dubchomar." After that battle the strength of Cairpre Lifechair increased, and he exacted the Boroma without a battle so long as he lived. Many were the battles which the Laigin fought about the

Then they attacked him severely with evil and inciting words, so that he should come against them ; in order that the kingship should end with him, and that they should have
purgation of the kin-slaughter which they had wrought upon his father. Not thus, however, did Muiredach deal with them ; but he gave them a great and honourable welcome, and a partnership in battle with the Ulaid. So that they slew Fergus Foga, son of (F)raecher Forthren, in the battle of Achad Lethderg in Airgialla ; and thus was that Fergus the last king of Emain Macha. After that battle Muiredach endowed the progeny of the Collas with the Ulidian share of the Boroma for ever.

at the prayer of that just man, and killed the king before all the host. Scholars suppose that it was Formenius himself who shot an arrow from a bow, and that it was thus that the king died ; and it is said that it was by that arrow that Niall s. Eoehu was slain afterwards. The men of Ireland took the body of the king with them to Ireland, with four men of rank beneath it, to
carry it : Dungus, Flanngns, Tuathal, and Tomaltach ; and he broke ten battles between Sliab Elpa and Ireland, though he was dead and lifeless.

this the historian Gilla Caemain chanted the following
composition
Where Loigniri died was in ]\Iag Lifi between two hills, firiii and Alba. So that of the deaths and times of those
kings whom we have specified, down to this, from Slaine s.
Dela to Loiguiri mac Neill, before Patrick, Gilla Caemain, that is, Gilla Samthainne, sang
the following song
Poem no. CXV.
('^)[0f the Boroma below, according to Flann]
[Three poems.}
Of the princedoms of Ireland and of their times, of the kings from the reign of Loiguire s. Niall to the time of Rnaidri s. Toirdelbach ua Conchoboir. Loiguire s. Niall
Noi-giallach took the kingship for thirty years after the coming
of Patrick. Ard J\Iacha was founded. Secundinus and Old Patrick slept in peace, Loiguiri s. Niall died thereafter in Grellach da Phil, on the side of Caisse, in IMag Line between the two hills ; Eire and Alba were their names. The sureties that he gave to the Laigen that he would not demand the Boroma of them after they had captured him when plundering
them—he gave sun and moon that he would not press upon
them any longer. Thereafter they—sun and moon and the
elements in general—slew him for violating them, whence this
was said

Then Ailill Molt s. Dathi s. Fiachra s. Eochu Muigmedon
took the kingship of Ireland for a space of twenty years, and sent messengers to seek tlie Borama from Crimthann s. Enna
Ceinnselach king of Laigin ; but he obtained it not—only a challenge of battle concerning it. So Ailill assembled Leth Cuinn and went into Laigin. Crimthann assembled a great
company of Laigin against Ailill Molt, to Duma Aichir, and
a battle was set there—the battle of Duma Aichir; it broke
against Ailill Molt, and his people were put to slaughter. There was a year after that without exacting the Boroma. At the end of a year the nobles of Leth Cuinn assembled to exact the Boroma, and the fist-fight of Bri Leith was set against the Laigin before Ailill ]\Iolt, so that he put the Laigin under servitude thereafter and exacted the Boroma without battle. Howbeit Ailill Molt fell in the battle of Ocha at the hands of Lugaid Lonn s. Loiguire s. Niall and of Muirchertach s. Ere
and of Fergus Cerrbel s. Conall Crimthann s. Enna Cennselach
king of Laigin. [It is then that Na Lee and Cairleog were
given to him—Fiachra—as a reward in land for (help in) the
battle]. "^"^ TJnde Bcc mac De dixit

Then Lugaid s. Loiguire took the kingship of Ireland, and
sent messengers to demand the Bororaa, but he obtained it not
Avithout ])attle. So he assembled the nobles of Leth Cuinn to exact the Boroma. The Laigen came to Mag nAillje and the battle of I\lag nAilbe was set between them. It broke against
Lugaid, and Muirchetach s. Ere and Cairbre Mor s. Niall ; and in revenge for the above battle Muiredach and Cairbre kept out of Laigen so long as they were alive. Scholars reckon that Lugaid did not exact the Boroma but once, and that imperfectly. In the time of Lugaid, Patrick came into Ireland and went to Temair, where Lugaid was, and promised him wheat without ploughing and constant milk with the kine so long as he lived, and heaven at the end of his life, and blessing [of fruitfulness] of hounds and wheat and the queen. But Lugaid accepted that not; and as he accepted it not, Patrick cursed him and his queen Aillinn d. Oengus s. Nadfraich king of ]\Iumu. So that from that out queens in Temair are ste^rile, as are the dogs of Temair also. Lugaid s. Loiguiri died in Achad Forcha at the curse of the "Adzehead" that a-lighningstroke from heaven slew liim after he had made refusal to the ''Adzehead".

company of Illann s. Dunlaing, king of Laigen. The battle of Det[n]a was set between them in Brega, and Ardgal s. Conaill Earrbreg and Colcu IMocloithi s. Crunn s. Feidlimid s. Colla Da Crieh, king of Airgialla, were slain. It was broken against the Laigen, both that battle and many others, and the
Boroma was exacted so long as he was alive thereafter. Of tiiose battles which Muirchertaeh set, the battle of Eibliu and of Mag nAilbe and of Almain, and the ravaging of Cliu over
Laigen, was this said

unintelligibly in both versions. The meaning seems to be, that the possession of
Temair was essential to entitle a man to be called "king", even "with opposition".
If he had all Leth Cuind, he would be thus qualified automatically: all he needed
was a sufficiency of the other half of the country to entitle him to claim the
kingship of the whole. But if his chief claim were founded upon the possession of
Leth Moga, he must have Temair and its peoples at least in addition.

(a) This is apparently the synod held in a.d. 1111, at a place called Fiad-micbengusso, somewhere near Uisnech Hill in Co. Westmeath, to make certain
regulations concerning public morals. See the Annals of Ulster and the Four Masters, ad annum, though the entries are not very illuminating. They suggest,
however, that the reading in our text, " Fri da moc nOengu^a ", is a corruption of Fiad-inac-nOengusa.

Criticism of this list of kings, and of the verse lists which follow
and echo it, must be left to any scholar who chooses to devote himself
to the special study which it would involve. That such a list, of
158 monarchs, extending from the misty past when ' ' Mnus son of Belus "
flourished in Mesopotamia, down to the later Roman emperors, could have
been preserved in Ireland as a historical record, is obviously inconceivable.
At best it must be an artificial compilation, woven out of fragments of
genealogies and lists of the chieftains of various localities. In the period
of Ogham inscriptions there was in the Decies of Waterford such a
succession, and their monuments remain, bearing names which show a
suggestive resemblance to some of the names in the king-list following Cobthach Coelbreg, no. 58, whose death is dated to 307 a.d. If we follow
out the genealogical connexions alleged to unite them, we shall find the
following facts :



SECTION IX.—THE ROLL OF THE KINGS. 415
Muircertach mac Tairdelbaig died. The Foreigners of Ireland adventured to Port Lairge and against Ath Cliath. Diarmait mac Muirehada king of Laigin died, in Ireland, of an unknown disease, without bell, without viaticum. Diarmait ua MailSechlainn, king of Mide, was slain. Henry king of the Saxons, that is, Fitz-Empress, came into Ireland, and returned again. Tigernan ua Ruairc king of Breifne was slain by Foreigners,
Poem no. CXXXVI.
The Roman numerals indicate the genealogical lines to wliich each
king is assigned; the initials s, gs, stand for son, grandson, of the king whose number follows them. The following names are found on Ogham
stones in the Decies : Melagia (compare no. 60); Macorbo (compare 61,
found as an ancestral name on three stones) : Catabar moco Firicorb
(compare no. 67, Adamair son of Ferchorb) : Neta-Segamonas (compare no. 72, also found as an ancestral name on three stones; in one of which
the descendant is called Lugtudeccas, the old genitive of Lugaid, who appears in no. 78 as a descendant of Nia Segamain). This material is
not very extensive, but it is sufficient to be impressive. It will be noticed
that all the names except Melge belong to the genealogical succession numbered III.

MacCarthy translates lines 1, 2, 4 of this quatrain "In a time
unpropitious, late, which foraying kings are spending . . . without injustice to the nobles of Ireland". This is peppered all along with
queries by subsequent critics, and certainly it does not look very convincing.
No recent lexicographer will allow a word amlaib = "unpropitious," or suggest a rendering for the word dealghnm. For the latter I must

(a) The six quatrains 77, B, C, 78, D 79 are written into a space originally
left blank, at the foot of the column on which this poem ends (fo. 312 B). They
are in ink of a weaker quality than the preceding quatrains, and, though I cannot
convince myself that they are in a different handwriting, they are certainly a
subsequent addition to the poem as originally written in the MS.

be content with leaving a blank; for the former I suggest a reminiscence
of the kings of Dublin named Amlaib, who, as being pirates from oversea, might well be called eatrach and ri ceroach. The second line begins with
imalr, which MacCarthy expands imaleter. I should rather suppose it to be meant for some form of malarta/id, and I render the line accordingly.
They met death of every kind

without conflict, without brilliance of fame ; [but] the King of Kings lives.
Ard Brecain is my home of fame

82, 83. These two quatrains are absent from B; possibly they were omitted on account of the elusiveness of their sense. Does the allusion to "heads" in line 4890 refer to the practice of head-himting, of which there is ample literary evidence? As noted above, the four quatrains following are absent from M.

666. A synchronism of the kings of the world and of the
Takings of Ireland. I have written in the beginning of the book
from the reign of Ninus son of Belus, who took the kingship of
the world in the beginning, to the fifth king of the Greeks ; and
from Partholon son of Sera, who took Ireland the first after the
Flood, to the fifth year of the reign of Tigernmas son of Follach,
who took the kingship of Ireland till the end of an hundred years,
as others say. We had better now wnrite here the synchronism of the nations individually.
667. Philopator then, the fifth king of the Greeks, had five
years in contemporary reign ivith Tigernmas ; 18 years was the length of the reign of Philopator ;
Then, his son Epiphanes after him, 27 years. Philometor, 25.
Euergetes, 28.
Ptolomeus Soter, 17. Alexander, 10. Physcon son of Cleopatra, 7.
[Cleopatra and Dionysius her husband, 30.]
Cleopatra after her husband
till Tulius Caesar, the first king of the Romans, deposed her.
That is, twelve("> kings and one queen of the Greeks, from
Alexander son of Philip to Cleopatra ; 270 years the length of heir kingship.
(a) Beginning with the fifth, whose four predecessors are counted in, though not
here named.

668. The kingship of the Macedonians after Alexander son of
Phih'p, which was till the end of 7 years, till Cassander slew
01ympias,(«) who sought that the kingship should be held by
Hercules son of Alexander ; Cassander afterwards slew them all,
Olympias, Hercules, and Roxana mother of Hercules.
Afterwards Cassander, 19 years; and his sons, his four sons W
Antipater, Antigonus, Philip, and Alexander.
Demetrius son of Antigonus, 9 years.
Poliorcetes, 7 years, till Pyrrhus slew him in Sicily.
Seleucus and Lysimachus, 6 years afterwards, till Pyrrhus
and Lysimachus fell at the hands of the followers of Seleucus.
Seleucus, moreover, fell before Ptolomeus Ceraunus after 9 months.
Meleagrus, 2 months.
Antipater, 4 months and 7 days. Sosthenes, 2 years.
Gonatas [sic lege], 35 years. Demetrius, 10 years. Antigonus, 15 years. Philippus, 35 [recte 42] years. Perses, 10 years.
He was the last prince of the Macedonians. There were eighteen
kings of the Macedonians ; 150 years was the whole length of
their princedom.
669. The kingship of Asia Minor after Alexander.
Antigonus, 18 years, till he fell at the hands of Seleucus and of Ptolomeus. Dimetrius son of Antigonus, 18 years, till he was slain in
Sicily. They did not maintain a kingship of Asia after that.
669. In both MSS. ' Alexandrach is resolved into Alexander oc, the oc being treated as a preposition.
(a) Ocus between " Cessander " and " Olimpias ", though found in both MSS
(in R even in the form " 7 et ") should be deleted; it ruiniS the sense.
(&) This confused statement is an uncomprehending perversion of the record of
Eusebius, that " The sons of Cassander, Antigonus and Alexander, reigned for four
years " (Anno Abrahae 1718).

670. The kingship of Babylon after Alexander.^*)
Seleucus Nicanor, 30 years. Antiochus Soter, 19 years.
Antiochus Theos, 15, till his own wife and his son slew him. Seleucus Callinicus, 3 years {recte 20) till he was slain in Phrygia. Antiochus Magnus, 30 years.
and his son Seleucus Philopator, 12 years.
Antiochus {magnus) Epiphanes, 15. It is he who slew the
Maccabees.
another Antiochus [Eupator] 5 (lege 2) years. Demetrius, 12 years. another Demetrius, 2 years.
Antiochus Sidetes, 9 years. It is he who plundered Jerusalem,
and took 300 talents of gold from Simon.
Hyrcanus ; it is he who found a casket in the tomb of David,
with many treasures therein.
Demetrius restored, 4 years.
Grypus, 12 years.
Antiochus Cyzicenus 19 years.
Philippus, 2 years ; the last king of the Greeks in Babylon.
That makes sixteen kings, 200 years lacking a month the length of their rule. Finit.
671. The rule of the Romans then, the last Avorld-empire.
It is not easy to reckon in their ranks and their grades, so many
are their consuls, conditores, legates, comites, dictators, patricians,
satraps, lictores, duces, and centuriones.
lulius Caesar, the first king of the Romans, had
four years and six months. Cassius and the two Bruti
slew him in his own Assembly. They inflicted 33
Praescriptio) to the so-called Annals of Tigernach, where Antiochus is called
" Thnusecok, Theos id est Deua ". In my opinion (as yet unpublished) of Tigernach,
I have suggested that "Thnusecok" is a misreading of ut socors, "how foolish"—•
a pious reader's interlined commemt on the blasphemous epiklesis of the monarch.
I think I see other evidences of the influence of pseudo-Tigernach throughout the
compilation before us. Further, two Seleuci are combined into one, Callinicus who
reigned 20 years; and his successor, not here specified, Ceraunus, who reigned the
three years credited to his namesake. There is no authority for the interpolation of
magnus before Epiphanes. The " Finit " at the end suggests that the document
originally ended with this paragraph.

APPENDIX. 579
In the tenth year of the reign of Theodosius Patrick came into
Ireland : the first year of Sixtus successor of Peter. That was
the fourth year of Loiguire mac Neill.
Theodosius, 18 years. Valentinianus and Maximianus, 7 years. Leo, 18 years. Oilioll Molt ivas then over Ireland.
Zeno, 17 years. Lugaid son of Loiguire tvas over Ireland. Anastasius, 20 years. Muircertach mac Erca was then over Ireland.
lustinus senior, 8 years. lustinianus [sic lege] his sister's son, 38 years. Diarmait mac Cerbaill over Ireland at that time. lustinus Minor, 5 years. Aed mac Ainmirech in Ireland. Tiberius Constantinus, 7 years. Aed Slaine and Colman Rimed over Ireland.
Mauri cius, 20 years. Aed Uairidnach and Suibne mac Colmain over Ireland.
Phocas, 9 years. Heraclius, 28 years. Domnall mac Aeda. Hercuhus,(«) 27 years ; or Heracleon with his mother, 5 years. Constantinus son of Heraclius, 3 months. Conall Cael and Cellach son of Mael-Coha in the kingship over Ireland at that time.
Constans son of Constantinus, 28 years ; The sons of Aed Slaine on Ireland at that time.
lustinianus minor [sic lege], 5 years.
Leo II, 10 years. Sechnasach mac Blathmaic in Ireland.
Tiberius III, 7 years. Cennfaelad mac Blathmaic over Ireland.
lustinianus maior again, 6 years. He slew Leontius and
Tiberius, and Philippicus slew him afterwards.
Philippicus, 18 (years) and 3 months, till Anastasius blinded
him at Nicaea.
(a) Heraclius and Herculius are obviously doublets of one personality. The
actual facts in the background are Heraclius, 610-640; his son, Constantine III,
poisoned by Martina, his stepmother, after a reign of 4 months; Martina and her
own son Heracleon deposed after six months and driven into exile—he with his nose
and she with her tongue cut off; Constans son of Constantine 641-6'68.

APPENDIX. 581
Anastasius II, 3 years, till Theodosius III deposed him at
Nicaea. Loingsech mac Aengusa was then in Ireland.
One year thereafter to Theodosius III, till he died in Religion.
Leo III, 9 years. Fergal mac Maile-Duin over Ireland.
Down to that point, the kings of the Universe are enumerated,
and those of Ireland along with them.
The remainder of this appendix might possibly be made the
subject of a special monograph, but as it would add some sixty
unprofitable pages to the present volume is hardly worth the
labour of transcribing and translating. It includes a series of
synchronisms by centuries, on this model :
" there were 100 (years) from the first year of lulius Caesar to the twelfth year
of Claudius, and five kings in that time, Octauianus, Tiberius,
Gains, Claudius. And 100 years from the ninth year of Eochu
Feidlech to the fifth year of Lugaid Riab-nderg, and six kings in
that time, Eochu Feidlech, Eochu Airem, Eterscel, Conaire Mor,
Lugaid Riab-nderg" : and so on. Then follows an enormously long
poem beginning Beidig dam a De do nim ; in which the syn
chronistic tables of Eusebius are set forth, versified in about
280 quatrains—the number varies in different copies. After
this comes what would be a more useful table, the synchronisms
of the Provincial Kings with the central Kings of Temair, but
this is irrelevant to the main subject of the book, and is, no doubt, a later accretion.
