Silver punch marked coin found at Keezhadi, ca. 200
BCE; Indus Script hieroglyphs on the coin signify mint
metalwork
While awaiting a sharp image and further write up from archaeologists, at least two symbols are comparable to Indus Script hieroglyphs: the sun's rays and tree.
Sun's rays: arka 'sun's rays' rebus: arka 'copper, gold'
Tree: kuṭi 'tree' rebus: kuṭhi 'smelter'. These are signifiers of metalwork resources of a mint.
See, for e.g. sun's rays hieroglyph on Dholavira seal impression
arka 'sun' Rebus: araka, eraka 'gold, copper, moltencast' PLUS karaḍū 'kid' Rebus: karaḍā 'hard alloy'. Thus, together, the rebus message: hard alloy of copper.
Kho. kār ʻear (CDIAL 3056) Rebus: khār 'blacksmith'.

The Silver coin found in Keezhadi excavation yesterday belong to the category of Punch Marked Coins which were commonly used by Pandyas during Sangam age. The 200 BCE period coin has Sun, Moon, Tree with six branches and few animals. It must be noted that such coins were also used by other Indian kingdoms at that time like Magadha & Maurya. They were said be minted initially by Janapadas.
Pandya coins also have a Trident within a fence & it would be interesting to see if Keezhadi coin also has that feature.
