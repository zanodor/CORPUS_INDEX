The Astral Family in Kassite Kudurrus Reliefs
Iconographical and Iconological Study of Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar Astral Representations
Sara PizziMenti
Man has always been fascinated by the vault of heaven. The stars, luminous points in the dark night, have been synonymous of immortality with their continuous and cyclical presence. Since the end of the III millennium b.c.e. Mesopotamians observed the sky, thinking that what happens in the sky was reflected in the earth. Stars were in fact messengers exerting a direct influence and serving as mediators between man
and gods, as man’s medium of communication with the divine1. For example, when Gudea, ensi of Lagash (end of the III millennium b.c.e.), started the construction of the Ningirsu Temple, the god said to him: “. . .I will tell you the bright star(s) (which
indicate) my regulations (?).”2, giving a clearly important role to the stars. The stars could in fact have a good or an evil influence in ritual intents. Also the main core of the MUL.APIN, the first Babylonian astronomical compendium, belongs to the end of the III millennium b.c.e. and precisely to 2048 b.c.e., as E. Weidner in 1915 and
then V.S. Tuman in 1992 demonstrated3, though B.E. Shaefer now suggests that the
epoch for the observations is 1370 +/- 100 b.c.e.4. Because of their immortality stars and planets were considered heavenly images of gods. In a famous preyer of the first half of the II millennium b.c.e., stars
and planets were invoked with the epithet of “Gods of the night”5, because of their appearance only in nocturnal time. This strong connection between divine and astral world is also supported by the Astrolabe Pinches, where astronomical names
are followed by names of divinities or by their epithets6. Between the numerous heavenly bodies that crosses the sky, the Moon, the Sun and the planet Venus were the first and the most important ones that were identified with gods. The Moon and the Sun, astral correspondents of Nanna/Sîn and Utu/ Šamaš, beat the time, alternating night with day, distinction so important not only in daily life but also in religious cult. Venus, astral correspondent of the love warrior deity Inanna/Ištar, has a course extremely different. It has in fact a double aspect as

‘morning star’ or ‘evening star’7. These three main astral deities are between first with a double representation as anthropomorphic deities or divine symbols linked to their heavenly correspondent. The moon-god Nanna/Sîn appears as symbolic representation since neo-sumerian period (end of the III millennium b.c.e.). His divine
symbol is the crescent with the hump toward down8 (Fig. 1a). This specific crescent representation could be explained making a parallel with the reality. It is important to notice that the Mesopotamians always started from the “direct view”. In fact, looking from the Mesopotamian latitude, the waxing moon has really its hump to
ward down9. The sun-disk (Fig. 1b) is the symbol of the sun-god Utu/Šamaš10, and it
is surely identified in the Naram-Sin Stele11 (2254–2218 b.c.e.), following the Irene Winter suggestion that considers the three astral symbols on the upper part of the stele as the Sun in its three main positions: the sunrise, the culmination and the
sunset12. Since the Akkadian period the Sun is represented as a circular body from
which eight triangular elements and eight rays are coming out13. Finally, the astral
symbol of Ištar is the eight pointed star14 (Fig. 1c). As for the sun-disk, the nucleus of the symbol is the central circular body from which only eight triangular elements are coming out. During the I Dynasty of Babylon (first half of the II millennium b.c.e.) the way of representation of these three astral symbols was standardised. The crescent had no changes, with its hump toward down, while the point number
7. Some literary texts testify the identification of the love warrior deity Inanna/Ištar with the planet Venus at least since the beginning of the II millennium b.c.e. (Picchioni 2000: 38), but it is possible that she was seen as the planet Venus also in the III millennium b.c.e. (Rochberg 2009: 54–55). In fact some sumerian hymns reveals this connection. For example in a poem of praise to Inanna and Iddin-Dagan, she is adressed as “the radian star, Venus (mulDili-bad), the great light which fills the holy heavens”(ETCSL t.2.5.3.1:89). She is also called “Lady of the Evening” and “Lady of the Morning”, testifying the knew double aspect of Venus as ‘evening star’ and ‘morning star’: “My Lady looks sweet wonder from heaven. / The people of Sumer parade before the holy Inanna. / Inanna, the Lady of the Evening, is radiant. I sing your praises holy Inanna. / The Lady of the Evening is radiant on the horizon.” (KramerWolkstein 1984: 101); “My Lady looks sweet wonder from heaven. / The people of Sumer parade before the holy Inanna. / Inanna, the Lady of the Morning, is radiant. I sing your praises holy Inanna. / The Lady of the Morning is radiant on the horizon.” (Kramer–Wolkstein 1984:103). 8. The link between the moon-god Sîn and the crescent is confirmed by pictorial evidence and religious text. For a specific analysis of this symbol see: van Buren 1945: 60–64; Seidl 1989: 97–98; BlackGreen 1992: 54; Collon 1992: 19–37; Herles 2006: 235–236. 9. Collon 1922: 20–21. 10. The sun-disk is clearly identified as the symbol of the sun-god Šamaš by the stone tablet of Nabû-apla-iddina (IX century b.c.e.) and its duplicates in clay (King 1912: 120, Pl XCVIII: C1–2), where the king is conducted by a priest into the presence the Sun-god. A great solar-disk is represented in front of the god, while a lunar-disk, a sun-disk and a star are place into the shrine, above the god. The label above them reads: “Sîn, Šamaš, and Ištar are set over against the haevenly ocean”. For a specific analysis of this symbol see: van Buren 1945: 87–90; Seidl 1989: 98–100; Black–Green 1992: 168; Herles 2006: 254–255. 11. Moortgat 1967: fig. 155. 12. I.J. Winter suggested that the representation of the Sun in its three main position could be the visual translation of the phrase “in a single day”, amply attested in the texts of Naram-Sîn (Winter 2004: 24). 13. See for example the over mentioned “Naram-Sin Stele”. 14. The eight-pointed star is known since prehistoric times. In early representation it may have had a general astral significance, but at least from Old Babylonian Period (or Early Dynastic Period) it was associated to the goddess Inanna/Ištar. For a specific analysis of this symbol see: van Buren 1945: 82–85; Seidl 1989: 100–101; Black–Green 1992: 169–170; Ornan 2005: 151–152; Herles 2006: 226–227. Following some interpretation, the star could have solar meaning in prehistoric times (Goff 1963: 27); see for example the star painting of Teleilat Ghassul.



The Astral Family in Kassite Kudurrus Reliefs 153
of Venus was fixed to eight, and the number of the triangular elements and of the
rays of the sun-disk was fixed to four15 (Fig. 1). With end of the I Dynasty of Babylon and the rising of the Kassite dynasty, in the second half of the II millennium b.c.e., a transformation happened in the religious thought and in the representation
of the gods16. It could be noticed a gradual but continuous transformation in their representation, with the introduction of the symbolic representation of the divinities that substituted the anthropomorphic one. Now on, Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar will be no more the only gods symbolically represented. Symbolic divine representations are the main subject of the decoration of the
kudurrus, the Babylonian boundary stones, more correctly called narûs17. Between the symbols represented on them, those of Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar seem to have a predominant role. By analysing the 110 kudurrus and fragments, it is possible to suppose their presence over all the kudurrus reliefs, as Ursula Siedl suggested in
198918. Moreover they are always placed on the upper part of the relief or on the top of the kudurrus, the same place that they occupy in the real world: the UP, the heavenly vault. A stylistic change and evolution is noticed for two of the three astral symbols here analysed. Venus for example isn’t always represented with the classical eight pointed star, but the point number of the star could be five, six or eight. Only with the II Dynasty of Isin (1154–1024 b.c.e. ca.) Venus will be represented again with the standard eight pointed star. The same thing could be noticed for the Šamaš sun-disk. If at the beginning the sun-disk is represented with the classical
four points and four rays shape, then, with the kudurru SB 2319 (Fig. 2), belonging to the Meli-Shi-pak kingdom (1186–1172 b.c.e.), a new shape appears, with only eight rays coming out from the central circle. If the central circle is the representation of the heavenly body, the triangular elements are the representations of the light and the rays are the representations of the heat, it is possible to suppose that the main characteristic of the Sun, in its symbolic representation, is the heat. Coming back to the position of the sun-disk, the crescent and the eight pointed star on the kudurrus reliefs, the analysis of the those belonging to the Kassite period, has shown that these three symbols, always placed in the upper part of the reliefs, don’t have fixed relative positions. In fact it is possible to distinguish some patterns. Each pattern has a towards of reading given by the crescent, the only symbol with a towards of reading, because it must have always its hump toward down. The distinguishable patterns could be of two different types: in the first type, the

most represented, the symbols are placed on a right line, while in the second type the symbols are the vertexes of a triangle (Fig. 3). Moving our attention from the symbols patterns to the sky, also the Moon, the Sun and the planet Venus don’t have fixed relative positions, but their positions cyclically change. These three astral bodies could be viewed together only at the sunrise or at the sunset, depending on the course of Venus. Venus has in fact a cycle of 584.4 days divided into four different phases: Venus is the ‘morning star’, visible at the sunrise for some 263 days; afterwards it remains invisible for nearly 50 days; then Venus is the ‘evening star’, visible at the sunset for another 263 days; and a

last “darkness” phase during which Venus is not visible for about 8 days, before
appearing again as the ‘morning star’20. As ‘morning star’ Venus is placed at the
right of the Sun (Fig. 4a), while as ‘evening star’, it is placed at the left21 (Fig. 4b). At the end of the II millennium b.c.e. Babylonians also knew the course of Venus, as testified by the MUL.APIN: “Venus become visible either in the East or in the
West.”22 The Moon also changes its position, but with a shorter course: only 29.53
days23, course which the Mesopotamian month was based on24. Finally the relative

The Mesopotamians had a lunar month. The moon has in fact a predominant role in the determining the length of the year, as it is noted by Rim Sin of Larsa (1822–1763 b.c.e.): “Nanna, who establishes the months, who completes the year” (RIM 4 220 5–6). Each month begun “at the moment when, following the period of invisibility due to nearness of the sun, the lunar crescent appears again briefly on the western horizon just after sunset” (Rochberg-Halton 1992: 810). Each month was 29 or 30 days, and its length was based upon sightings of the moon and not upon a predeterminate pattern of alternating 29- and 30- day month. (Cohen 1993: 3–4).

position between Moon and Sun has a cycle of about 18,61 years25. Thus, Sun, Moon and Venus do not have fixed relative positions, however their relative positions have complicated periodicities based on their motion in the sky. A shorter cycle, based on the Moon course and on the Venus motion, as ‘morning star’ or ‘evening star’,
is distinguishable. In their nocturnal sky observations, the tupšarru26, looking toward South, as testified by the MUL.APIN, the East on the left and the West on the
right27, could see a cyclically changing of the relative positions of Sun, Moon and Venus, corresponding, in a short term, to the Moon cycle and characterised by a passage from a linear pattern to a triangular shape pattern or vice versa, it depends on Venus (Fig. 5).
A linear pattern is represented on the kudurru SB 80028, probably belonging to the Meli-shi-pak kingdom (1186–1172 b.c.e.) (Fig. 6). Here the Sun, the Moon

and Venus are placed on a right line. The Moon is at the first place, while Venus is placed at the left of the Sun, as ‘evening star’. Making a reconstruction of the heavenly vault during the kingdom of Meli-shi-pak, it is possible to put in evidence a cyclical correspondence in the real sky of this pattern. Vice-versa a triangular shape pattern example is the kudurru SB
2129, belonging to the Marduk-apla-iddina I kingdom (1171–1159 b.c.e.) (Fig. 7). In this case the Moon and the Sun are on the same line, forming the base of the triangle, while Venus, placed up, between them, is the vertex. Because of the position of Venus at the left of the Sun, that pattern too is the representation of a sunset, with Venus as ‘evening star’. Making a reconstruction of the heavenly vault during the kingdom of Marduk-apla-iddina I, it is possible to find, also in this case, a perfect cyclical correspondence. Mesopotamians believed that every aspect of the real world was due to the divine will, and that every aspect of the real world could be used for divination. Thus, every thing had a specific important meaning, and noth
ing was casual30. Thus, it is possible to suppose that also in artistic production nothing was casual and that every single representation had a specific meaning. So, finally,

the representation patterns of the crescent, the sun-disk and the eight pointed star, are not due to the artist’s will, but they could represent the real relative positions assumed by Sun, Moon and Venus at the moment of the drawing up of the contract written on the kudurru’s surface. With the end of the Kassite Dynasty and the ascent of the II Dynasty of Isin, at the end of the II millennium b.c.e., a strong change in kudurru’s reliefs happened, looking at this astral triad. Their position in the relief is always in the upper part or on the top of the kudurru, but quite all the patterns identified in the kudurrus belonging to the Kassite period disappear. Now on, the three astral symbols are represented following a right line in this order: crescent,
sun-disk and eight pointer star31. Looking at the real world and at the real relative positions that Sun, Moon and Venus could assume in the sky, this new pattern has surprising no correspondent at all. However there’s a strong connection between the three gods represented by these three astral symbols. In the prayer of “Kussulu to the Moon-god” (1850–1500 b.c.e.) is said: “He married, he had a son
and a daughter”32. Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar have in fact a family tie: Sîn, married with Ningal, is the father
of Šamaš and Ištar33. The brother-sister tie between Šamaš and Ištar is also testified by the myth of Inanna’s descent to the Netherworld. When Dumuzi make his appeal to the sun-god, the protector of justice and honesty, he call him his brother-in-law:
31. See for example the kudurru BM 90936 (King 1912: Pl. CIV). 32. Foster 2005: 215. 33. Inanna /Ištar was considered the daughter of the moon-god, as it is attested in literary texts since old-babylonian period, but it seems possible that she is not thought to be the daughter of the moongod before the UrIII period (Hall 1985: 736). Also the sun-god Utu/Šamaš was considered the son of the moon-god at least since the old-babylonian period, but this genealogical relation dates back to the UrIII period of earlier. (Hall 1985: 740).

The Astral Family in Kassite Kudurrus Reliefs 159
“O Utu, you are my brother-in-law, I am the husband of your sister. I brought cream to your mother’s house,
I brought milk to Ningal’s house.”34
Instead the father-son tie between Sîn and Šamaš is supported by the numerous
sumerian hymns, where Šamaš is called “sired from Sîn” and “born from Ningal”35. Finally, Ištar is celebrated as the daughter of Ningal, the Sîn’s wife, in the Agu
shaya poem36; and Assurnasirpal I (1050–1032 b.c.e.) dedicated a psalm to Ištar,
with the epithet of “daughter of Sîn, twin sister of Šamaš”37. So, if this divine group could be considered as a family, it is possible to individuate a kind of hierarchy. Sîn is placed on the first place as father, followed by Šamaš. In a prayer to the moon-god for an eclipse is said: “O Sîn. . .Overwhelming is your light, as the Sun-god [your]
first-born!” 38. So, as first-born of Sîn, Šamaš occupies the second place, finally followed by his sister Ištar. This hierarchy is perfectly correspondent to the order of representation of the astral symbols introduced by the II Dynasty of Isin on kudurrus reliefs (Fig. 8). Finally, the strong difference between the representation of Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar in kudurrus belonging to the Kassite period and those belonging to the II Dynasty of Isin can thus reflects a social and ideological change. The representation that imitates the real positions of Moon, Sun and Venus into the heavenly vault changes into a conventional one that reflects the hierarchy of this divine family. Finally, this strong difference between the representation of Sîn, Šamaš and Ištar in kudurrus belonging to the Kassite period and those belonging to the II Dynasty of Isin can reflect a social and ideological change. In fact, with the reign of Nabucodonosor I (1125–1104 b.c.e. ca.), one of the most important sovereign of the II Dynasty of Isin, an extraordinary political, military and religious renaissance happened. Probably during these years the babylonian clergy started theological speculations, with Marduk as chief of the gods. A change happened also in the representation of Moon, Sun and Venus in the kudurrus reliefs. During the II Dynasty of Isin on the kudurrus surfaces the representation that imitates the real positions of Moon, Sun and Venus into the heavenly vault changes into a conventional one that reflects the hierarchy of this divine family.

See for example Hall 1985: 147. 36. “Let me praise the greatest one, the warrior among the gods, / The daughter of Ningal’s might and fame let me extol! / Ištar, the greatest one, the warrior among the gods, / The daughter of Ningal, let me tell of her might!” (The Agušaya Poem: vv. I:1–8; Foster 2005: 97. 37. On occasion of illness: v. 6 (Foster 2005: 327). 38. King 1986: 5, v.10.
