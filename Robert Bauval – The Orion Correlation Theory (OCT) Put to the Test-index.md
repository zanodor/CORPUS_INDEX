APPENDIX 2
THE ORION CORRELATION THEORY (OCT): IS IT
REALLY ‘UPSIDE DOWN’? IS IT FALSIFIABLE?
(Robert Bauval)
‘The theory known as “The Orion Correlation Theory” was first proposed by Robert
Bauval... and although the validity of this theory is still disputed, it is at present the
most convincing hypothesis aimed to explain the enigmatic and clearly not due to
simple chance disposition of the Giza pyramids.’ Dr. Giulio Magli, Professor of Applied
Mathematics at Milano Politecnico
‘... the OCT has been subjected to some quantitative astronomical and astrophysical
verifications, in order to assess its compatibility with the results of both naked-eye
astrometry and photometry. In particular, a linear correlation is found between the height of
such monuments and the present brightness of the Orion Belt stars. According to these
analyses it is possible to conclude that the OCT is not incompatible with what expected for
the stars of the Orion Belt on the basis of naked-eye astrometry and photometry, as well as
of the stellar evolution theory.’ Dr. Vincenzo Orofino, Associate Professor, Department of
Mathematics and Physics, University of Salento
How would Orion’s Belt be reproduced on the ground?
In the summer of 1993 I had the honor of befriending the astronomer Dr. Mary Brück
(1925-2008), wife of the eminent German-Scottish Astronomer Royal for Scotland Dr.



2
Hermann Brück (1905-2000). We met in the summer of 1993 when I was in the process
of writing my first book, The Orion Mystery. I had gone to visit the Brücks at their
home in Penicuik Estate near Edinburgh. Mary had offered to help me in my
investigation to find the so-called ‘Dixon Relics’ from the Great Pyramid that had been
brought to Scotland in 1872 by the engineer John Dixon for Piazzi Smyth, the
Astronomer Royal for Scotland at that time [ref: See
http://www.robertbauval.co.uk/articles/articles/DE49.html ]
A2.1: Dr. Mary Brück and Robert Bauval at the Glasgow Science Center, 2001
When in February 1984 the BBC aired the documentary The Great Pyramid: Gateway
to the Stars based on my book The Orion Mystery, Mary was interviewed by the
producer, Chris Mann, to give her opinion on the OCT:
“The layout of the three pyramids, just speaking as an astronomer, is very
reminiscent of the pattern of the three stars as in the Belt of Orion. There’s no



3
question about it. For a start the three pyramids appear to be equidistant just as the
three stars in the constellation of Orion are equidistant, with the third star slightly
offset from the other two and slightly fainter as well just as the third pyramid is
slightly smaller and slightly offset from the line of the other two. It’s certainly a very
intriguing idea, there’s no question about it...’ [ref: BBC2 Everyman program, The
Great Pyramid: Gateway to the stars, February 1994]
Several years later in 1999 when the BBC Horizon aired Atlantis Reborn in which Ed
Krupp made his “upside down” accusation (see appendix 1), Mary, like many other
British astronomers and physicists at the time, protested about the way the BBC had
allowed this unfair accusation to be made with a counterview, and wrote this statement
for the BBC:
‘The layout on the ground of the three pyramids of Giza matches closely the pattern
of the three stars in Orion’s belt i.e. a row of three, the third and most westerly in
both cases being offset slightly anticlockwise from the line of the other two.
Furthermore, the Milky Way, perhaps seen as representing a celestial river Nile, is
east of the constellation of Orion, as the Nile itself is to the east of the Pyramids.
When Orion is on the meridian, the observer who takes a position north of the
pyramids and faces south will see the Belt of Orion directly in front of him in the
sky, with the adjacent part of the Milky Way some distance to the Belt’s left. The
same observer will also see the pyramids in front of him on the ground in a similar
configuration, and the Nile to the left.... The layout of the pyramids (whether by
coincidence or design), may be said to imitate the pattern of the Belt stars.’ [ref:
Statement from Mary Bruck sent to the science editor of The Daily Telegraph, Roger
Highfield, on 7.12.2000]

Similar statements were given by other eminent British astronomers and physicists,
among them Dr. Percy Seymour, professor of Astronomy at Plymouth University;
Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, professor of Astronomy at Cardiff University; Dr.
Archie Roy, professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Glasgow University; Dr. David
Mackay, Regius Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University; and Dr. Chris
Doran of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. It should be obvious that
Krupp’s peculiar manner of seeing the OCT was not accepted by astronomers who were
far more senior than himself. However, and notwithstanding the possible ulterior
motives that might have spurred Krupp (viz. CSICOP and CMI) to attempt this
debunking against the OCT, let us try and understand the technical reason behind
Krupp’s accusation.
Is north ‘up’ or ‘down’?
The question why north is at the top of modern maps is often raised. From a purely
scientific viewpoint, since the earth is globe in space then any direction can be
considered ‘up’ or, for that matter, also ‘down’. From an observer’s viewpoint ‘up’ is
directly above his/her head, technically called the zenith. The reason that today north is
placed at the top of a map is because of a convention and not a geographical or
astronomical reality. This convention could as easily have had south, east or west as
‘up’. Bearing this in mind, let us now see what Krupp really meant by ‘turning Egypt
upside down’.
Imagine being an observer at Giza looking south. In this case north is directly behind
you. Now imagine looking at Orion’s Belt when it is south in 10,500 BCE. You would
see Orion very low on the south horizon almost ‘touching’ the earth. Now focus your
attention on the topmost star of Orion’s Belt, Mintaka. It is still south, right? Well, not



5
according to Krupp, who says this star is north because if you extend a line upwards
from the star and loop it over your head and down behind you, you can say that the top
of top part of Orion’s Belt is facing north. This only would be true if the sky was a
sphere over the earth which, of course, it is not. Well, it could be argued that it would
still be true if you would visualize that the sky was a sphere. But there is no evidence
that the ancient Egyptian did visualize the sky this way. Indeed, Ed Krupp himself
affirmed that the Egyptian did not visualize the sky as a sphere! In Krupp’s own words:
“There is... no evidence from antiquity to verify that such detailed conventions of
spherical geometry and their imposition on the sky are any older than perhaps the
fourth or fifth century BCE when they appear in Greece. While it is possible these
notions were extant in the Mediterranean in a slightly earlier era, what we know of
Egyptian cosmology suggests the sky was not visualized as a sphere...’
(http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=1&i=98581&t=98581&v=f ]



6
A2.2: Orion’s Belt low in south in 10,500 BC.
A2.2b: Krupp’s “you have to turn Egypt upside down” as shown on BBC Horizon
Atlantis Reborn Again. According to Krupp the sky must be ‘folded down’ over the
pyramids.



7
The fallacy of Krupp’s reasoning (assuming it wasn’t just CSICOP style debunking)
was pointed out by various astronomers and physicists, including Dr. Percy Seymour of
Plymouth University:
‘Dr. Krupp has fallen into the trap that many modern astronomers encounter when
they try to fit ancient concepts and beliefs concerning the cosmos, into the
procrustean bed of modern science. He has overlooked the fact that to the ancient
Egyptians the earth was not a sphere surrounded by another ---the celestial sphere.’
[Ref: Dr. Percy Seymour’s rebuttal supplied for the BBC Horizon, 24 November
2000]
In other words, Dr. Seymour was reminding Dr. Krupp that to the Egyptians did not
base themselves on modern mapping convention or use spherical geometry projections.
Still, let me try at least to explain what Krupp had in mind (other than obviously
debunking the OCT). According to Krupp, in order to have the stars of Orion’s Belt
match the Giza Pyramids you would first have to perceive the sky as sphere covering
the earth, then flip down the sky onto the ground, then imagine yourself behind those



8
stars and looking down onto the ground.
A2.2a: From Joseph Bieniasz, Griffith Observatory
A recent diagram made by Joseph Bieniasz of the Griffith Observatory for Dr. Krupp’s
entry in the Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy clearly shows a
spherical sky being flipped over a spherical sky, with the perspective looking down
from behind the stars [ref: Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy, edited
by Clive L.N. Ruggles, Springer, New York, 2015, p.275.].
Hold on. Krupp has an explanation to this:
“Bauval may claim that my complaint about his use of spherical astronomy is
contradicted by my earlier arguments about the inversion of Giza with respect to the
sky. This is not so. All of the earlier arguments about cardinal directions and the
local meridian remain in force. The sky does not have to be spherical to uphold the
validity of my challenge on inverted directionality."



9
What does Krupp mean exactly by ‘inverted directionality’? Well, according to Krupp
we must take into account the shafts emanating from the King’s Chamber and Queen’s
Chamber. His reasoning, again fallacious, is that the northern shafts point north and the
southern shafts point south, this confirms to him that the ancient Egyptians knew where
north was and where south. So according to Krupp, for the OCT to work, one has to
‘turn Egypt upside down’. But then Krupp admits that,
‘.. if [Bauval] had not endorse the astronomical meaning of the airshafts, which locks
the pyramid’s sides to particular directions, my [upside down] complaint would not
hold...[his] argument is contradictory and flawed in other details through arbitrary
data selection...’ [ref: Krupp to Ivan Verheyden, editor of Revue Kadath, 11
October 1997]
First let us be clear on one point: no-one, as far as I know, is ‘endorsing the
‘astronomical meaning of the shafts’. The shafts did have an astronomical meaning
because, quite simply, they emanate from the chamber in a horizontal direction for a
few meters then turn upwards, making it impossible from them to use for astronomical
observations. All Egyptologists and pyramid researchers that the meaning of the shafts
was symbolic, to send the soul of the departed king to his afterlife stellar destinations.
The symbolic function of the shafts was proposed in 1964 by astronomer Virginia
Trimble and Egyptologist Alexander Badawy [ref: Virginia Trimble, ‘Astronomical
investigation concerning the so-called Air-shafts of Cheops's Pyramid’, in Mitteilungen
der Institut Fur Orientforschung, Band x, Heft 2/3. pp.183-7, 1964]. And widely
accepted by Egyptologists and astronomers including Krupp himself who, in 1983,
wrote that,



10
‘These celestial alignments [of the shafts] don’t make an observatory out of the Great
Pyramid, for neither Thuban nor Orion could actually be seen through the shafts
openings inside the King’s Chamber. Both shafts bend horizontally for a short
distance before they reach the King’s Chamber and also at their other ends prior to
opening on the north and south face of the pyramid. The shafts are symbolic
references to the pharaoh’s celestial destinies...’ [ref: Krupp, E. Echoes of Ancient
Skies, Oxford University Press 1994 ed., p.105]
A2.2c: From Ed Krupp, 1983. The caption clearly acknowledges the symbolic function
of the shafts.
In 1990 I proposed a similar symbolism meaning for the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber,
offering that they southern one was aimed at Sirius and the northern one aimed at
Kochab in Ursa Minor [ref: Robert G. Bauval, ‘The seeding of the star-gods: a fertility
rite inside Cheop's Pyramid?’ in Discussion In Egyptology vol. 16, 1990, pp. 21-5].
Having said this, I cannot see how this makes my supporting arguments for the OCT
‘contradictory and flawed in other details through arbitrary data selection’ as claimed by



11
Krupp. As an aside, let us note that even Krupp’s ardent supporter, the astronomer Dr.
Anthony Fairall, who also offered his services to the BBC Horizon on the Atlantis
Reborn documentary to debunk the OCT, nonetheless was compelled to admit ‘that the
North-South reversal argument detracts from the key criticism, and Ed Krupp seems to
push it too far.’ [ref: Correspondence from Dr. Fairall to author Ian Lawton, 18
February 2000]. Dr. Fairall was honest enough to add that:
‘The counter argument [to Krupp’s view] is, however, well known in astronomy.
Directions are flipped when a plan laid on a table is instead held above one’s head or
vice-versa. If one looked south from Egypt and viewed Orion above the Southern
horizon (when it is at its highest) and then swung down the view about and east west
west line, it would match the sense of the pyramid layout.’ [ref:
www.museums.org.za/sam/planet/pyramids.htm ]
An archaeoastronomer from Finland, Christopher Tedder, put it even more clearly:
‘In the context of representing the 'belt' stars on the ground, the idea that 'up' is north
is inconsistent with the compass directions for east and west. If 'up' is north, and
'down' is south, then right is to the east and west is to the left, according to modern
compass convention. However, when looking at the 'belt' due south, to the right is
west not east. East and west are reversed if 'up' is north. It is far more natural to
describe the scene as particular stars being simply above or below other
stars. [Miroslav] Verner mentions that south was the important direction for the
ancient Egyptians. (The AE [ancient Egyptians] seemed to equate west with right and
east with left, and this is only correct if looking south.) They would have represented
the 'belt' according to their design conventions, as it seemed most clear and natural.
[ref: Chris Tedder http://www.kolumbus.fi/lea.tedder/OKAD/sky2475.htm ]



12
What Tedder meant is that when looking at Orion’s Belt as it sits in the south meridian,
east is on the left and west is on the right. This means that above Orion’s Belt must
‘south’ or, to be precise, ‘up’. For ‘up’ to be ‘north’ in this case, you must stand behind
the stars looking down on the earth, which is a totally unnatural way from a natural way
of reproducing the star on the ground. Here is an explanation made by Dr. Dominique
Gorlitz, an experimental archaeologist and specialist in ancient navigation and charts
using naked-eye stellar course-plotting:
“I have a PhD in experimental archaeologist and I am a professional navigator. I am
the founder of the ABORA Project which studies ancient seafaring cultures, their
maps and methods of navigation in the open sea. When consulting a sky-map it is
totally acceptable and natural to place the top of the map such that it faces the
direction of observation to compare the constellations drawn on the map as they
appear in the actual sky. Accordingly, I have carefully reviewed the criticism of Dr.
Edwin Krupp regarding the Orion Correlation Theory (OCT) and find it totally
unfounded and pedantic.” [ref: Personal communication from Dr. Dominique Gorlitz
23 March 2015]
[BOX. Quotes from Egyptologists about the ‘south’ in Ancient Egypt.
“It is now time to consider the terms in which the Egyptian viewed the physical
universe... He took his orientation from the Nile River, the source of his life. He faced
the South, from which the stream came. One of the terms for ‘south’ is also a term for
‘face’; the usual word for ‘north’ is probably related to a word which means ‘back of the
head’. On his left was the east and on his right was the west. The word for ‘east’ and
‘left’ is the same, and the word for ‘west’ and ‘right’ is the same.” [ref: Frankfort, Henri



13
& Wilson, John A. Before Philosophy, The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man,
Penguin Books, 1961, p. 51].
“...South was the most important direction for ancient Egyptians.” [ref: Verner,
Niroslav. The Pyramids. Grove press, NY 2001, p. 184]
“If we look at the map...with south at the top as the Egyptians viewed their world.”
[ref: Lehner, Mark. The Complete Pyramids, op. cit. p. 82]
"Contrary to modern usage the Ancient Egyptians orientated themselves to face
southwards. At their back lay the Mediterranean and the rest of the ancient world. The
west was for them the right, and the east the left." [ref: Plumley, J.M. Ancient
cosmologies, Carmen Blacker and Michael Loewe (eds.), George Allen & Unwin Ltd.,
London, 1975 p. 19).
‘...the Egyptians orientated themselves towards the south...for example, the Turin gold
mine map and a representation of the world on a Dynasty 30 coffin in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, show the south at the top and the north at the bottom..’

15
A2.4: view of Orion’s Belt from ‘behind the star’ as proposed by Krupp.
An Angle of Contention
Now let us deal with another argument against the OCT put by Krupp’s counterpart in
South Africa: Dr. Anthony Fairall, astronomer and director of the Cape Town
Planetarium.



16
A2.5: Dr. Anthony Fairall.
Any discussion how the ancient Egyptian might have reproduced Orion’s Belt on the
Giza Plateau must be considered in the context of the epoch and the means available to
the builders. Unless otherwise proven, we must take it that the ancient builders did not
have high precision optical instruments or star-charts with coordinates to the nearest
arc-second, or astronomy computer software, or planetariums with projectors, or
knowledge of spherical geometry. We must assume that they had only the most basic
and rudimentary of instruments to perform this complex task and that all observations
were made with the naked-eye.
There are nine operations involved:
(1).Establish a meridian on the ground (2) Measure the angle the three belt stars
make with with the sky meridian (3) Transfer this angle on the ground meridian;
(4) Measure the relative distance of the three belt stars to each other (5) Measure
the angle offset of the smallest (less bright) star Mintaka from the line joining
the other two stars (6) Transfer all measurements on the ground (7) Extend
measurements to the required scale in order to mark the center points each



17
pyramid (8) Set out the square bases of each pyramid; 9. Begin the construction
of the Pyramids.
Operation 1: This entails setting out a north-south line on the ground. Several methods
have been proposed by researchers for this purpose. Perhaps the most likely were using
the shadow of the sun at noon or bisecting the rising and setting point of the sun on the
same day; alternatively, using the rising and setting of a star [ref: Isler, Martin. Sticks,
Stones, and Shadows. University of Oklahoma Press, 2001, pp.158-170]. This north
south line (meridian or longitude) will eventually pass through the center of the Great
Pyramid. This center-point on the north-south line would then be fixed, possibly with a
stone slab serving as datum (datum 1).
Operation 2: This entails measuring the angle that Orion’s Belt makes with the sky
meridian. This is possibly the most tricky but crucial operation, because it must be
carried out while Orion’s Belt is ‘moving’ clockwise at the rate of about 15 ̊ per hour.
Also bearing in mind the relatively small ‘apparent size’ of Orion’s Belt which is only
2 ̊ 44’ in angular length --roughly 30 millimeters when measured with hand outstretch.



18
A2.6: The apparent ‘size’ of Orion’s Belt as seen with the naked eye and ‘sized’ with
hand outstretched.
The way this operation was probably attempted was with a wooden rod to simulate the
meridian, and attached to it a small sliding rule that could also rotate clockwise. The
measurement, of course, will have to be done at night. It is difficult to see how this
operation could be achieved with less than +- 5o error in angular rotation.



19
A2.7/A2.8: Orion’s Belt rotated 5o clockwise (left right). This change takes place in
20 minutes.
Operation 3: This entails transferring the angle of Orion’s Belt with the meridian on
the ground. This could be achieved by placing the wooden rod over the north-south line
and datum 1, then marking another datum (Datum 2). Here too, it would be unrealistic
to expect an accuracy of less than 2o in angular rotation.
++Operation 4: This entailed measuring the ‘apparent’ distance of the tree Belt stars
relative to each other. Using the naked eye only, it can be seen that the middle star,
Alnilam, in Orion’s Belt is equidistant to the other two stars. Trying to ‘measure’ this
with rudiment instruments in the dark would not produce a better estimate.
Operation 5: This entails measuring the angle offset between the top star, Mintaka, and
the middle star, Al Nilam, in Orion’s Belt. It can be estimated with the naked eye that
this offset is anything between 5o to 10o in angular rotation. Again as in (4), trying to
measure this angle at night with rudimentary instruments will not produce a better
estimate.
A2.4: Orion’s Belt: Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka



20
Operations 6 to 9: These operations entail setting out the three pyramids according to a
‘map’. This ‘map’ would either have been drawing on the ground in small scale, or
drawn on a papyrus or similar flat surface. The setting out operation would, again, be
done with non-optical sighting and measuring instruments. In such conditions, and
taking into account the great distances involved (some 976 meters between the first and
third Khufu pyramids), clearly a reasonable tolerance error must be assumed. The scale
between 1 : 32,530 i.e. converting the (apparent) 30 millimeters ‘distance’ between the
stars Alnitak and Mintaka of Orion’s Belt to the 976,000 millimeters between the first
and third pyramid of Giza. I would not expect an accuracy of less than 1o or 2o in
angular projection.
Taking all nine operations into account, and the conditions that these would be carried
out, a minimum tolerance of 5o for angular positioning of the pyramids would be a
reasonable value. It is one thing theorizing how all nine operations on paper, but quite
another thing to actually perform these operations. Fairall has calculate the angles using
tables giving declinations and Right Ascension of the stars to the nearest arc-second that
were obtained with high-precision optical instruments. As Dr. Wickramasinghe,
Professor of Applied Mathematics and Astronomy at Cardiff University, realistically
pointed out: “Any slight mismatch of relative ratios or angles which there may have
been is in my view less important than the overall similarity of disposition [of Orion’s
Belt and the Giza Pyramids] which would have been unmistakable.” [ref: Dr. Chandra
Wikramasinghe’s response to the BBC horizon Atlantis Reborn program, 11 June 2001]
My own view is that the ancient builders of Giza set out the three pyramids on the
following criteria:



21
1. The relative distances between the three stars: from naked eye observations it
was accepted that the middle star, Alnilam is equidistant from the other two
stars.
2. The near 45o angle of Orion’s Belt with the sky meridian was represented on the
ground by the 45o line passing through the northeast and southwest diagonal of
the Great Pyramid.
3. The offset of the third pyramid: this was estimated with naked eye to be about
10o
Ignoring for the moment the angle made with the meridian (2), when we compare the
positioning of the three pyramids of Giza with those of the three stars of Orion’s Belt
using Right Ascensions and Declinations obtained with high precision optical
instruments, the position of Mintaka is found to be near the west edge of the third
pyramid. In consideration of the combined error tolerances for the nine operations, this
is as good as spot on.
A2.10/A2.11: The positioning of the three stars of Orion’s Belt over the pyramids.



22
Now let us look at the correlation when the angle with the meridian is taken into
account. First let us see what exactly was said on the BBC Horizon documentary
Atlantis Reborn on this issue:
Narrator: ‘In June 1999 astronomer Anthony Fairall made another discovery. He re
examined the 45 degree angle that seemed to link the pyramid with the stars. Fairall
found that the match is not as precise as originally claimed. The angle of the pyramids is
38 degrees, and that of the stars is 50 degrees...’
The angle 38o given by Fairall was not, of course, ‘discovered’ by Fairall, as the BBC
seemed to have implied, nor was it measured by Fairall, but culled (and rounded up)
from the survey made by Flinders Petrie in 1881, and published in 1883 in his book The
Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, where it is stated:
‘The relative positions of the three larger Pyramids to one another were completely
fixed in the triangulation, which included them all. The following are their distances
apart, as measured on parallels inclined – 5' to true N i.e., at the mean azimuth of the
First and Second Pyramids; and also the distances, and the angles from these parallels,
of the direct lines from one Pyramid to another: Center of First to center of Third
Pyramid ...... 37o 51’ 6”....’
As for the angle 50o given by Fairall for the Belt stars, this was presumably calculated
or measured off the planetarium screen. The BBC obtained them from Fairall’s article in
the Astronomy and Geophysical (GA) magazine of June 1999:
‘My [Fairall’s] own investigation shows that while the line of the two outer pyramids
is set at 38o from north., the angle of Orion’s Belt to north in 10,500 BCE is close on
50o! Hardly an exact match. I calculate that circular precessional [sic] motion would



23
give 47o, whereas including nutational [sic] terms makes it slightly higher.’ [ref:
Anthony Fairall, ‘Precession and the Layout of the Ancient Egyptian Pyramids’ in
Astronomy & Geophysical (GA) vol.40, June 1999].
[BOX. An Exact Fit
In my book The Egypt Code I have shown that an “exactly fit” for the OCT would
occur at c. 11,450 BCE, using the “First Time” of the star Sirius as seen from the
latitude of Giza as well as the so-called Sothic Cycle (Bauval. The Egypt Code, pp.
64-5). But there will always be a level of uncertainty not only due to the unknown
effect of nutation and the precise effect of proper motion of the stars, but also on the
accuracy of the method used by the ancients and whether the measurements were
make exactly at meridian. The reasonable position to take is that the same correlation
could hold from c. 9500 BC to 11,500 BC, the average being 10,500 BC which falls
exactly at the nadir of Orion’s Belt and also when it position at the meridian
coincides the vernal equinox point on the east horizon, the winter solstice point at the
south meridian and the autumnal equinox point at the west horizon. The imagery in
the sky in 10,500 BC not only has a symbolic counterpart on the ground but also
combines three major points of the solar year. CLOSE BOX]
In a correspondence with the author Ian Lawton, Fairall however admitted that,
“My 50 degree angle is a rounded off value –I initially measured it from the
planetarium projector. Subsequent calculations assuming circular precession put it
closer to 48o, but there will always be some uncertainly due to the unknown effect of



24
nutation. Planetarium and most computer programs assume circular precession which
is a reasonable approximation. I would still like to look into proper motion, but I
have assumed negligible.’ [ref: Fairall to Lawton, 18 February 2000]
The matter of this angle gets even more confusing when a year later the BBC re
broadcasted the program on the 14 December 2000 and changed somewhat the texts to
explain how this angle was measured:
Narrator: ‘‘In June 1999 astronomer Anthony Fairall made another discovery. He re
examined the 45 degree angle that seemed to link the pyramid with the stars as they
were in 10,500 BCE. Fairall found that the match is not as precise as originally claimed.
The angle formed by the two large pyramids is 45o; but the angle formed by the Belt
stars is 54o.’
As far as I know the angle of 54o is not mentioned in any of Fairall publications or
correspondence. Fairall did comment that ‘if one restricts the debate to only two
pyramids, then a fit is possible.... [but] if only two stars and two pyramids are involved,
I felt the argument [against Bauval] was much weaker...’ [ref: Fairall to Lawton, 8
March 2000]. But such a statement was not, of course, used by the BBC.
[BOX: Dr. Anthony Fairall (1943-2008)
Dr. Anthony Fairall drowned in a tragic diving accident off the coast of Cape Town in
South Africa on 23rd November 2008. Through the years I have come to suspect that
more than the OCT itself, it was its widespread popularity in the international media
that solicited animosity with some academics. Fairall introduced his article in the Royal
Astronomical Society’s journal Astronomy and Geophysics (AG) with words that seem
to harbor such animosity:



25
‘Many members of the public have been captivated by recent books and video
presentations concerning the pyramids and Sphinx of ancient Egypt. Books by
Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval.’
While the journal itself introduced Fairall’s article with the shout phrase: “Anthony
Fairall takes a hard look at some recent, well publicized claims about astronomical
alignment of the pyramids” (ref: Astronomy and Geophysics (AG) 1999, volume 40 (3)
3.4). To my astonishment, Fairall’s opinion was later mentioned in his obituary written
by one of his colleagues, Dr. Patrick A. Woudt:
“In style with his character, Fairall rarely had a harsh word of criticism about the work
of colleagues. A noticeable exception was when he entered a popular discussion
regarding the astronomical significance of the alignment of the Egyptian pyramids,
refuting some of the claims made by two authors, Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval.
In correspondence with them, Fairall wrote: ‘It is the claim regarding the 10 500 BCE
date that I dispute on astronomical grounds. While I cannot say I approve of the manner
in which this material has been conveyed to a public audience, I do recognize that it has
brought about considerable interest in both pyramids and stars.’ (ref: Astronomy &
Geophysics, Volume 50, Issue 3, pp. 3.38-3.38) ]
(Note: Fairall’s correspondence alluded to by Dr. Woudt was not with Hancock or
myself, but to one of his friends in Cape town
[http://www.antiquityofman.com/Fairall_response.html ] CLOSE BOX]
I thing we have said enough of the ‘upside down’ and ‘mismatched angles’. The truth is
that no-one, nor even Krupp or Fairall, knows how the ancient Egyptians would have



26
reproduced Orion’s Belt on the ground into a monumental architectural plan. The matter
must be left with the words of Dr. Mary Brück which I will quote again:
‘The layout of the three pyramids, just speaking as an astronomer, is very
reminiscent of the pattern of the three stars as in the Belt of Orion. There’s no
question about it...it certainly a very intriguing idea, there’s no question about it. But
I think we would have to go back in the minds of the ancient Egyptians to know
whether in fact that’s what they intended to do.’ [ref: BBC2 ‘The Great Pyramid:
Gateway to the Stars’, February 1994]

The correct way to evaluate the OCT using the correct scientific analytical method is
by subjecting it to (1) quantitative analysis, and (2) as a statistical analysis.
THE QUANTITATIVE ASTRONOMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE OCT:
Dr. Vicenzo Orofino, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has examined the
OCT and presented the following paper titled “A quantitative astronomical analysis of
the Orion Correlation Theory” with the following summary:
“In the present paper the OCT has been subjected to some quantitative astronomical and
astrophysical verification in order to assess its compatibility with the results of both naked
eye astrometry and photometry. In particular, a linear correlation is found between the
height of such monuments and the present brightness of the Orion Belt stars. According to
these analyses it is possible to conclude that the OCT is not incompatible with what
expected for the stars of the Orion Belt on the basis of naked-eye astrometry and
photometry, as well as of the stellar evolution theory.” [Dr. Vincenzo’s paper can be seen

THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE OCT:
A second paper was also presented by Dr. Vincenzo Orofino in collaboration with
Dr.Paolo Bernardini titled “A statistical analysis of the archaeological site of Giza,
Egypt”:
Since long time various qualitative speculations have been proposed about the link
between the three major Giza pyramids and the stars. In particular, according to a
popular and controversial theory, a perfect coincidence would exist between the mutual

positions of the three stars of the Orion Belt and those of the main Giza pyramids. In the
present paper this apparent coincidence has been subjected to some statistical
verifications, in order to assess the probability that the correlation between stars and
pyramids, both in relative position and in luminosity/height, can be merely due to the
case. These statistical analyses have been performed by means of Monte Carlo
simulations and have been coupled with previous astronomical/astrophysical tests of the
presumed correlation, finding that it is compatible with the naked-eye astrometry and
photometry of the Orion Belt stars and that the coincidence does not seem to be
fortuitous....The simplest version of the OCT (correspondence limited only to Orion
Belt stars and Giza pyramids) is compatible with what expected for the stars of the
Orion Belt on the basis of naked-eye astrometry and photometry, as well as of the stellar
evolution theory. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the above cited correlation can be
fortuitous. Therefore, there are no astronomical /astrophysical and statistical arguments
to reject the hypothesis that the main Giza pyramids would be the monumental
reproduction on the ground of the Orion Belt.’
