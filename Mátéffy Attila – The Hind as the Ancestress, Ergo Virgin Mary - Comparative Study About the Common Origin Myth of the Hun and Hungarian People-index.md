The Hind as the Ancestress, Ergo Virgin Mary
Comparative Study About the Common Origin
Myth of the Hun and Hungarian People
Attila Mátéffya
Abstract
Numerous legends are known in Eurasia, in which one or more hunters are trying to get a stag, and then the hunters will find
a new homeland, or establish a new cathedral at the location where the deer appeared earlier. According to the structure of
the legend, the Eastern legend type is more ancient. In its most archaic version the sole hero spots a doe, who later turns out
to be the daughter of a king, later marrying the hero and then they found a new homeland where his people may reproduce.
This totemic tradition of the origins can be seen in the Hungarian myths of origin, as well as in the oral ritual texts related to
wedding ceremonies which connect Central Eurasia with Europe through the Hun origin myths. The doe appearing in the
Eastern Legends is the symbol of the Sun and the ancestress of the culture hero’s nation. And this symbolic role descends to
the cultural heritage of the Christian era later in the person of Virgin Mary. The aim of the paper is to find whether there are
any correspondences between the two branches and if there are, the sort is to be determined; furthermore, the purposes of
the Hungarian legends are to be sought out about the Miracle Stag in possible relation to the deer legends on the two
continents linked together by the Eurasian steppes.

The mythologies about deer chases1 and dramatic rites
are widely spread throughout the world: from Japan to
the British Isles (Berze Nagy 1927: 5). The ancient
Greek legends are one of the major groups of these
myths: the story of Heracles and the Doe of Kerynia
by Apollodorus (Mythographer, 180-120 BC) and
Pindaros (ca. 518-438 BC). Sozomenus (ca. 400-ca.
450 AD) was the first who wrote down the deer
chasing mythologies of the Hun people living on the
steppes north of the Black Sea, after him based on the
lost eight volume work Priscus Rhetor (the fifth
century; ca. 410/420-after 472 AD), Procopius of
Caesarea (ca. 500-ca. 565 AD) wrote about the deer
chasing myths of the Utigur and Kutrigur Huns.
Jordanes (the sixth century), also used the works of
Priscos. In the present analysis the author discusses
the folkloristic links of the mythological tale
collections brought to Europe by the Hun people. The
history of the Huns originates from Central Eurasia
back to prehistoric times. Until the fifth century no
link can be verified between the Hun and the ancient

Greek and Byzantine mythologies. From the medieval
Hungarian chronicles five different versions of
legends about deer hunt may be found. The earliest
survived version of the Hungarian Miracle Stag myth
is ascribed to Simon from Kéza. His chronicle, the
Gesta Hungarorum was written in 1282-1285 and
bears the marks of mixed genres. Different versions of
this legend were told in the chronicles structured in
Latin in the fourteenth century (Chronicon Hungariae
Pictum; Vienna Illuminated Chronicle, ca. 1358), the
chronicle János Thuróczy published in 1488
(Chronica Hungarorum), and the Tārīh-i Ungurus
(Deeds of the Hungarians) which was translated into
Ottoman Turkish (from one or several Latin described
Hungarian chronicles by Tercumān Mahmūd) after it
managed to survive the Osman siege of
Székesfehérvár (Hungary) in 1543. The authors of the
chronicles about the Hungarian Árpád dynasty (Turul
dynasty)2 (ca. the ninth century-1301) did use the
aforementioned works of Jordanes, but as the
remarkable textual differences, Berze Nagy (1927:
160-164), a mythologist and folklorist, also proved
that the legend of the origin of the Hungarian people
was not copied. The myth of the Hungarian origin
dates back to oral traditions which the author will later
prove with examples.
SUBSISTED EXTRACTS IN ANCIENT GREEK AND LATIN FROM SOURCE TEXTS IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION
Salaminius Hermias Sozomenus: The Ecclesiastical History, Book VI—Chap. XXXVII (Concerning the Barbarians Beyond the Danube, Who Were Driven Out by the Huns; ...)͵
The Huns, it is said, were unknown to the Thracians of the Ister and the Goths before this period; for though they were dwelling secretly near to one another, a lake of vast extent was between them, and the inhabitants on each side of the lake respectively imagined that their own country was
situated at the extremity of the earth, and that there was nothing beyond them but the sea and water. It so happened, however, that an ox, tormented by insects, plunged into the lake, and was pursued by the herdsman; who, perceiving for the first time that the opposite bank was inhabited, made known the circumstance to his fellow-tribesmen. Some, however, relate that a stag was fleeing, and showed some of the hunters who were of the race of the Hurts the way which was concealed superficially by the water. On arriving at the opposite bank, the hunters were struck with the beauty of the country, the serenity of the air, and the adaptedness for cultivation; and they reported what they had seen to their king...
Procopius of Caesaerea: History of the Wars: Books Viii (The Gothic War)Ͷ
In ancient times a vast throng of the Huns who were then called Cimmerians ranged over this region which I have just mentioned, and one king had authority over them all. And at one time the power was secured by a certain man to whom two sons were born, one of whom was named Utigur and the other Cutrigur. These two sons, when their father came to the end of his life, divided the power between them, and each gave his own name to his subjects; for the one group has been called Utigurs and the other Cutrigurs even to my time. All these now continued to live in this region, associating freely in all the business of life, but not mingling with the people who were settled ont he other side of the lake and its outlet; for they never crossed these waters at any time nor did they suspect that they could be crossed, being fearful of that which was really easy, simply because they had never even attempted to cross them, and they remained utterly ignorant of the possibility. Now beyond the Maeotic Lake and the outlet flowing from itt he first people were the Goths called Tetraxitae, whom I have just mentioned, who in ancient times lived close along the shore of this strait; but the Goths and the Visigoths and Vandals were located far away from them as were other Gothic nations. These Tetraxitae were called also Scythians in ancient times, because all the nations who held these regions are called in general Scythians, while a few of them had an additional designation such as Sauromatae or Melanchlaenae or something else. But as time went on, they say (if, indeed, the story is sound), some youths of the Cimmerians were engaged in hunting, and a single doe which was fleeing before them leaped into these waters. And the youths, either moved by a thirst for glory or in some sort of competition, or perhaps it was really some deity which constrained them, followed

after this doe and refused absolutely tol et her go, until they came with her to the opposite shore. And then the quarry, whatever it was, immediately disappeared from sight; for in my opinion it appeared there for no other purpose than that evil might befall the barbarians who lived int hat region. Thus, while the youths did fail in their hunt, they found an incentive to battle and plunder. For they returned as fast as they could to their own land, and thus made it clear to all the Cimmerians that these waters could be crossed by them...
Jordanes: The Origin and Deeds of the Gothsͷ
XXIV (122) ... Such was the descent of the Huns who came to the country of the Goths. (123) This cruel tribe, as Priscus the historian relates, settled on the farther bank of the Maeotic swamp. They were fond of hunting and had no skill in any other art. After they had grown to a nation, they disturbed the peace of neighboring races by theft and rapine. At one time, while hunters of their tribe were as usual seeking for game on the farthest edge of Maeotis, they saw a doe unexpectedly appear to their sight and enter the swamp, acting as guide of the way; now advancing and again standing still. (124) The hunters followed and crossed on foot the Maeotic swamp, which they had supposed was impassable as the sea. Presently the unknown land of Scythia disclosed itself and the doe disappeared. Now in my opinion the evil spirits, from whom the Huns are descended, did this from envy of the Scythians. (125) And the Huns, who had been wholly ignorant that there was another world beyond Maeotis, were now filled with admiration for the Scythian land. As they were quick of mind, they believed that this path, utterly unknown to any age of the past, had been divinely revealed to them. They returned to their tribe, told them what had happened, praised Scythia and persuaded the people to hasten thither along the way they had found by the guidance of the doe. As many as they captured, when they thus entered Scythia for the first time, they sacrificed to Victory. The remainder they conquered and made subject to themselves. (126) Like a whirlwind of nations they swept across the great swamp and at once fell upon the Alpidzuri, Alcildzuri, Itimari, Tuncarsi and Boisci, who bordered on that part of Scythia. The Alani also, who were their equals in battle, but unlike them in civilization, manners and appearance, they exhausted by their incessant attacks and subdued.
Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians (Gesta Hungarorum)
After the confusion of tongues the giant entered the land of
Havilah, which is now called Persia, and there he begot two sons, Hunor and Mogor, by his wife Eneth. It was from them that the Huns, or Hungarians, took their origins. However, it seems the giant Ménrót had other wives apart from Eneth, on whom he sired many sons and daughters besides of Hunor and Mogor. These sons and their posterity inhabit the land of Persia and resemble the Hun sin stature and colour, merely differing a little in speech, like the Saxons and the Thuringians. But as Hunor and Mogor were Ménrót’s first born, they journeyed separately from their father in tents. Now it happened one day when they had gone out hunting in the Meotis marshes that they encountered a hind in the wilderness. As they went in pursuit of it, it fled before them. Then it disappeared from their sight altogether, and they could not find it no matter how long they searched. But as they were wandering through these marshes, they saw that the land was well suited for grazing cattle. They then returned to their father, and after obtaining his permission they took all their possessions and went to live int he Meotis marshes. The Meotis region borders on their Persian homeland, and except from one very small ford it is cut of fon all sides by the sea; it has no rivers but abounds in grass, trees, birds, fish, and animals; access and exit to this land is difficult. So they entered the Meotis marshes and remained there for five years without leaving. Then in the sixth year they went out, and when by chance they discovered that the wives and children of the sons of Belar were camped in tents in a lonely place without their menfolk, they carried them off with all their belongings as fast as they could into the Meotis marshes. Two daughters of Dula, prince of the Alans, happened to be among the children who were seized. Hunor took one of them in marriage and Mogor the other, and to these women all the Huns owe their origin. And as they stayed on in the marshes, they gradually grew into a very powerful people, and the land was not large enough to contain them or to feed them. (Veszprémy and Schaer 1999: 15-17)
These are only the oldest written recordings of a
Central Eurasian myth collection, not the most archaic
texts. Through oral heritage, this mythological core
managed to survive for several thousands of years in
many different versions throughout Central Eurasia,
mostly in nomadic societies, preceding even these
without ever being recorded.
For summarizing the aforementioned, here is a
brief list about the locations of these myths:

ANALYZING FEATURES AND COMPARING TEXTS
After examining the international body of myths, it
may be determined that the deer chasing legends have
five major features:
(1) A princely person chases a doe;
(2) He cannot shoot it down;
(3) The doe appears as a daughter of a king;
(4) They get married (Totemic wedding);
(5) It falls to the prince who becomes the
forefather of his nation (and founds a new homeland).
The first feature provides the basis for the whole
group of myths, this is the reason why it can be found
in all of the texts analyzed before. This however has a
sub-feature: when the stag is being pursued by two
people. The sub-feature is one of the most important
indicators of which tales are in connection with each
other, giving an answer for the trail where the living
folkloric texts spread.
The Two Brothers6 (Sub-Feature)
The two oldest siblings can also be found as Hunor
and Magyar (Magor) in the Hungarian version. In the
legend present in the Chronicum Pictum, a chronicle
about Hungarians in Latin (1358), the Hungarian
Árpád dynasty had two kings, King Géza (1044-1077;
reigned: 1074-1077) and his brother King Ladislaus I
of Hungary (Saint László) (1046-1095; reigned:
1077-1095), the two pursuing brothers. The
sub-feature of the two brothers can basically be found
in the origin myths of the Turkic peoples7. In the
works of the gothic historian Jordanes, the two
brothers are substituted by “hunters”. In the case of
Prokopios, Utigur and Kutrigur are two brothers who
are the two sons of a king, namely of the “Cimmerian”
king, who will become the heads of the two nations,
Utigurs and Kutrigurs, just as Hunor and Magyar of
the Huns and Hungarians (Magyars). But the
difference from which it can be seen that the
Hungarian historian Simon of Kéza did not copy the
myth from here, is that in Pokopios’ version the
pursuers of the stag are not two brothers, but the
“Young of Cimmeria”. Zoltán Gombocz writes that in
the writings of Theophanes Isauricus (†817/8) and



Mátéffy ͻͶͷ
Nicephoros Patriarch (†829), a discussion can be read
about the wandering of the five sons of the Bulgarian
khan Kuvrat. According to Gombocz (1921: 15-16),
both of them used the same sources. The curiosum of
the text is that the Maeotis swamps are mentioned,
and that one of the five sons, Kotrag, the
representative of the Kutrigurs, wanders across the
Tanais with his people. And Kuvrat is also on the
ancient Bulgarian list of kings, as the son of Irnik, in
other words, the grandson of Attila. A description of
another pair of brothers can be found in the copies of
Malalas from the eleventh century, copied from the
chronicles of Gordas and Muageris (around 530 AD)
from the sixth century who are the leaders of the Huns
of the Scythia region (Moravcsik 1927: 260). The
aforementioned person might be the source of the
name of the Hungarians according to the very
convincing researcher Moravcsik (1927: 258-271),
who is involved in Byzantine studies. Szabó (1873:
155-156) was the first who saw that this king might be
the name giving ancient of the Hungarians, and his
views were shared by Thúry (1896: 913-915) as well.
Among the traditions of the nomad nations from the
steppes, this name giving custom that a nation inherits
the name of one historic hero, is widely spread. For
further information, see: Seljuq, Osman, Uzbek, etc.
which according to the author’s opinion is a flawless
interpretation of the origins of the “Magyar”
(Hungarian) name from the aspects of linguistics and
ethnology as well. The name “Magyar” as a nation
appears in the Arabian sources around 870-880 in the
form of mžghr; read as: mod’žgher (Moravcsik 1927:
259).
Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur, a historian writing in
Chagatai from Hiva, in his work Šejere-i Türk written
around 1660 records the two sons of the Uighur
emperor, Tartar and Mungl who are the founders and
ancient figures of the Tartar and the Mongol peoples
(Solymossy 1992: 191)8. In the origin myths of the
Voguls (Mansi) the nations Por and Mos (“the
walker”, and “the winged”) are from the two
“paskers”, however, there are two of them, against all
other examples, they are not brothers and they do not
pursue the stag together. The last characteristic
resembles to the Karachay-Balkar myth, where
Biynöger chases the white doe, to bring its milk for
his ill brother, Umar as medicine (Tavkul 2004:
99-103). In a Bulgarian carol (koleda in Bulgarian)
two brothers find two stags with golden antlers which
bear a sun on the forehead, a moon on their breasts
and stars on their antlers. “It is intriguing, that we find
two hunting brothers in a Bulgarian material” (Berze
Nagy 1927: 147). Since the Bulgarians and the
Hungarians have a common Turkic culture (West Old
Turkic)9 on the (western) steppes, the recent data
discovered from the Bulgarian folklore, are probably a
phenomena of survival and totally identical with the
Hungarian brothers chasing the deer.
Tekla Dömötör, Hungarian folklorist, drew our
attention to the fact that in the European set of myths,
the pursuing pair of brothers is a uniquely Hungarian
feature. This statement is proved to be authentic by a
tale recorded on Polish soil. Dömötör summed up the
Polish legend in this matter:
He spends his days at the uncle of Prince St. Imre, at the Polish King Bołeslav I Chrobry. One day they go on a hunt and start to pursue a stag, they reach the top of the (Bald) hill of Łysa Gora. The stag disappears, but Imre recognizes that he saw the place in his dreams last night. He asks his uncle, Bołeslav, to build a monastery at the location. (Dömötör 1958: 321)
They collected several other versions of the St.
Imre (St. Emeric) myth from the Árpád dynasty, and
in all of them: “the pursuing pair of brothers is of high
birth” which is a returning feature not from Christian
sources, but markedly Central Eurasian heritage
(Dömötör 1958: 321).
In the Ossetian Nart epic, Ahsartag and his twin
brother Ahsar are guarding the garden of a golden
apple tree, which is surrounded by a fence made of
deer antlers. At dawn, the beautiful Dzerassa flies into
the garden in the form of a dove to pick golden apples.



ͻͶ͸ Sociology Study 2(12)
Ahsartag tries to shoot her with an arrow, but can only
wound her and later he finds her again in an
underwater palace and marries her (Kovács 2008: 4-6).
In another version of the Nart heroic poem, a friend of
hero named Soslan10 is pursuing a stag with golden
hide, but he returns from the hunt with empty hands,
because his weapons are ineffective against the stag11.
After this, Soslan will also try to hunt down the
golden stag, and the same thing happens. Later in the
afterlife, the golden stag will lead him into a sky
palace, where it will transform into the daughter of the
Sun God12. They are united by love, get married and
from this marriage, the ancients of the Ossetians are
born (Kovács 2008: 103-117). The features that there
are two of them, but not bound by blood, and that they
are founding a new homeland resemble to the Vogul
(Mansi) and Ostyak (Khanty) myths (Berze Nagy
1927: 73)13. But the plot, as can be observed, shows
grand differences, furthermore in the Vogul and
Ostyak variations it is not marked whether the deer is
male or female, and also killing the animal is not the
purpose of the heroes of the Ossetian and Hungarian
legends.
In the Hindu mythology, the feature of the
brothers may also be found. In the folkloric tale-like
Ramayana (400 BC-200 AD), which consists of 36
thousand lines, the feature can also be found.
In the upcoming, the main features are to be
highlighted that might bear some interest: a king
(Dsaratha) exiled his son named Rama who was the
heir to the throne to keep his word he promised to the
mother of his son, named Bharata. One of Rama’s
siblings, Lakshmana does not accept the loss of the
brother, so he/she accompanies him. There are four of
the siblings, but only two of them have actual roles.
They reach a forest where among the numerous
happenings, the deer hunt and the marriage of Rama
also take place.
Besides the Hungarian origin myth, the main work
of Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur Khan, the Šejere-i Türk, also
bears the features that provide an example for the case
when the nation inherits the name of the founder of
the nation (Ögel 2002: 27). In a few tales from
Kamchatka, a woman gives birth to two twin children
whose father is a male wolf. These two children are
the founders of the people who live there. This myth
supposedly is quite well spread in that area (Ögel
2002: 44).
Radloff (1866) wrote about two siblings of a Shor
(a people that belongs to the eastern branch of the
Turkic people, a South-Siberian ethnic-group) heroic
epic where the boy named Kan-Pergen has a sister
named Kan-Argo. In the long story, the deer hunt will
only appear later, but the sister will not have a role in
the scene (Ögel 2002: 582-583). Two opposing
hunters take part in the hunt, Kan-Alıp and the above
mentioned Kan-Pergen (Radloff 1866: 313-314).
Sándor Solymossy refers to Diodorus Siculus and
Plinius when discussing that the ancients of the
Scythians are similarly two brothers: the two sons of
Skythés emperor, Palos and Napes from whom the
two nations Pal and Nap are derived from (Solymossy
1992: 191).
Updated by several Buddhist influences, still in
this form the Gesar myth bears the marks of the
nomad steppes where Gesar khan and his bodyguard
Adju Mergen will take part in the deer hunt: “Gesar
khan and Adju Mergen were pursuing it together and
almost caught up, when suddenly the gates of the
fortress were slammed shut before them” (Kara 1971:
68). According to the surviving stories in the
collection of One Thousand and One Days:
“[Rusvanshad] Sends away his escort and he sleeps
beside the well with his captains” (Kerényi 1930: 147).
Here the companion does not have a role, his presence
is only explained by deep tradition.
As the above shown examples depict it clearly, the
sub-feature of the two brothers appears at other Asian
peoples as well (India: four siblings, Mongolian,
Vogul, Evenki), but mostly they can be found among
the folkloric culture of the Turkic ethnic groups, as
István Pál Demény showed this earlier (Demény 2002:



Mátéffy ͻͶ͹
39). This is the remainder of the dualic world view,
but also it refers to the importance of reproducing the
nation (Demény 2002: 37)14. The leader of the
European Huns, Attila has his co-leader Bleda,
meanwhile his predecessor Ruas had Oktar. At the
Turkish neighbours of the Asian Huns, the O-sun
(Wu-sun) people, the big Kun-bi and the small Kun-bi
reign (Alföldi 1933: 28). The peer leaders are also
present in the ancient Turkish inscriptions, Bumin and
Istämi khagans are also ruling at the same period. The
Hungarians also inherit this ruling regime, as we can
read it from Ibn Rustah (through Abu al-Jaihani):
The Magyar is a branch of the Turks. Their chief rides out with twenty thousand horsemen. The name of their chief is K.nd.h (kündä/kändä; Ligeti 1986: 254, 484). This however is only a titular name for their king, since the man who is ruling them as their king is called Ğ.l.h (ġila/Gyula; Ligeti 1986: 253-254)... (Kristó 1995: 32-33)
The origin of this regime is explained by András
Alföldi:15
According to the Ugor16 and the Samoyed17 examples, this articulation of the nomadic state form evolved from what is called “vaterrechtliches Zweiklassensystem” by the ethnologists. This social arrangement and the attached exogamy can indeed be found in the world of the steppes, and it also provides the basis for the colossal nomadic state forms, appearing worldwide, just as for the social life of the tiny fractured ethnic groups wandering by themselves. This is nicely reflected in the life of the mounted pastoral origin traditions. (Alföldi 1933: 32)
The founding of the church at Vác, according to
the Chronicon Pictum, happened at the urge of two
princes from the Árpád dynasty, Géza and his younger
brother Saint Ladislaus—later King Géza I of
Hungary (1074-1077) and King Ladislaus I of
Hungary (St. László) (1077-1095)—who did see the
apparition of the stag representing Christ, the angel of
God, and just as in Polish myths it showed the
location for Saint Emeric and Bołeslav where to erect
the Saint Cross Monastery, here it shows the place for
the princes where to build the Boldogasszony
Cathedral (could be translated into Cathedral of the
Blessed Woman) (Berze Nagy 1927: 74).
In the three versions of the Hungarian tales, just as
in the tale from India, only two siblings have
meaningful role from all of them. In the examples, it
can be found that in the Köktürk and in the Ramayana,
there are also more than two siblings, but similarly
only two of them take part in the evolution of the plot.
Also in the case of Simon of Kéza, the two firstborn
sons of Nemroth are Hunor and Magor. It can be read
in the first Hungarian version of the Tārih-i Ungurūs:
“Nemroth had a wife called Ankisa, who gifted him
with two sons. One was called Magor, the other Hunor.
They were the first sons of Nemroth, ...” (Mahmūd
1988: 24).
In the Balkar data (Habichlani 1984), quoted by
Tavkul (2004: 99-129), Bijnöger and Umar are also
brothers: Bijnöger and Umar go on a hunt. Umar falls
from his horse and becomes ill. Bijnöger goes to the
mountan giants, the Emegens, to ask for an advice to
cure his brother. According to the counsel, Bijnöger
can only cure Umar, if he finds Maral, the wondrous
white doe in the forest. He must bring her milk and
make Umar drink it to cure him.
The Feature of “Founding a New Homeland”
In the Byzantian and Western cultures, the feature of
“founding a new homeland” is substituted by founding
a monastery, just as in the Byzantian tale where: “In
the impenetrable forest Nikephoros emperor is
pursuing a buck whom he brings down at the location
of the altar of the later built monastery” (Moravcsik
1926: 146)18. And in the legend of Saint Meinulf,
“The remarkably huge stag, identical with Christ,
signifies the place of the main altar of the temple to be
built...” (Moravcsik 1926: 146; Pschmadt 1911: 51).
In the legend of the establishment of the church at Vác
(Chronica Pictum; the history of St. Ladislaus and
Géza), this appears relevance may be found:
And when they were standing near Vác, where the



ͻͶ ͅ Sociology Study 2(12)
church of Apostle St. Peter stands now, a stag appeared to them—his antlers were full of burning candles—and they were watching he started to run towards the forest, and stopped at the very place, where the monastery is standing now. When the solders wanted to shoot him with arrows, he threw himself into the Danube, and they did not see him again... Thus King Géza founded the church of Vác bestowing it an abundance of riches and lands. (Mark of Kalt’s 2004: 82)
Therefore the doe showing the way for the two
royal people (Thompson 1966: 374, 377) at the
founding of the church of Vác is a heritage the
Magyars brought with themselves from the east to the
west, during seeking their new homeland, mixed with
the Christian features of church establishment19. The
unique mixture of the eastern and western mythic
tradition in the case of the first version of the Tārih-i
Ungurūs is present where probably the founding of the
new homeland is being replaced by the later known
monastery building in the origin myth, through oral
folklore. In the first version the event is being
described as follows:
No matter how long the two princes [Hunor and Magor] tried to find the animal, they did not manage to find him. They did not know its name, or species. The two princes got tired in a short while being draught in the sea of sadness sorrow. Later they discussed what to do next. Then they returned to their father, pleading him to build a sanctuary for them in the mountainous lands at the border of Adjem [the Sassanid Persia] to live there in exile from the people of the world where they can mind their own concerns. (Mahmūd 1988: 24)
Taking the above mentioned data into
consideration, the author would not exclude the idea
that the mythical features of the “establishment of
monasteries” widespread in Europe (Moravcsik 1926:
145; Berze Nagy 1927: 73-74)20 and known in
Byzantine (Moravcsik 1926: 146)21 have Caucasian
roots. This is also supported by the fact that the
Tārih-i Ungurūs mentions the border of Ajdem (Persia)
and a mountainous landscape. Furthermore, the
literature Derbend-nâmeh22 mentions Hungarian
towns established by Khosrau I Anushirwan
(531-579), the emperor of the Sassanid Persian
Empire. The names of these two towns are Kitchi
Madjar and Oulou Madjar23 (Kazem-Beg 1851). The
Russian chronicles refer to this North-Caucasian area
Madšaragadzor in the thirteenth century, meanwhile
the Caucasian mountains are named as the “Magyar
mountains”. Antal Hodinka (1916: 26-27, 29, 33, 68,
349) announces such quotations from four different
Russian chronicles (1100-1282) (Bendefy 1942:
28-29).
This data will probably be sufficient to consider
the common presence of the Hungarians and the
Christians in the sixth and seventh century. Supported
by the above mentioned data, the author considers it
highly possible that the feature of “establishing a
monastery” substituted the “founding of a new
homeland” in the oral legends of the Caucasian
Hungarians or at least its features had been inserted
into the existing myth. The author also thinks, that it is
highly probable, that the Byzantian Eustachius legend
(Bendefy 1942: 28-29) somehow contacted the origin
myth of the Huns, or at least served as an inspiration
to it which is also supported by the fact that
Sozomenos (cca. 400-450 AD) Christian historian
knew about several versions of doe-myths (Moravcsik
1914: 283-284; Berze Nagy 1927: 69). The syncretic
(both pagan and Christian) origin myth (Tārih-i
Ungurūs, the first legend) of the Hungarians which
they brought from the Caucasian mountains to Middle
Europe, their new homeland, only revived the
tradition of the previously (by the age of the Conquest
which is the end of the ninth century) widespread
legends about deer chasing and establishing
monasteries of Byzantine origin.
The Role of the Hungarian Árpád Dynasty in Acclimatizing the Doe Myths in Europe
The plot of the story about the doe is unexpectedly
visualized by a Catalan collection of folk songs as
well. The folk songs were collected by Manuel Milà i



Mátéffy ͻͶͻ
Fontanals (1818-1884) in the Baixa Cerdanya (in
Spanish: Baja Cerdaña) tour near Andorra, before
1882 (Milá y Fontanals 1882). In these versions of
folk songs, Hungary (Hongria) and the miracle stag
appear together24. Therefore the miracle stag is present
in the Catalan folk songs, while in the songs that were
collected outside of the Spanish Catalonia (Castilia,
Galicia, etc.) the deer is substituted by a girl enhanced
by magic (Milá y Fontanals 1882: 174; Bohigues 1983:
92). The framework of the contacts among the folk
songs spread through the Iberian Peninsula deserves a
complex chronological research, but at the moment it
only may be stated that it cannot be a coincidence that
the icon of the stag appeared in the Catalan folk songs
instead of the appearing in the Spanish ones. The
reassuring proof for the seriousness of the
Hungarian-Catalan complex link (even if they are
remarkably far from each other geographically) can be
derived from historical data. Violant of Hungary
(Jolánta), from the Árpád dynasty (1219-1251), the
daughter of King András II of Hungary (reigned
1205-1235), to fulfill diplomatic and political
purposes, married James I of Aragon (the Conqueror)
(reigned 1213-1276) at the age of 1625. Around this
period (1164-1410) in Aragon, House Barcelona was
in power.
The husband of Violant was one of Europe’s most significant rulers of the time; with this marriage, the Árpád dynasty inscribed its name among the highest of the European ruling houses. From the ten children of Jacme and Violant, five sat on the throne, as Tourtoulon says, it would not be hard to show that many European royal families [or their presumptive succsessors] are the decendants of Jacme the Conqueror. By this Violant became the ancestress of the European royal families. (Brachfeld 1930: 15-16)
Violant spent just as many years as the Queen of
Aragon, from the Árpád dynasty in Barcelona, the
capital of the court of Aragon (Soltész 2005: 161), as
she spent in the court of Andrew II of Hungary, in
Esztergom (Estrigonia) from her birth till her marriage.
Despite her short life, she did have a remarkably high
reputation among the people of Catalonia which did
not deteriorate even after her death26. Due to this
reason different works survived in the oral tradition of
the people of Catalonia27.
For the medieval kings, choosing a match was not determined by love; it is only augmented by the positive folkloric tales. The marriage of the royal people merges from social relation to a political one; and on the level of consciousness it becomes the bearer of cultural relations... The protective household gards, kind friends, an army of servant girls, chefs and hunters, “tárnoks” (a typical Hungarian trade of this period, mostly involves the tasks of a servant) and smelters, stable-boys and kennel masters (in Hungary, they specialized in the training of Greyhounds) follow the Queen to her new home knowing they will never return. And as they go, they carry a few belongings from their everyday lives, they bring symbolic belongings representing ethical code systems and as a consequence, they also bring their culture from home. (Vajay 1984: 395)
The Hungarian origin legend also reached
Catalonia through the escort of the Princess28, thus the
Catalonian folk songs interpreting the narratives about
the miracle stag are bound to the Árpád dynasty, just
as the Polish legends connected to Prince Saint Imre
(Saint Emeric of Hungary). This is one Catalonian
folk song version about the miracle stag:
Aquí dalt a la muntanya, n’hi havia una font viva. Viva l’amor! Viva l’amor, que l’amor viva! Viva l’amor! Hi havia un cérvol qui hi bevia. Un caçador l’hi espia. Caçador, mira, no em tiris: no en só cérvol, que en só nina. Só filla del rei d’Hongria.29 Ai, nina, si jo ho sabia amb tu, bé, m’hi casaria. No em dieu pas si us voldria? Minyona, jo ho provaria.30 (English translation from Catalonian by Nóra Lengyel in 2012: A top of the mountain, right here, a vital fount was found. Cheers to love, cheers to love.



ͻͷͲ Sociology Study 2(12)
Cheers to love, the love that cheers. There was a drinking deer and a huntsman who was observing it. Watch out, huntsman: don’t shoot at me, please. I’m not a deer but I’m a maiden. I’m the daughter of Hungary’s king. Oh, maiden. If I had known it, I would have just married you. Don’t you ask me if I want it, too? Darling, I would like to ask you.)
Brachfeld (1930: 48) wrote about the appearance
of the name “Hungria” in folk songs as follows: “The
knowledge about foreign countries, often even the
mere name of them, is generally excluded from the
wisdom of the uneducated commons; ... this makes
the phenomenon even more ostentatious, since the
knowledge of the Catalan people suddenly widens at
such a point as the concept of ‘Hungary’”. This author
enlisted 28 Catalonian folk songs where the “Hungria”
word appears, and also determined that “the word
Hungria came into the folk poetry from a higher social
layer” (Brachfeld 1930: 49). Since the escort of a
queen means a higher social class (and a narrower one)
than the folk song praising and tradition spreading
(Catalonian) lower class, tha argument must be taken
to heart. Brachfeld (1930: 49-50) made up six groups
of the folk songs that have Hungarian relations in
them. The “Enchanted Girl (La nina encantada, El
caçador i la cervola, El caçador i la serpent)” is the
third group31, from which the author quoted the above
mentioned folk song. Brachfeld (1930: 52) also let us
know that the Catalonian folk songs have their own
equivalent in Latin (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and
French) folk tradition. He wrote about the previously
mentioned folk song: “... we cannot even call the
short little folksong titled Enchanted Girl (La nina
encantada) a ballad” (Brachfeld 1930: 67). He also
showed us a variation:
La niña encantada. Aqui dalt a la montinya N’hi havia una font viva. Viva l’amor! Viva l’amor, que l’amor viva!
Viva l’amor! Hi havia un cervo qui hi bevia. Un caçador li espia. Caçador, mira, no’m tiris: no’n só cervo, que’n só nina. Só filla del rei d’Hungaria Ai nina, si jo u sabia, amb tu bé m’hi casaria. No’m dieu pas si u volria? Minyona, jo ho provaria. (Brachfeld 1930: 67) (English translation by Nóra Lengyel in 2012: The huntsman and the hind / deer Under the rock, down here where a vital fount can be found, cheers to love, the love that cheers. There’s a vital fount, a deer was drinking here; and a huntsman was observing it. Watch out, huntsman, don’t shoot at me; you doesn’t hit me anyway. I’ll tell you who’s my father: I’m the daughter of Hungary’s king! If my father knew it, he’ll dress me in gold and silver, silver in everyday, in gold at a special day, and I’ll eat at his table. At his table I’ll eat and a welcommed guest I’ll be. Cheers to love, the love that cheers.)
Another version of the folk songs from the book of
Brachfeld collected by Milà y Fontanals will be
quoted:
La niña encantada. Aqui dalt de la montana (Viva l’amor qu’es l’amor mia, Viva l’amor!) Una cervola hi bevia, Un cassadó se la mira: “Cassadó mira y no’m tiris Que’t diré de qui so filla: So filla del rey d’Ungria, Neboda del de Castilla.” Cérvola si yo ho sabía Am vosté m’en casaría. (Brachfeld 1930: 68)
The folk songs have other unpublished versions



Mátéffy ͻͷͳ
(1930) among the records of Fundaçió de la Obra del
Cançoner Català (Brachfeld 1930: 68). Brachfeld was
the first who published one of these.
El caçador i la cervola. Aqui baix amb una arquia Si n’hi ha una font viva Viva l’amor, Quq l’amor viva! Si n’hi ha una font viva I una cierva que hi bevia; I un caçador li espia. Mira, caçador, no em tiris, que tampoc no em tocaries,32 Que te diré de nun som filla: Som filla del rei Lungria (!)33 Que si el pare ho sabia, D’or i plata me vestiria, La plata per cada dia, I el or per una desmasia, A la seua taula dinaria A la seua taula dinaria I seria ben recibida. Viva l’amor, Que l’amor viva! (Recorded in Tordera, Catalonia Spain.) (Brachfeld 1930: 68-69)
This author published three more versions from
Toreda: one from Molló, one from Escaldes (Andorra),
and one from Sant Aniol I Baget, where he offered his
love for the life of the stag (Brachfeld 1930: 69). And
one more variant is from Campdevànol (Brachfeld
1930: 72). Brachfeld (1930: 92) summed up his
thoughts about the partly unpublished Hungarian
interrelated ballads on Catalonian soil: “Also the
Hungarian figures and references of the Catalonian
literature are in connection with those Hungarian
people who wandered to the distant lands of Catalonia
during the centuries”. It is clearly visible that the
Hungarian Árpád dynasty and their close milieu did
not only naturalize myths about the Miracle Stag in
Polish lands, but also in the Catalonian ones.
The representatives of the ethnographic discipline
describe this through the concepts of folklorization
and deteriorative singing34 (Zersingung). The term
“descending cultural goods” from German origins
(Gesunkenes Kulturgut) as such is not representative,
or at least too much unilateral and for this it has been
excluded from the word bank of the ethnographic and
cultural anthropology. It may be rightfully proposed
that the myth of the Miracle Stag was widely spread
among the folk of Hungary and similarly among the
escort of Violant of Hungary. However it supposedly
did not exist in Hungarian chronicles at the time.
Anonymus, who did not record the origin myth of
Hungarians in an explicit manner, had his work
completed around 1200 “and most probably the
Ancient Hungarian Chronicle (that was created around
1100 in the age of King Kálmán, although in some of
its chapters, till the middle of the eleventh century,
even dating back till the 30s and 40s)” (Veszprémy
2005: 99) supposedly had a few copies still intact. The
aggressive expansion of the Western Christianity
proves that here, by details not to be expressed, that
the Hungarian chronicles retreated from recording of
pagan myth of origin. This makes it apparent that the
Hungarian legend about the Miracle Hind might only
have reached Catalonia through the oral tradition of
Queen Violant’s escort.
The significance of these legends is also shown in
the evolutionary process during which the text of the
Central Eurasian myth (through switching genre once
or more times) is rationalized, expressing alternatively,
its viewpoint closing to the natural sciences. Róheim
(1917: 85) without any knowledge about the Catalan
folksongs also highlighted this process, and without
any regard to him, Alföldi (1933) and Kerényi (1930:
145, 147-148) also pointed out the aforementioned
factors through the tale of The Thousand and One
Days (Pétis de La Croix and McCarthy 1892) (Central
Eurasian Turkic origin—Persian description). Kerényi
(1930: 148) wrote as follows:
The progress of the [tale...] of The Thousand and One Days is also very instructive, since the grade of transition—the shapeshifting between the mythical animal and the human realism—between the eastern and western



ͻͷʹ Sociology Study 2(12)
doe-girl tale is represendted in an administrative form... Who reads the Hungarian or Hun deer myth in an alternative history, he will not be able to derive the type of the tale Thousand and One Days, neither able to determine its benefactor to the totemic myth in the background. It’s a different situation when these three types stand before us with a historical link.
The feature of a girl changing into a doe is
apparent in the Turkic-Persian stories, in the
Caucasian (Ossetian and Karachay-Balkar) myths,
inserted into the Mongol Gesar legend35 and from the
point of content it is present in the Catalonian lyric
folkloric works with Hungarian roots. Originally the
marriage of the hero and the mythical doe is the
central feature of most examples. These characteristics
can also be found in the stories of Bamsi Beyrek in the
Oghuz Turk epic Book of Dede Korkut, from the book
of Muhammediye and also in the Hungarian legends
where the deer no longer stands for the totemic
ancient mother, but as a remainder it still shows the
place where the hero finds his love, the ancient mother
of the nation that will spring from him. Consequently
the aforementioned myths contain the grades of
rational evolution in them. If Róheim knew about the
Turkic-Persian myths published by Kerényi and the
Hungarian-Catalan versions published by Brachfeld,
probably he would have given more effort for
explicating the totemic mother-doe existence.
As the interaction between the Byzantian and
Eurasian legends returns, it may seem impossible that
the legend of Eustachius reached the Caucasian
Mountains and the Huns (Onogurs, Sabirs [sabartoi
asphaloi], Bulgarians, Utigur and Kutrigur Huns)
living at the foothills of the Caucasus during the
Byzantian and Armenian proselytizations in the fourth
century, and this enabled that it only existed under the
name “Magyar” from the sixth century (after 530), but
living at the foothills of the Caucasus even earlier
under the name “Kutrigur” (Dindorf 1831: 430-433;
Moravcsik 1927: 271) resulting that some mixed
(eastern pagan and Byzantian Christian) versions of
the legend about deer chasing could manifest among
the Pre-Magyars of this period (before 530) affected
by the Christian conversion36. One version was
preserved by the first Hunor-Magor legend of the
Tārih-i Ungurūs. The autochton Hun-Bulgarian
Hungarian tradition of the Miracle Stag united with
the legend of the Byzantian Saint Eustachius quite
early meaning that this might have had an earlier
version before the Hungarian Conquest (895 AD)
(Kardos 1958: 323)
Other European examples are to be enlisted:
Charles IV (Karol IV; the hot springs of Karlsbad),
Ansegius, Saint Gellért (Gerardo Sagredo, the Abbey
of Bakony, Hungary), Saint Ladislaus (Vác,
Nagyvárad, Hungary), Barsvár, etc. (Pschmadt 1911:
58, 68, 70, 134 ; Berze Nagy 1927: 74). This is the
so-called legend of church establishment; however in
a direct and somewhat indirect way it evolved from
the Central Eurasian type of “founding a new
homeland”.
Despite the fact that in 1914, Moravcsik (1914:
18-19) thought that the myth about the doe was not
brought by the Huns, but Berze Nagy (1927: 70) and
Demény (2002: 40) both disproved him with rational
reasons, Kerényi (1930: 145) also criticized
Moravcsik’s system of filology. Berze Nagy (1927: 76)
assumed that the difference between the two group of
legends was that the Christian legends, where the
buck/stag is replaced by the doe/hind, did not contain
the acquaintance of land or wife.
Recently Baldick assessed through Roux (1984)
that the feature of the deer leading the nation into a
new homeland was apparent in the culture of Inner
Asia (Baldick 2000: 24) and in the culture of the Huns
as well (Baldick 2000: 6, 28). This does not tell
anything new to the people who know the works of
Jordanes, Prokopios and Sozomenos. It is more
important that the characteristic of the “leading” deer
is often found in Central and Inner Asia. Most of these
were written down by Bahaeddin Ögel in his work
Türk Mitolojisi (Turkic Mythology) three decades
earlier than Baldick. This motif is also apparent in



Mátéffy ͻͷ͵
most of the Turkic epics from the Book of Dede
Korkut (Gökyay 2006: 62-63, 1165), through the myth
of the Shors and from the Altay Turks to the Legend
of Oguz Khan (Oguznâme)37.
Marriage
According to Berze Nagy, there is only one hero in the
structure of the ancient myths. He is led to the other
riverside by the deer (the supernatural being), he will
receive fertile lands from the deer who changes into a
noble lady, later becoming the wife of the hero (Berze
Nagy 1927: 162). Two Ossetian versions also support
his notion in the Catalonian folk songs, in which the
hero escorts Dzerassa38, the daughter of the Sea God,
appearing in her deer form, into the undersea palace.
Later he will marry the lady. The hero Sosruko goes to
a palace in the sky, instead of an undersea palace,
where the doe changes into the daughter of the Sun
God, whom he marries later. A long and a different
version of the myth can be found in the Nart epics.
The hero named Soslan, as a fallow deer, is chasing
Atsiruhs, the daughter of the Sun God into a mountain
cave, and finally marries her. The location of the first
section of the second story is not in the mountains but
on the lakeside. Here the deer is the daughter of a
person named Balsag. Ögel mentions that in the tales
of the Altay peoples, the heroes during the deer-chase
reach the foot of a mountain made of copper and/or
iron where the deer changes to light and then
disappears; they end up in a mountain cave where as a
price of the compelling heroes the wild animals
shapeshift into beautiful girls (refer to: Hungarian
legends), whom they will marry (refer to: the
Hungarian legends), and this marriage will give birth
to the new tribes (refer to: Hungarian legends).
The narrative remaining from the collection The
Thousand and One Days tells about the marriage of
the pursued hind shaped girl besides other
corresponding features (summary):
The young king of China, Rusvanshad39 finds a white
doe during his hunting. This one has blue and black spots, golden bracelets on its legs and a decorated saddle-cover on its back. The king is chasing it, until he losts her trail. Just when he gives up pursuing her, he finds it again resting near a well. As he races towards it, the deer jumps into the well and disappears in it. Rusvanshad figures that this could also be the girl who maddens the huntsmen. He sends away his escort and spends the night at the well with his fellow captains. And once they wake up to the sound of a beautiful music. They see a wonderful palace in front of them. They intrude and inside the throne room they see the beautiful girl who has abandoned her deer-form and amuses herself in the company of her 50-60 ladies. The girl is the daughter of the ghost king of Shahristan Island. The only reason she changed into the form of a deer, is to charm Rusvanshad. They fall in love. The death of the ghost king disturbs them for a time, the palace disappears by morning, but later they fill find each other again, get married and have a boy and a girl. (Kerényi 1930: 146-147)
In another part of the story the tribe name Naiman
might appear which combined with the name of
Rusvanshad confirms the Central Asian Turkic origin
of the story (Kerényi 1930: 147). This is also
supported by the fact that the hero and his captain are
left together where the deer disappeared (Kerényi
1930: 151). This is the feature that is considered
typically Turkic, and preserved by most Hungarian
versions as well; and as Tekla Dömötör highlighted it
previously, in Europe, it is considered a typically
Hungarian characteristic. And the number of the 50-60
court ladies of the heroine shows its connection to the
Hungarian legends40. Much rather the relation with
Chronicon Pictum, than with what Simon of Kéza
wrote41. “... They accidentally found the wives and
the children of the sons of Bereka in a deserted place
where they were celebrating the event of the horn, as
they danced to music in their tents without their
husbands” (Mark of Kalt’s 2004: 11). The similar
feature can be found in the Ossetian Nart epic about
deer chasing legends, however there it is not directly
part of the episode of marriage, but it is within that
wide category. Soslan42, to repay the demanded debt
(by the Uaigs43) for the marrying the daughter of the
Sun God, who earlier showed as a deer, goes to the



ͻͷͶ Sociology Study 2(12)
World of the Dead. There a series of adventures await
him, exactly like:
And again he finds himself on a great plain. A thick carpet of mushrooms swing on the ground. But never did Soslan see so many kinds of mushrooms sprout in one place. And also here, flocks are grazing on the thick grass, meanwhile predators are running past them. But they don’t bother the cattle and neither does it fear them.
It is visible that this great plain, as a wondrous
place, resembles formidably to the place called
Maeotis in the Hungarian legends: “And the land of
Maeotis is next to Persis; apart from a ford on one side,
it is surrounded by sea on all other sides; it doesn’t
have any rivers, but has plenty of grass, trees, birds,
fish and wild animals” (Simon of Kéza 2004: 91). In
the Ossetian version, a river substitutes the ford, and
the thick flocks are similarly apparent in these myths
as in the Hungarian ones. In the festivity of the horn
here is replaced by the celebration called simd. The
only difference here is that the protagonist will not
marry one of the dancing girls, in other words his
future bride is not among the members of dancing
party. The Central Asian Turkic origin tale (originally
a legend) is totally similar with the Hungarian myth
even in this respect, indeed; the plot also starts with
the determination of ethnicity. Maybe not to such an
enhanced extent as in the Hungarian myth of origin.
The oldest printed version of the Tibetan origin
Gesar-legend cycle dates back to 1716 (Kara 1971:
63). There is a scene of deer chase in the sixth section
of this Mongolic remembrance just as in the Ossetian
version, it changes back into the form of a woman,
whom has to marry the hero.
One morning, as they started off to hunt, Adju Mergen said this: Beyond this chasm and abyss filled pass, you shall meet a “red deer” with a white mark on its head. Catch up with it and never lose its white mark from your sight! And as foretold, the deer did leap before him. Gesar pursued it, gone ahead of it and shot the white mark on the red deer’s head. The iron head of the arrow came out at the back-end of the red deer. The deer tried to escape with the arrow in its body
toward the fortress of its monstrous sister. Gesar khan and Adju Mergen were pursuing it together and almost caught up, when suddenly the gates of the fortress were slammed shut before them. Then Gesar grabbed his steel cleaver “weighing ninety-three pounds” and struck at the gate, broke it and went in. When he went in, he changed into a beautifully handsome young man. Inside sat the bride collapsed, the sister of the Monster: at the peak of her head the end of the arrow stood out, and from her bottom, the point of the arrow. Would it be the arrow of the Devil? The arrow of the Dragon? Arrow of the Gods? Might it be the arrow of Gesar? How should I get to know this? —she asked from the young man. I would gladly pull the arrow from your body, damsel—said the boy. —If I pull it out, will you be my wife? Yes, I will be your wife... (Kara 1971: 67-68)
The location is similarly mountainous as in the
Tārih-i Ungurūs and the Karachay-Balkar legends.
The marriage and the founding of a new nation
also present in the legends of the Kyrgyz people (Ögel
2002), and also in the Muhammediye, in Anatolia
where the protagonist, Muhammed marries Hanefi
Mine-Hatun. This chapter involves the respected
ancient mother as the female specimen of a deer or
any other animal, the totemic beliefs which
obligatorily contain the feature of marriage or
founding a new homeland which was first connected
with the deer chasing by Róheim (1917: 85), as with
the genetic predecessor of its equivalent on the archaic
social level. The author also happens to agree with the
chronology and feature-genealogy of Róheim. The
coming back to the animal ancestor can be found in
the mythology of the Turkic peoples, mostly deer
(doe), (female) wolf or a kind of bird of prey is the
totem animal. The Göktürks have three distinctive
myths of origin (Sinor 1982: 223; Harmatta 1999:
385-397)44. The best known totemic myth of origin is
very likely to the legend of the Miracle Stag which
tells that an enemy exterminated the Turkic people
with the exception of a 10-year-old boy who was
thrown in the marsh, maimed. Later however a female
wolf found the boy and fed him with meat, and later,



Mátéffy ͻͷͷ
gave him 10 sons. One of them was A-shih-na, the
ancient of the ruling Turkic ethnic group (Harmatta
1999: 385). The wolf, just as the doe in the Hungarian
myth of origin, is the representative of the ancient
mother. According to the implications of János
Harmatta, this unfamiliar maternal-linear lineage is
the trail that can be traced back to the northern and
eastern Iranian tribes, to the Sakas and the Sauromatas
(Harmatta 1999: 389-90). The predecessor of the Hun
and Hungarian origin myth must be searched among
these Inner Asian Iranian tribes.
The Adaptation of Totemic Myths of Origin From Central Asia in the Christian Culture
In Hungarian oral tradition, the Miracle Stag legend’s
core content still lives after thousands of years as a
ritual text. The universal features in the collected
regöséneks (Sebestyén 1902: 71; 2001: 156)
(Hungarian ritual songs of fertility) counting more
than a hundred: a fertilizing part, wish the man and the
people of the house fertility and wealth, and there is a
coupling part where the young man and the young girl
are being sang together by the participants (motif of
marriage: 4). In the introductory part, the regös (The
singer of the regösének) says how far a journey they
had, they are the emissaries of God or the servants of
Saint Stephen I of Hungary (from the Árpád dynasty).
The epic introduction contains the part about the
Miracle Stag as well. A clear river is created, a green
lawn or bulrush grows on it, and the Miracle Buck is
grazing on it. On its antlers candles are being lit and
put out by themselves and he wears the sun and the
moon on its body. They sometimes ask Saint Stephen
I of Hungary, not to shoot at them (Ortutay 1977-1982:
330-332). As visible, there is much in common with
the subject of the Catalonian folk songs. In the ethnic
group of the Hungarian Csángós (in Moldavia and in
Hungary), the same Central Eurasian content can be
found in the marriage related texts; the bridegroom
and his friends greet the house of the bride with the
news of wounding a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
(in the second half of the twentieth century, the
original cultic animal [hind, doe; in Latin: Cerva] is
replaced by the roe deer and later, due to the
deterioration of the oral text, a limping rabbit
substitutes the roe deer—own collected material,
gathered by the author in: Lábnyik [Vladnic],
Moldavia area of Romania. Informants: Klára Bot
[born 1940] and Györgyné Laczkó Tyila, Teréz [born
1943], July 20 and July 24, 2012). During hunting, its
footprints led the party to this house, and they demand
the animal. Finally, of course, the “hunter” and the
doe (hind) are married.
... Where and why did you come from? —asked the relatives of the girl. This is when the nyírásza (bride) is hidden and only nyírel (bridegroom) knows where she is, according to what they discussed previously. The friends of the bridegroom begin the long tale. Where and why we came from, I shall tell you shortly, so that you all may know. We on this day went on a hunt, and a beautiful roe leaped before us. This young friend of ours shot at it, and it bled, nevertheless it escaped (Is it not the myth of the Miracle Stag that remained in this form of courtship?—Original comment of Mihály Laczkó). And the trail of blood led us to this house. We thought that if honorable people live in this house, they will return the roe to us, because our young hunter craves his prey with a broken heart... The nyírel goes out and brings back the roe, the nyírásza... (I. Laczkó 1989: 43; M. Laczkó 2004: 291-292)
In the case of the Central Asia origin (Bíró et al.
2009: 305-310) Hungarians, this amply registered Cult
of Hind (ancient mother) was in evidence long before
their first contact with the Christianity at the Sea of
Azov (Lake Maeotis, city of Bosphorus) and in North
Caucasia. In the case of Central and Inner Asian
peoples, the Sun is a symbol of femininity which is
shown by the epic of the Ossetian Narts who are the
direct descendants of the Scythians and Alans, where
the daughter of the Sun God changes to a woman from
the doe form. At the Bulgarian descendants of the
Huns in the narrative called carol (koleda) collected in
the twentieth century, a buck with golden antlers

wearing the Sun on its forehead, the Moon on its
breast and stars on its antlers. In the Hungarian
regöséneks (or regös-songs; Hungarian ritual songs of
fertility), the “Miracle Stag” wears lighted candles on
its antlers, and wears the Sun and the Moon on its
body. The Bulgarians and the Hungarians brought
these ancient features from Central Asia through the
Caucasian Mountains, the Sea of Azov to the
universally Christian Europe. To a Europe that has the
ancient Greek heritage of the Sun as the symbol of
masculinity (Apollo) and the Moon as a feminine
symbol (Selene) inverting the Steppean (Hun,
Hungarian, Bulgarian and general Turkic) mythology.
In the Kingdom of Hungary, the western Christianity
became the universally accepted state religion at the
coronation ceremony of Stephen I of Hungary
(1000-1088; father of the protagonist of the Polish
deer chasing legends, Saint Emeric of Hungary). In
the Great Legend of Saint Stephen I (the twelfth
century) (Érszegi 1983: 34-53), it can be read that
without an heir, the king offers Hungary to the
protection of Mary, who is called upon as the “Queen
of the Sky” in his prayers (Érszegi 1983: 48-49). This
is where the “Regnum Marianum” (Country of Mary;
also the Catholic name of Hungary) term comes from.
The oldest known and surviving Hungarian
contiguous text is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer (in
Hungarian: Halotti Beszéd és Könyörgés) written
between 1192 and 1195 is located on the 136th page
of the the sacramentarium (collection of prayers)
Pray-codex which is written in Latin language. On the
Hungarian Prayer, you can find the section: “And we
bless the Saint Woman Mary” (“És imádjuk Szent
Asszony Máriát”). From this data it may be derived
that the Hungarians had their Cult of Mary even in the
Árpád era, on the dawn of Christianity (Tánczos 2010).
In the iconography of the “Woman dressed in the
Sun” (Mulier Amicta Sole) spread across Europe,
Mary is visualized arrayed among 12 stars, the Sun
and the Moon. This image is the symbolic illustration
of the Immaculate Conception and appears first in the
Speculum Humanae Salvationis (Mirror of Human
Salvation; between 1309 and 1324) (Szőllősy 1991:
18). Though from an iconographic aspect it can be
originated from “The Apocalypse of John (And a great
sign was seen in heaven: a woman arrayed with the
sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of 12 stars)”45, but the cult it represents can be
seen from the Hungarian data, that it is the parallel of
the Central Eurasian ancient Goddess, and exchanges
the Mother God of the origin myths (Szőllősy 1991:
19). Among the South Siberian and Central Eurasian
peoples the deer (and also the hunter) appears as a
celestial object (Berezkin 2005: 79, 83-86), and as the
Inner Asian “deer stones” from the Bronze Age is also
visualized as (beaked) deer figures swimming toward
the Sun-disk. This cult of Ancestress is the
predecessor of the Mary Cult before taking on the
Christianity. In two Evenki myths, one Hamnigan
legend, in the Mongolic origin myth and in one of the
Old Turkic origin myth from a Chinese source (860)
published by Sinor Denis (1982), the doe is the
symbol of the Sun and the Ancestress at the same time.
Its antler is the Tree of Life which is the symbol of
fertility for the ethnic group (Uray-Kőhalmi 2009:
19-20).
From the cosmology of the natives of Siberia and Inner Asia, there is a strong mental connection between the birds sitting on the branches, signifying the souls of the ones to be born, and the tree symbolizing the life force of the family with the Ancestress existing among the roots of the tree. The ancestress is mostly represented by the deer, as we have seen... The origin myths about the deer bearing the arrow in its body as the ancestress [refer to: immaculate conception] and the Tree of Life with birds and the female ungulate animals fertilized by birds of prey managed to sprout through the connection with the world views of the numerous peoples of the Eurasian taiga and steppes even today, just as the myths of the Hungarian conquerors. (Uray-Kőhalmi 2009: 23-24)
The second oldest Hungarian textual recording is
also connected to the symbol of the ancestress Holy
Virgin Mary; it survived in the Leuven Codex (in the



Mátéffy ͻͷ͹
last quarter of the thirteenth century) by the name of
The Lamentations of Mary (Ómagyar Mária
siralom)46.
In the Chronicon (Hungariae) Pictum the two
brothers Géza and Ladislaus I of Hungary (Saint
László) build a cathedral in respect of the “Blessed
Virgin” in other words to the Virgin Mary at the
location where they saw the deer, bearing an antler
filled with candles, (refer to: stars) disappears (Mark
of Kalt’s 2004: 82). This is the remainder motif (3) of
the changing (Ossetian, Central Eurasian Turkic origin
Persian, Hungarian origin Catalan variants, etc.) into
the form of a young girl. The princess from the Árpád
dynasty, the doe drinking from the well in Catalonian
folk songs, Violant of Hungary marries James I of
Aragon on September 8, 1235 (on the day of the
“Young Blessed Woman”—The day of the
Kisboldogasszony, in Hungarian), on the birthday of
Virgin Mary, in Barcelona (Thallóczy 1897: 586).
This also might be the part of the cult of the “Blessed
Woman” in the Árpád dynasty. Violant of Hungary is
so popular in Catalonia even this day, that each year
since 1424 on the week of September 24, they
organize the festival La Mercè47. In Csíksomlyó,
Transylvania (Historical Hungary, in today’s
Romania), they celebrate the Pentecost each year
hailing the Immaculate Virgin Mary as the Woman
dressed in the Sun (Tánczos 2010). Each year several
hundred thousands of Hungarians wander here from
all over the world to take part in the open-air mass and
procession and tell their requests to the statue of the
Woman dressed in the Sun in the Franciscan church.
The statue of grace is sculptured according to the
Mulier Amicta Sole iconography (12 stars are arrayed
above Mary’s head in the crescent moon holding his
son Jesus in her arms) was probably created between
1510 and 1515 (Tánczos 2010). “The much less
intellectual and much more emotional folk religious
approach... could accept and merge the immaculata
images prefered and idealized by the church and the
images of maternity reaching back to the pagan
goddesses of fertility, into one idea without any
hesitation” (Tánczos 2010). It is the usual rite of the
pilgrimage to Csíksomlyó that the Csángó ethnic
group of Hungarians in Moldavia look into the rising
sun on the dawn of Pentecost. Accoring to the beliefs
of the Csángós in Moldavia, on the dawn of Pentecost,
you can see the Holy Spirit, Virgin Mary and Jesus
Christ and other Saint entities flying away from the
eastern side of the hill of Kis-Somlyó in the form of
doves (Peti 2010).
CONCLUSIONS
As it could be seen clearly, the myths about the
Miracle Stag brought to the two regions of Europe, to
the Kingdom of Poland and to the Iberian Peninsula,
managed to spread with the agency of the conquering
Hungarians coming from the east and bringing their
oral tradition. The legend Queen Violant from the
Árpád dynasty (the Turul kindred) preserved (a sole
hunter, the girls changing into the doe, totemic
marriage) in 1235 remained alive through the
Hungarian oral tradition on the lands of Catalonia
even in the thirteenth century bearing the main marks
of the folkloric phenomenon on itself in different
variants. It is a well proved historical fact that this
existed 50 years earlier than the first Hungarian
writing version that would have been recorded by
Simon of Kéza in Latin.
The same is legitimized in several variations of the
Hungarian oral texts of rites and wedding ceremonies
which are similarly more archaic than the ones Simon
of Kéza recorded. Even today for the Hungarians the
Cult of Mary stands for the oral epics of Central Asia
and the Cult of the Ancestress they brought with the
rite scripts to Middle-Europe in the tenth century. This
pre-christian idea of ancestress (hind) had a great
influence on the forming of the Mulier Amicta Sole
iconography. Therefore the European Christian
legends of deer chasing have two sources: one is the
Byzantian tradition of the church founding and the



ͻͷ ͅ Sociology Study 2(12)
other is the Central Eurasian Hun and Hungarian deer
pursuing origin myths inspired by the Eurasian Cult of
Ancestress.

Notes
1. “The Chased Doe/Hind” (number: 401) (Berze Nagy 1957: 523, 525, 526, 532-545). 2. According to the author, the vulgar terminology of “Árpád dynasty” is not correct because Árpád (ca. 845-907 AD) wasn’t the first known member of this genealogy and this kindred had also important heroic persons before Árpád. “Among this captains Árpád the son of Előd son of Ügyek, of the Turul kindred...” (Veszprémy and Schaer 1999: 81). This false denomination descends from Ferenc Károly Palma (1770) and István Katona (1779) Jesuit regulars and historians (Szabados 2011: 363-368). The “Turul dynasty” or “Turul genera/kindred” is far better because the early Latin Chronicles of the Hungarian kings used this terminology for themselves: “de genere Turul”; “Turul, Hungarian kindred 81, 159” (Veszprémy and Schaer 1999: 227). The meaning of the Hungarian word turul (Old Turkic: toğrıl—“a bird of prey, exact identity unknown”; Clauson 1972: 472) is a bird of prey, probably a falcon. This is a totemic symbol of Huns and Hungarians. According to the Hungarian Chronicles, the forefather of the Hungarian “Turul genera” was Attila the Hun (Ethela rex Hunnorum). “King Attila’s banner bore the image of the bird the Hungarians call turul, with a crown on its head, and this emblem he carried on his own shield” (Veszprémy and Schaer 1999: 43). 3.

In the Erzurum version of the Bey Böyrek stories, it is found that “He finds a gazelle (ceylan; in the story later it is replaced by the expression geyik/deer) on the road..., but because it was beautiful, he wasn’t able to kill it” (Gökoğlu 1936). 12.

First publishing: Klaproth (1825). 23. This published the written copies in the original Arabian and Ottoman Turkish/Azeri dialects and the English translations made from them. The Ottoman-Turkish text was created from the original Persian one, as written on the XVI-XVII pages of the prologue of the English translation. In the prologue of this edition it is written that a study from 1726 writes first about Derbend-nâmeh by the academic Gottlieb Siegfried Bayer. The source mentions two settlements who live as the sixth century Sassanid Persian nobility, the Northern Caucasian, the Kitchi-Madjar ( ماجار کچى Kiči Maĵar) and the Oulou-Madjar ( اولو ماجار Ulu Maĵar; page 6) in the location of today’s Dagestan. Before the Hungarian Conquest (895 AD), these areas were the borderlands between the Persian and the Khazar Empire, near the Meotis Swamps. “And the region of Meotis lies next to Persis” (Simon of Kéza 2004: 91); “And hereby the region of Meotis is neighbouring to the country of Persia” (Mark of Kalt’s 2004: 82); “The animal however escaped and at the border of [the province] Adjem reaching the mountains, it disappeared” (Mahmūd 1988: 25). But in 651 AD the Sassanid Persia is defeated by the expanding Arabians, consequently the references of Simon of Kéza, Mark of Kalt’s and the Tārih-i Ungurūs to Persia must aim at an earlier period: between 528 and 651 AD. 24. “[In Catalonia] The younger the song collection, the fewer are the chances of finding any Hungarian relevance in the songs. Almost all of the newer folk songs are ‘actualized’, in the position of geographical locations newer, more frequently used names seep into: Lombardy, Londria, stb.
and the word Hungria slowly wears out. Opposing this, when the Hungria word turns up—as told by the Catalan folk song researchers, we can assume that we are talking about a very old song” (Brachfeld 1930: 65). 25. “This is the occasion when Her Grace the Queen Jolantha, daughter of the King of Hungary arrives to Barcelona where they celebrate for her wellbeing on the very day the Virgin Mother was born in September (8th of Sept.).

She came to celebrate her wedding there at the festival “Naduidad de Nuestra Señora”—The Birth of Our Lady from September [in that year]. The Bishop of Hungary, called Count/Earl Dionysio also came with her: he was kind to the Queen, so he stayed at her service...) (Thallóczy 1897: 586; Zurita 1968: 100). 26. “The history of the Catalonian literature starts as of most, with historical works. Among the Catalonian Chronicles, the Chronicles of King Jamce I is marked priorite... the figure of the Queen, Violant of Hungary from the Árpád dynasty, is depicted with the warmest colors in it. Since the significance of the story maintained during the centuries, the figure of the Hungarian queen lingered in the memory of the people of Catalonia. The chronicle was translated to foreign languages, therefore the figure of Violant remained as well-known after her death, then at the time of her marriage” (Brachfeld 1930: 27). 27. “There is a Catalonian narrative which is about the person of Violant. Its title is: Historia de la filla del rey d’Hongria (The History About the Daughter of the King of Hungary). However in this Catalonian narrative, the name Violant is not mentioned, in the closest related text in the library in the Vatican, first found by Emile Roy, then by the title of De Alixandre, Roy de Hongrie, in the study of La comédie sans titre [Etudes sur le théâtre français du XIVe et du XVe siecle] this version (275) the name of Jolánta (Violanta) Yole. Also found in the verse novels of the work Manekine (by Philippe de Rémi, 1265) as Joie” (Brachfeld 1930: 44-47). 28. “We should not forget about the Hungarian ladies who got to Barcelona and then to Valencia... How long did this little Hungarian world managed to endure in Valencia?

After half a century in 1286, the name of Bernat d’Hongria still appeared in the provincial Callora as a liege lord. In 1272 Nicolás d’Hongria was a canonicus of the Cathedral in Valencia. In 1277, on a trade contract, there was a woman named Saurina de Hungría remarkable for her untranslatable given name” (Vajay 1984: 408, 412). 29. “It is also ascribed to Violant, that the existance of the word Hungarian, as the general name of the Magyar people, managed to seep into the Catalonian public awareness” (Brachfeld 1930: 30). 30.

See Moravcsik (1927: 259): “In the Chronicle of the Byzantian Malalas (Dindorf 1831: 430-433), Gordas (Kurt?) takes on the Byzantian Christianity in 527/528 as the King of the Huns around the Bosphorus (in these days: Kerch, Ukraine) who are not ruled by the king named Muageris (Muad’er/Mod’er) at the time. For this reason from the aspect of the Byzantian and Armenian Christianity a newer converting campaign which happened at the habitat of the Kutrigur Huns in the Caucasians where they lived later. Also in later periods there were converting campaigns among the North Caucasian Huns (Eusebios (the fifth century); Zacharias Rhetor (cca. 465-cca. 536 AD); Israel, Bishop of Caucasian Albania, 682 AD; Moses Kalankatvatsi (the tenth century); etc.”. 37.
