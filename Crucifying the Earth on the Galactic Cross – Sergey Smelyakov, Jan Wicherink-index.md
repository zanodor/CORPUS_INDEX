CRUCIFYING THE EARTH ON THE GALACTIC CROSS

the Astronomical and Eight-pointed Crosses (See Supplements 1, 2)
1. INTRODUCTION
While the world is anticipating the effects of the End of the Maya Long Count Calendar on December 21 2012, they have already started to develop right in front of our eyes.
The Cross, in all its forms, presents the most ancient symbol, and a series of meanings stands behind each of them (See Supplement 1). Some of these meanings are not widely known until our days; some other ones are still veiling the ancient esoteric concepts. The meaning of the majority of these corresponds to astronomical facts and evolution of the Earth and mankind that was kept secret for millennia. But from the 19th century a significant part of these symbols was explained – partly due to the disclosing of the Ancient Knowledge in works of Helen Blavatsky, – partly due to the progress of the sciences. For this reason we may suggest that this disclosure, by itself, presents great importance defining the last two centuries as the age of great revelations; if so, we may expect that they are given purposefully, in order to prepare us for something important.
And we actually see this from a series of independent studies that the current decades can be characterised as the outstanding ones over the millennia; a series of seldom Space phenomena and the End of the Mayan calendar are evidently between them.
In 1996, the concept of the Solar System Zodiac (SZ) was developed as a natural affiliate to the Tropical Zodiac (TZ). By comparing these Zodiacs we see that at present days the Tropical Vernal Point comes to the sign of Capricorn in the SZ, and vice versa (Fig. 7). The obtained conclusion has allowed us to find the explanation for a wide spectrum of important world trends in Nature and society [1, Part 8].
In continuation of the previous studies devoted to (i) astronomical and esoterical analysis of the current decade with the use of the concept of the Zodiac and (ii) revealing of the concept of Time incorporated in the Ankh (the most Sacred Cross of the ancient Egypt) and the King's Chamber [1, Part 7], we show the direct evidences which reveal seemingly the most important astronomical meaning of the Astronomical Cross and, especially, of the Eight-pointed Cross.
In particular, the results of a comparative analysis are presented which show that bringing of these Zodiacs into physical and geometrical correspondence specifies the XX-correlation being symbolized by the Double Cross , the elements of which, in various combinations, engender the allied models treating the Galactic Equator at the current age, whereas the precessional coincidence of the axes of these Zodiacs defines the Great Celestial Conjunction – one of the four most prominent Celestial events for the Earth in a Platonic year of 26 000 Tropical years, which is symbolized by the Astronomical Cross .
An overview of the esoteric meaning of the different types of Crosses and detailed calculations are presented in Supplements 1 and 2, respectively.

2. TROPICAL ZODIAC
TZ as the Terrestrial Cross
By taking into account that the concepts of the Tropical and Solar Zodiacs are minutely described in [1, Part 8], together with a physical background and verification of the obtained results, in this article we concentrate on new results; the basic properties of these Zodiacs are given for clarity of discussion.
Though the general idea of the Tropical Zodiac is well-known, for the purpose of this study keep in mind the basic aspects of this concept, since it is used for synthesizing its generalization – the Solar System Zodiac (SZ, or Solar Zodiac, for short) instead of considering an uncertain concept of a Sidereal Zodiac.
Principally, the Tropical Zodiac (TZ) is determined by the Ecliptic and (Celestial) Equator.
The Ecliptic is a great circle on the Celestial sphere along which the Sun appears to travel in its journey around the Earth, taking one year to do so (here, the Sun presents the direct Hierarch for the Earth).
The Celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere around the Earth on which the stars in the sky are projected.
The (Celestial) Equator is also a great circle on the Celestial sphere; it lies in the plane being perpendicular to the Earth's own axis of rotation. The North Pole is the point where the Earth's axis intersects the Celestial sphere in the Northern hemisphere.
Since the rotation axis of the Earth is not perpendicular to the Earth’s orbital plane around the Sun but makes an angle  of about 23 degrees, known as the Obliquity of the Ecliptic (Fig. 1), the Equator and Ecliptic intersect on the Celestial Sphere. The two opposite points on the Celestial Sphere where they intersect are called (the points of) the Vernal  and Autumn  Equinoxes; the former one, the Tropical 0 point (TVP, or the First Point of Aries, 0 ), is that where the Sun's path along the Ecliptic crosses the Equator from South to North. The Equinoxes define the start of the spring and autumn seasons when the day and night equal in length (Latin: Aequi = equal, Noctium = night).
The line on the plane of Ecliptic which connects these two points is called the axis of Equinoxes; it presents the intersection of the planes of ecliptic ET and Equator T
Q.
Astronomically, the axis of Solstices presents the projection of the Earth's axis of rotation on the plane of Ecliptic; the respective points on the Ecliptic are called the Winter and Summer Solstices (Latin: Sol = Sun Stitium= stand still). For the Northern Hemisphere they define the moment of the year when the noon Sun has the lowest (highest) elevation. Note that in many mythologies the Winter Solstice is associated with the death and re-birth of Nature and various gods.
Mathematically, these cardinal axes of Solstices and Equinoxes are perpendicular one to another. For this reason they form a perfect cross on the plane of Ecliptic; call it the Terrestrial Cross.
This cross, as well as its cardinal points are of great importance in astrology: every object that arrives at any of these points acquires especial importance.
The examples which show the physical importance of the cardinal axes of the TZ are given in [1, Part 8], whereas the esoterical significance of these axes is described in Supplement 1.
By its structure, the sphere of influence of the Tropical Zodiac (TZ) is initially limited to the Earth: it is associated with the aura envelope of the Earth, through which, as via an inhomogeneous filter, different space objects exert their influence on its internal elements – from separate human beings to social structures and natural processes. The accuracy of parameters defining the mathematical model of the TZ is very high and bounded just by the exactness of astronomical measurements that specify the Earth’s orientation and orbit by the Equator and Ecliptic planes, respectively. Use of these two planes supplies both astronomy and astrology with conjugate Ecliptical/Equatorial coordinate systems [4] which uniquely define the place of the Celestial objects with respect to the Earth’s orientation in Space (Fig. 1). The first of them is used in astrology and theoretical astronomy, while the latter one is more convenient for astronomical observations as it adjusted to the daily rotation of the Earth.

Fig.1. The Equinoxes (, ) and Solstices (,) in the Ecliptical coordinate system
The ecliptic longitude  is measured from the vernal equinox  and runs (along the Ecliptic) from 0° to 360° in the same eastward sense as Right Ascension . As the Equatorial longitude, R.A. can take values between 0 and 360 deg., though more often it is given in time units: hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s), where 24 hours correspond to 360 degrees (so that R.A. takes values between 0 and 24 h). Note that the ecliptic longitude of Sun coincides with its Equatorial longitude just at these four cardinal points ( ).
In its absolute form, the Zodiac is the unity that determines the universal cycle of transformation of energy (along the Ecliptic). This is present in two forms: (1) in static form, when considering separate zones of equal length, and (2) in dynamic form, when the origin and the end merge together, thus generating the fulcrum called the First Point of Aries. But the Entity being contained in it could be divided with the use of different numerological keys – 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, and even 360. Each key defines the concept of dividing the entire cycle into phases and their esoteric meanings. Thus it is commonly accepted (and certified esoterically) that the Zodiac comprising 12 signs most properly reflects the evolutionary stages of the Earth, as shown in the production of trinity and quaternary (viz. spiritual and material, etc.).
Thus with respect to the structure of the TZ – the Terrestrial Cross within the circle of Ecliptic – we can conclude, that the Astronomical cross (viz. the four-point orthogonal cross within the circle, as well as number 4) actually define its essence.
Precession of the Equinoxes and Wobbling of the Ecliptic
Due to the precession of the Equinoxes the Earth's axis makes a complete revolution around the Ecliptic over a period of Platonic year (approximately 26 000 Tropical years). However, it does not describe a circle shown in Fig. 2.a, but one inward turn along a spiral; during this period, the Ecliptic's axis travels several degrees over the celestial sphere (Fig. 3).
As far as the Earth’s rotation and precession do not follow a uniform law, there is no possibility to reliably estimate the precession for an epoch spaced far enough from the period of astronomical observations. For example, the variation in Obliquity over the last 50 years makes -23'' (See Supplement 2).
This means that for an epoch being a cycle of precession apart from the present, the existing approximations lose their consistence. The more so for the precession of the Ecliptic with the Sun's revolution period of 230 million years.

“Fixed Stars” and the Weak Points of the “Eternal” Sidereal Zodiac (SiZ)
The Sidereal Zodiac also presents the circle of Ecliptic, but with a fixed origin. For this reason its cardinal axes have nothing in common with the Solstices and Equinoxes.
When considering or postulating a correlation between the Sidereal Zodiac’s origin and some star, rarely does an author take account of the proper motion of the stars. This motion is significantly less than the precessional correction for the Equatorial coordinate of stars that makes about 50’’ a year. However, a proper motion may be relatively large even for a human’s life. Now, more than 330 stars are known with a proper motion exceeding 1′′ a year. Average  (in seconds of arc per year) for the stars of magnitude of
up to 6 m is about 0.1′′; e.g. (Regulus,  Leo) = 0.24′′ a year, (Sirius,  Canis Major)= 1.32′′ a year.
Over a Platonic year, the total motion that the majority of stars make is up to 1 (in average), and 7 to 70° for several hundreds of the most rapid ones. Much more significant variations in the firmament would take place even after two precession cycles (Fig. 4).

Therefore, not only a Platonic year, but even one zodiacal age causes significant variations in the coordinates of the stars. That is why it makes no sense to consider either the stars, or the boundaries of the constellations for the reference points for such time intervals.
Hence, if some star is chosen to present the “ancient” Sidereal Zodiac's origin, in addition to the uncertain correction to an irregular precession and wobbling of the Ecliptic, we must take account of its proper motion. Who does this? In reality, the considered estimates for the Origin of such Zodiacs differ by dozens of degrees, and even in India, where it is widely used, these estimates differ by as much as a few degrees.
Besides, no consent exists neither with the subject of SiZ's sphere of influence (whether it is Earth, Solar System, or Galaxy), nor with the esoterical meaning of its origin. Moreover, the 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° points of any Sidereal Zodiac DO NOT REFLECT CRITICAL POSITIONS OF THE SUN as the respective (by coordinate) TZ's cardinal points do!
Therefore it is not clear why we should give preference to some uncertain "fixed" point, if a series of actual factors of a physical, mathematical and esoterical natures provide evidence that the current orientation of the Earth does actually reflect the Solar and Space influence. For this reason any SiZ should actually be considered as nothing more than an Ecliptic coordinate system with an arbitrary origin.
By allowing for the Ancient esoterical, geometrical and astronomical considerations being overviewed in Supplement 1 we can conclude the following.
Resume 1.
1. The axes of the Tropical Zodiac are effectual from both physical and esoterical points of view: the Solstice line presents the Ecliptic projection of the Earth's axis of rotation, whereas the line of Equinoxes presents the intersection of the planes of Ecliptic and Equator. To this end the perfect cross made of these lines, named the Terrestrial Cross, presents the exact replica of the Stauros , or the four-armed, or philosophical cross.
2. When the Terrestrial Cross is united with the engendering Ecliptic, the structure of the TZ becomes the Astronomical cross , or the Cross of the World, or, in other presentation – the Ankh, or Crux
ansata .
3. By allowing for the direction of rotation of these axes and taking account that they point to the four cardinal points, we obtain the Swastica , or Decussated cross .
4. By its direct construction, the TZ is reflected by the cross of double glyph which is presented as the cross of the two equinoxes and the two solstices placed within the figure of the earth's path.
5. Last, but not least are the multiple references to the 0° as the point of the Winter Solstice; this means that it was namely the Tropical Zodiac which was considered in the esoteric concepts, because the Sun passes the point 0° at Winter Solstice just in the TZ: in any Sidereal Zodiac this point, 0°, has nothing in common with this event ("dieing Sun" at the shortest day of the year) except once in 26 000 years.

3. THE SOLAR SYSTEM ZODIAC, SZ
Geometry of Space Influence
As we may see this from a series of sound examples [1, Parts 1, 8], Space matter and objects exert their influence anisotropically, first of all - from definite directions and within definite planes. Within the Solar System, these are basically (i) the plane of Ecliptic ET , and (ii) its axis that passes through the North
Pole of Ecliptic. For the Earth, the similar objects are: (iii) the plane of Equator T
Q and (iv) the Earth’s
axis of rotation, AE , that passes through the geographical North Pole (NP) being also the NP for the
Equatorial coordinate system.
The axis AE and the plane T
Q define the basic elements of symmetry both for the Globe and for its
Space shield - electromagnetic envelope and radiation layers. In particular, the Geomagnetic field directs the charged Space matter to the Poles (The relevance of the Poles in the Space-Earth interaction is supported by the Secret Doctrine [1, Part 6]).
Within the Solar System, the Earth and the other planets interact between themselves and the Sun in the plane of Ecliptic. At the same time, all these Heavenly objects experience the same influence, the Galactic Centre and other Galactic objects exert on them, e.g. from the Southern Pole of Ecliptic. From this point of view, the Solar System (SS) as a whole is called the Heliosphere. Hence, the plane of Ecliptic ET and
its axis also present the basic elements of symmetry for the Solar System through which the outer Space exerts its influence on the interior of the Heliosphere.
Though the basic interactions within the Solar System is realized in the plane of Ecliptic, the actuality of the Southern direction for the Solar System is also emphasized. As to the Earth, pay attention to its electromagnetic and gas/plasma envelopes and their foci - the Polar regions through which the radiation material (plasma) inflows and discharges, and the electrical nature of the basic interaction mechanism which is a topic for subsequent considerations. Researchers are now insisting more, and more, that the Earth's temperature increases are dependent upon, and directly linked to, space-terrestrial interactions; be it Earth-Sun, Earth-Solar System, and/or Earth-Interstellar.
It is known that electromagnetic interactions play a great part in the interaction of the heavenly bodies. At this, the Sun and comets exert their influence to the Earth through its magnetosphere, and the TZ, by its structure, reflects the mechanism of this interaction.
For example, an analysis [1, Part 8] of the growing discrepancy between the Earth's rotation and magnetic axes shows that (i) the TZ may work now in other ways than it did a few centuries ago, and (ii) the increasing discrepancy can cause instability effects in the Earth processes. (This situation might be likened to a positive feedback that is described by the rise in mechanical wobbling being caused by irregular wear or a broken rotating part: the more the wobble, the more the wear, and vice versa).
Therefore, the Equator and Ecliptic planes, as well as their axes, define the conjugate geometric elements that specify the channels through which the Space exerts its physical influence on the Earth, whereas the Ecliptic defines the plane where the physical interaction between the planets and Sun takes place. As far as these elements define the geometrical structure of the TZ, the line of Equinoxes being specified by the crossing of these planes becomes the focus of this structure, whereas the TZ’s Solstice line presents the projection of the Solar System axis.
Hence, the cardinal points of the Tropical Zodiac and the TZ itself are adjusted to the current orientation of the Globe (that makes them the natural reference points for the Earth) and present the objective “channels”, or most sensitive foci of perception, through which the Space and Solar System’s objects exert their physical influence on the Earth. Therefore, we may conclude that the analogous structure being adjusted to the Solar System peculiarities may describe the foci for the Solar System, which carry out the same function from both the physical and esoterical points of view.

The Concept of the SZ
The whole of the Universe is saturated with the principle of Hierarchy, both esoterically and physically: each system level presents a hierarchical system of being, and retains an element of the whole.
On the one hand, the Solar System presents a vital-mechanical organic entity where the Sun acts as the heart and brain of the Solar World, or Solar sphere [1, Part 6]. Within our hierarchical Solar sphere chain, which includes the Earth, the Heavenly bodies influence the terrestrial objects through the TZ (viz. the Earth’s Aura, or Earth's electromagnetic envelope), but in different ways: if the Solar sphere's objects act directly through the TZ, the energies from outside the Solar sphere are filtered or transformed through the Solar System envelopes, or Aura. The Aural Egg of the Solar System rotates around the axis of the Ecliptic like the Aural Egg of the Globe rotates around the Earth’s axis, whereas both of them revolve around their Hierarchs – the Galactic Centre and Sun, respectively.
On the other hand, the series of Examples [1, Part 8] shows that the geometry of physical interactions between the Galaxy and the Solar System, and between the latter one and the Earth follow the same structural model the elements of which present the foci of physical influence, where the same plane of Ecliptic presents the governing element for the system of the lower level (viz. Earth) and the internal element for the system of the upper level (viz. Galaxy).
Therefore, with respect to the Hermetic axiom, "as above, so below; as below, so above", we cannot exclude the existence of a Solar System Zodiac which carries out the "same" function from the perspective of the Sun, as the TZ does from the perspective of the Earth.
Solar System’s Position in the Galaxy
The general structure of the Galaxy is depicted in Fig. 5.a. It presents a flattened system being symmetrical relative to the basic plane called the Galactic Plane. Intersection of the latter one with the Celestial sphere gives the Galactic equator, which actually coincides with the mean line of the Milky Way.
The Galaxy rotates around its axis passing through the Galactic Center (GC), the Galactic North Pole
(G
NP ) of which is projected to the constellation Coma Berenices (Table S2.1).
The Galactic Centre is the rotational center of the Milky Way galaxy. When observed from the Solar System, it is projected to the constellation Sagittarius (Table S2.2).
In their average planes of revolution, being perpendicular to the axis of the Galaxy, the Sun and stars move around the GC so that at any moment the course of each object is perpendicular to the direction of the GC; this revolution is clockwise from the side of the G
NP . As to the Solar System, it completes its
revolution around the GC in a Galactic Year which makes approximately 200 – 230 million Earth’s years.
Meanwhile, in its local galactic vicinity, the Sun moves (Fig. 5.b) towards the point on the Celestial sphere which is called the Solar apex; at present, it is projected to the constellation Hercules (Table S2.3).
The North Pole of Ecliptic E
NP is projected to the constellation Draco; this point also moves along the
Celestial sphere, but very slowly (Fig. 3). Though the plane of Ecliptic is defined by the Earth’s orbital plane, the orbital planes of the massive planets are inclined to the Ecliptic at a relatively small angle: approximately by 0 for Uranus and Neptune, 1.3 for Jupiter and only for Saturn it makes 2.5 . By analogy with the Galactic Equator this allows us to consider the Ecliptic as the Solar System’s Equator which defines the average plane of the Solar System.

The Structure of the Solar System’s Zodiac
Describe the structure of the Solar System’s Zodiac (SZ) by resemblance with the Tropical one (applicable to the Earth presenting the element of the Solar System) and with respect to the axiom "as above, so below; as below, so above" applied to the one level higher hierarchy – to the Solar System. In this case the basic SZ elements must relate to the Solar System as the TZ's ones – to the Earth.
Thus since the planets revolve around the Sun in approximately the plane of Sun-Earth Ecliptic ET , we
take it for the plane of the Solar System’s Equator S
Q and call its axis that of the Solar System. Since our
Solar System moves in a circular movement around the Galactic Center, we regard the latter the direct Hierarch for the Solar System and take the plane of the Galactic Equator, in which our Solar System revolves around the Galactic Center, for the “Galactic Ecliptic” ES .
As in the case with the TZ, the intersection of the planes ES and S
Q gives the straight line on the Ecliptic
plane which defines the axis of Equinoxes Z and Z’ for the SZ. Since the direction to the Galactic North Pole G
NP is normal to the plane of the Galactic Ecliptic ES , its projection FF (Galactic Solstice axis) to
the plane of the Solar System Equator (viz. conventional Ecliptic) S
Q is perpendicular to the line of in
tersection ZZ (Galactic Equinox axis) of these planes and defines the Solstices F and F for the SZ. It is clear that for the SZ the physical meaning of Equinoxes and Solstices is the same as for the TZ (Fig. 6.a).
As in the case with the TZ, the cardinal axes of the Solar Zodiac form a perfect cross, both on the plane of the Galactic Equator, and on the plane of Ecliptic; call it the Galactic Cross.
These are those planes and directions through which the Galaxy actually exerts its influence and through which this influence is redistributed: - as the Sun at a cardinal point defines the start of the respective season of the Terrestrial year, so does the Galactic Centre when it comes to a cardinal point of the Solar Zodiac, but for the Solar System as a whole. Note, that now it is only 3° off SZ's Equinox Z (and the TZ's Winter Solstice as they coincide); - the projection to the Ecliptic (viz. the Ecliptic longitude) of the significant points from the Celestial sphere presents, as the millennia of astrological experience acknowledge, almost the same significance as these points themselves, and therefore these projections are used.
XX-Correlation
As far as the velocity of the TZ’s precession is by several orders of magnitude greater than that for the SZ (over a Platonic year, the Earth’s axis makes a complete circle of 360 , whereas the G
NP shifts by sev
eral degrees only), for the current age the cardinal points of the SZ may be considered immobile.
Since the cardinal points of the SZ are mutually orthogonal and precess synchronously along the Ecliptic with an average speed of 50'' a year, we may unite the Galactic and Terrestrial Crosses into a single concept – XX-correlation. At some moment these two crosses coincide synchronously because each cardinal point of SZ is as distant from the nearest cardinal point of TZ (Fig. 6.a) as the point Z from 0 .
Therefore, four times a Platonic year, viz. each 6500 years in average, the rotating Galactic Cross coincides with the Terrestrial Cross. Call this event the Great Celestial Conjunction (GCC); one of these events takes place at present; the point and interval estimates (Suppl. 2) for its epoch are as follows
P
GCC = J1998.3475, or May 7, 1998, (1)
19.5
GCC = P
GCC  TS = J1998.3  19.5  { 1978.8 , 2017.8 }, (2)
39
GCC = P
GCC  2  TS = J1998.3  2 19.5  { 1959.3 , 2037.3 }. (3)
Meanwhile, although the GCC takes place four times a Platonic year, the importance of the current event may probably be the largest since both the Galactic Centre (the "Sun" for our Solar System) and the Solar Apex longitudes, apart from a series of nebulae (Fig. 6.b) are allocated in the close vicinity of the cardinal point 0° = 270° (Tables S2.2, S2.3) whereas the latter point of the TZ presents the "Birth of the Sun", or the origin of the Tropical year. For this reason it may be considered as the Origin of the Platonic year.

The SZ in Reference to TZ
Now, the principal question arises, whether it is the point Z or Z' that have to be taken for the Origin of the SZ. It is the northern hemisphere that provides dominant influence over the Earth [1, Parts 6, 8]. But the Sun's toroidal field and the Solar System as a whole might be likened to a flat circular aerial, which is tuned to both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, with respect to the Principle of Hierarchy, the Sun, as the heart and brain of the Solar System [1, Part 6], must first be oriented to its Hierarch, to the Galactic Centre. Since the Sun is located above the Galactic Equator, the Solar System is observed to be North from the GC, relative to the Galaxy's North Pole. Besides, physical observations show definite dominance of the Southern direction in the Space influence (See Example in [1, Part 8]).
This fact, as well as the concentration of the principally important objects (GC, Solar Apex. etc.) in the close vicinity of the SZ's Equinox point Z allows us to suppose that namely this Equinox point should be taken for the "Vernal" point, that is for the Origin of the SZ; denote it S.
As the universal cycle, any Zodiac allows division by the different key numbers – 4 (elements), 12 (presenting the Signs as 30°-arcs), etc. However, as far as the number 12 presents a universal importance, we can divide (e.g. for convenience of comparison of these two Zodiacs) the SZ into a 12 signs as well. But whatever number of signs we use, or do not use, the SZ’s cardinal points remain orthogonal and retain their principal significance. For this reasons the correspondence between the cardinal points of the TZ and SZ remains correct, whatever SZ's division is used.
Last, but not least is the following. Relative to the point of observation in the Galaxy’s North Pole, the visible traffic direction of the Galactic Centre around the Sun along the Galactic Ecliptic ES is clockwise, while the visible traffic direction of our Sun around any planet (in the same plane ET = S
Q ) is anti
clockwise. Therefore, in the TZ and SZ the longitudes are incremented in the opposite directions.
In order to visualize (Fig. 7) the obtained correspondence between these two Zodiacs, consider the SZ's projection on the Ecliptic against the TZ for the current epoch which follows the GCC of (1).

The arrow at T (0° Aries) indicates the direction of actual precessional displacement of the TZ along the SZ after the conjunction of their cardinal axes at the GCC (1). Note that the angle between the respective cardinal points of the TZ and SZ makes several minutes of arc for the current epoch: it is grossly exaggerated for illustrative purpose

What Influence does the SZ Exert on the Earth?
The most intriguing thing in Fig. 7 is the symmetry in behaviour of the Origins T , S : the First Point of Aries S (T ) of the SZ (TZ) has completed its path through Sagittarius of TZ (SZ, Resp.) at the GCC (1) and started its travel through the Capricorn (!)
In compliance with the conventional astrological approach, coming of the point of T to the cusp of a Zodiacal sign means starting of the Age named by this sign. Since the cardinal points of the SZ and TZ has coincided in May 1998 with respect to (1), or have to coincide in the current Era of GCC, 19.5
GCC
(2) within the Age of Transformations 39
GCC (3), we may conclude that transfer to a New Age is un
der way, but for what Age? The bringing of the SZ into correlation with the TZ (Fig. 7) shows, that the situation is much more surprising than coming to the Age of Aquarius; it rather forced us to submit the following three hypotheses.
Hypothesis SZ-1. The vernal points S and T are symmetrically completing their way through the Sagittarius signs (viz. S through the TZ Sagittarius, and T through the SZ Sagittarius). This brings us to the end of the Age of Sagittarius, not the Age of Pisces.
Hypothesis SZ-2. The forthcoming age is the Age of Capricorn, since the vernal points S, T are symmetrically approaching both the TZ and SZ Capricorn signs, and so, the transfer to the New Age is taking place now – with the coming of the new millennium!
Hypothesis SZ-3. The sign of Aquarius takes on special significance for the Earth, since both the Tropical and the SZ’s signs of Aquarius overlap. This situation might be interpreted as the undistorted (and, hence, magnified) passing of Aquarian energies to Earth, enhanced by the present influence of Uranus.
The arguments in support of these Hypotheses are presented in [1, Part 8]. In general, they demonstrate a synchronism of the Change-of-Ages Concepts and include both astrophysical and historical analysis, as well as esoterical and astrological considerations. In particular, it is shown how the comets arrive in unison with the Solar cycles, and the latter ones – with the oscillation of the hypernova Eta Carinae.
The orthogonality of the SZ and TZ axes at the GCC has evidently caused a change in both the flux and polarities of the energies radiated from the Galaxy to the Earth. To clarify this point, just think what happens when you stick your hand out of the window of a driving car. When you hold your hand orthogonal to the direction of travel of the car, you will get the maximum flux of the wind energy that will be experienced as drag, but when hold your hand parallel to the direction of travel, almost no drag is experienced. This is also why we align a solar panel perpendicular to the solar rays to get the maximum flux and the highest efficiency. This is what’s been happening on a Galactic scale with the Earth, the ‘solar panel’ has been aligned such that we’re experiencing a different Galactic energy flux radiated from the GC.
We surmise that a relation may also exist between the GCC and global warming. Research starts to reveal that not carbon dioxide emissions are the root cause of global warming, but extraterrestrial influences from Space. Also both the overall and Earth-directed effects of Solar activity has increased in intensity in the past decade. On Earth these energetic changes are reflected in the change of weather patterns and upsurges in volcanic and seismological activity; By using the Sun and cardinal points of TZ as a lens, the Galactic energies may be causing a rise in global political instability, increase in wars and a growing polarization between clashing religions. Research strongly suggests a direct relation between the years of Solar maximum and an upsurge of violence on the planet. (For more detail on these effects See Parts 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 of [1]).
But here we should like to emphasise now those new aspects of the GCC that pertain to Resume 1.

Resume 2.
1. The Stauros , as well as the Astronomical cross and various types of the Ankh represent the Solar Zodiac equally with the TZ; in this sense the Galactic Cross is symbolically "equal" to the Terrestrial Cross.
2. The correlation of the cardinal axes of both these Zodiacs is evidently represented by the Double or Eight-pointed cross both geometrically, and numerically, and esoterically. At this the Decussated cross, , may present the Terrestrial cross being crucified over the Stauros, , presenting the Galactic one.
3. The SZ-TZ correlation seemingly presents the first important model which discloses the mysterious origin of the Double cross, the esoteric nature of which is described incompletely, not to say very faintly.
4. As far as the considered types of the crosses and respective concepts of world periods and Sun are found throughout the world in the artefacts of Maya, Egypt, India, etc., we can conclude that they were aware about the Solar Zodiac, XX-Correlation and GCC, in this or that presentation of these concepts.
5. For these reasons the Double Cross can be taken for the symbol of the united action of these two crosses, Terrestrial and Galactic ones, that is – for the XX-Correlation, whereas the Astronomical cross - for the symbol of the Great Celestial Conjunction presenting the event of superposition of these two crosses, or, in a descriptive form, the Galactic Crucifixion of the Earth. To this end we express our hope that the title of this article actually reflects the re-birthing of the Terrestrial life in the Theosophical sense (See Supplement 1).
4. THE ALLIED MODELS
The concept of the SZ was firstly published in 1996 [5]. After then, it was replenished with extra examples and grounding [6, 7]. However, it was known, but mainly to astrologers. For this reason it makes sense to compare it with the allied ones – with the Galactic Alignment (GA) [8], "Holy Cross" {of the TZ Equinox and Galactic Equator axes} (HC) [9], and with the Cross of Hendaye [10].
THE GALACTIC ALIGNMENT. The definition of the first concept is as follows [8]:
"The Galactic Alignment is the alignment of the December solstice sun with the
Galactic equator. (4) This alignment occurs as a result of the precession of the equinoxes. ... Because the sun is one-half of a degree wide, it will take the December solstice sun 36 years to precess through the Galactic equator. (5)
Thus, the Galactic Alignment "zone" is
1998 +/- 18 years = 1980 - 2016. This is "era-2012." ". (6)
As it is well known, the Winter Solstice is defined as the moment when the Sun coincides with the cardinal point 0° (WS); this event takes place when the Sun's coordinate makes exactly =180° 0' 0'' in Ecliptic longitude, or  =18h 0m 0s (viz. 180° 0' 0'') in R.A.
For this reason the GA is the event which may take place, but once a year – around December 21 (the exact moment depends on the year). By definition, it does not take into consideration the similar alignment on the Summer Solstice; neither does it consider the Sun at the TZ's Equinoxes which are close to the SZ's Solstice axis presenting the axis of rotation of the Galaxy. With this in mind we obtain the following corrected (Supplement 2) point and interval estimates for the Galactic Alignment instead of (6):

Epoch of the Galactic Alignment (point estimate)
P
GA = { December 21, 1997; GMT 20:07}; (7)

I
GA = { ( Dec. 22, 1975; GMT 11:46 ) , ( Dec. 22, 2019; GMT 4:21) }. (8)
At the same time, by allowing for the point of intersection of the Ecliptic and Galactic Equator instead of the tangent to the Solar disc we obtain more adequate interval estimate for the GA:
S
GA = { (Dec. 22, 1978), (Dec. 21, 2016) }. (9)
THE "HOLY CROSS" (HC) STRUCTURE IS AS FOLLOWS [9].
"Just as Earth nests within our solar system, so too does our solar system nest safely within the care of our galaxy."... "These three intersecting astrophysical planes, the galactic plane, the ecliptic plane, and the Earth's equatorial plane, all tilted at unique angles to one another, create the geometric orientation of the two intersecting lines or cross members of the Holy Cross. Due to Earth's precessional wobble, and the subsequent wobble of Earth's Celestial Equatorial Plane, one cross member rotates around the ecliptic ring while the other remains stationary--creating the ~25,000 year "Cycle of the Holy Cross." The timing of this cyclic movement determines when the moving cross member is perpendicular to the stationary one, thus creating the perfect or erect cross. There are two erect crosses occurring in the cycle, both create primary transition points in the cycle and in our evolutionary unfoldment. One cross occurred about 12,000 years ago, the other is the astrophysical event occurring NOW."
"The Holy Cross is often depicted in ancient esoteric societies, as well as in sacred religious orders of today, quite simply, as a cross in a circle--or in some minor variance of this cardinal form. ...
The Holy Cross is not only a spiritual symbol, it is also the astronomical symbol for planet Earth. The cosmic significance of this symbol is that it marks the timing of a primary transition or turning in the natural evolutionary cycle of the Earth. Hidden within this symbol is a map referring to a unique occurrence of a specific geometric relationship between Earth, the solar system, and our galaxy--an astrophysical event occurring now, within Earth's ~25,920 year, precessional cycle. ..."
"The erect cross ... centers "around" 1999/2000 AD"
The correlation between the HC and GCC is described below in terms of the XX-correlation, as the former is composed of the TZ Equinox and SZ Equinox axes.
CROSS OF HENDAYE. According to the writers Jay Weidner and Vincent Bridges in their book ‘The Mysteries of the Great Cross at Hendaye; Alchemy and the End of Time‘ [10], the cross of Hendaye (See Photo at the title of the Article and Supplement 1) supposedly encodes some catastrophic event that is supposed to happen on Earth and this event is related to the Earth’s precession cycle. One of the important symbols on the cross are the double X figures on top of this cross which actually present the Eight pointed Cross (See Photo on the right) The XX-correlation/GCC offers a simple and straightforward explanation for the combination of these two types of the Cross of Hendaye. So we may suggest that Fulcanelli was actually aware of some clues to ancient secrets that were kept in the Hermetic vaults of secret societies. This Cross (See Supplement 1) may indeed be a marker of great changes related to the precession of the Equinoxes and this rare event – the Great Celestial Conjunction.



C r u c i f y i n g t h e E a r t h o n t h e G a l a c t i c C r o s s 16
5. CONCLUSIONS
1. The concept of the Solar Zodiac extends the well-known model of the Tropical Zodiac (being inherent to the Earth) to the Solar System with respect to the Hermetic axiom, "as above, so below; as below, so above". In this sense the SZ carries out the "same" function from the perspective of the Sun, as the TZ does from the perspective of the Earth.
The principal elements of the SZ's image are the axes of "Solstices" and "Equinoxes" (or the cardinal points with the same names). By resemblance with the TZ, these cardinal axes are defined by the planes of Ecliptic (analogue of Equator in TZ) and Galactic Equator (analogue of Ecliptic in TZ).
As these TZ's cardinal axes define the most important "channels" through which the outer influence is transferred to the Earth, so we can presume that the SZ axes act, but relative to the Solar System objects.
2. Due to the known physical and esoterical importance of the TZ's cardinal axes for the Terrestrial life, and in compliance with the analogy between the TZ and SZ we come to the conclusion that the precession-caused coinciding of these axes named the Great Celestial Conjunction (GCC) presents great importance to the Earth as such that opens the "Gate" for the Galactic influence.
3. The GCCs take place four times a Precessional cycle (Platonic year), viz. every 6500 years, but the current one is seemingly to be considered as the Origin of this cycle since the TZ's Winter Solstice point is also close to the Galactic Centre and Solar Apex (the latter object is not considered in other concepts).
4. It is shown that the considered axes, together with the circle of Ecliptic, are reflected in the basic types of Cross, including the Astronomical cross. Moreover, it is shown that the most probable meaning of the mystical eight-pointed cross (whose nature remained almost unclear) is the XX-Correlation, viz. the unity of all four cardinal axes of these two Zodiacs – the SZ and TZ, whereas the more profound meaning of the Astronomical cross presents the GCC event.
For this reason the Astronomical Cross may be considered as a graphical emblem for the GCC, whereas the Eight-pointed Cross – as the symbol for the XX-correlation.
5. With respect to Sections 2, 3, and Theosophical meaning of Crucifixion, the event of the GCC may be considered as renewal of all spheres of the Terrestrial life by the extra-Solar System influence, whatever name is used for this concept at present; as no process develops instantly, the obtained intervals (2), (3) for the "exact" moment (1) of the GCC show the most probable period of intensive transformations.
6. By allowing for the Mayan Cosmogenesis pertaining to the Death of the 4th period of the Sun and other concepts, the crosses found in America signifying the GCC provide one more piece of evidence to the Galactic equator significance before the end of the Mayan calendar in 2012; however, we may suggest that due to a relatively high instability of the Obliquity their date, 2012, was specified not only on the approximation of the Obliquity, or they used an average value of this parameter for fitting the interval of transformations.
In either case the 2012 gets more grounds of becoming a point of bifurcation within the current age (1) (3) of intensive transformations.
7. The concepts of XX-correlation, Galactic Alignment (GA) and "Holy Cross" (HC) have much in common. Though each of these three concepts deals with the Galactic Equator and Tropical Equator intersections with the Ecliptic, they differ both in their numerical and symbolical aspects.
By definition, the Galactic Alignment is the Winter Solstice Sun intersected by the Galactic Equator. This means that the GA considers just the moments of the Winter Solstices being 1 year distant one from another within the time interval of "era-2012". For this reason it does not consider the Solstice axis by itself; neither does it consider the Summer Solstice Alignment, nor the coincidence of the Galactic Equator with the TZ's Equinox axis: it deals with only two of the four XX-correlations over a Platonic year.
As to the actual motion of the Sun along the Ecliptic ("transiting Sun"), the GA treats it just at the discrete moments of the Winter Solstices and has nothing in common with the remaining three cardinal points of the coincided Tropical and Solar Zodiacs which the transiting Sun passes each year.
Besides, use of more exact interpolation for calculation of the GA epoch (within the definition of the GA) has allowed us to correct significantly the epoch of this event and the time interval of era-2012.



C r u c i f y i n g t h e E a r t h o n t h e G a l a c t i c C r o s s 17
8. Astronomically, the "Holy Cross" is the orthogonal cross on the plane of Ecliptic that comprises two lines presenting the intersections of the Ecliptic plane with the Tropical Equator and Galactic Equator planes.
From this point of view the HC presents the Equinox axes of the Tropical and Solar Zodiacs and does not take into account the Solstice axes of these Zodiacs. For this reason it, as the HC, also considers only two of the four XX-correlations in a Platonic year, which are synchronous with the GA.
Numerically, the concept of the HC is quite arbitrarily attached to the period of 1999/2000.
Though we see that the Astronomical cross relates to the HC, we cannot ignore the fact that the elements of the HC belong to qualitatively different structures relative to the level of hierarchy: to the Earth and to the Galaxy. For this esoterically important reason we prefer to consider the situation with the different types of Cross as it was formulated in Resumes 1 and 2.
9. In accordance with the accepted principle, the position of the Tropical Vernal Point in the outer (e.g. Sidereal) Zodiac specifies the properties of a new Age with respect to the sign where this point resides. In this sense the four Great Celestial conjunctions define four Ages of the Platonic year, one of which is starting right now and have the properties described in Hypotheses SZ-1 – SZ-3. These four Ages are evidently nothing else than the Fulcanelli's Four Ages comprising four quadrants of the Precessional year; the more so he considers the "The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye" connecting the macrocosm and the microcosm as a mechanism showing how and when the Universe changes its influence toward the Earth.
10. Finally, we may resume that the basic conclusions that result from the concept of the Double-cross correlation (based on the correlation of the Solar and Tropical Zodiacs) at the age of the Great Celestial Conjunction correspond to the existing physical and social state of the Earth, as well as to the Ancient Theosophical concepts relative to the astronomical meaning of different types of Cross. For this reason we may suggest that since the ancient times and throughout the world the Eight-pointed cross was used for presenting the concept of the XX-correlation, whereas the Astronomical cross , in its most profound sense, – was used for the concept of the Great Celestial Conjunction; this is apart from the other symbols that were considered alongside.
Further evidences in support of these conclusions are to appear at [1, Page 7: ATS in the artefacts of Egypt].

SUPPLEMENT 1
AN OUTLINE OF ESOTERICAL ROOTS OF THE BASIC TYPES OF CROSS
The aim of this Supplement is to review the basic types of Cross and their ancient esoteric meaning. It is based on the quotes from [2, 3], but also includes the results of other scientists; those of them, whom H.P.B. cites, are cross referenced via [2, 3] due to a rarity of their books. Authors' comments are braced.
S1.1. Identity of the Basic Symbols of the Cross and their Esoteric Meaning all over the Globe
The evolution and correlation of the mysteries of the Kosmos, of its growth and development – spiritual and physical, abstract and concrete – were first recorded in geometrical changes of shape. Every Cosmogony began with a circle, a point, a triangle, and a cube, up to number 9, when it was synthesized by the first line and a circle – the Pythagorean mystic Decade, the sum of all, involving and expressing the mysteries of the entire Kosmos; recorded a hundred times more fully in the Hindu system, for him who can understand its mystic language. ... One recognizes them in the caves and rock-cut temples of Hindostan and Central Asia, as in the pyramids and lithoi of Egypt and America; in the Catacombs of Ozimandyas, in the mounds of the Caucasian snowcapped fastnesses, in the ruins of Palenque, in Easter Island, everywhere whither the foot of ancient man has ever journeyed [2, V.1, P.321].
"Verily may the Cross be traced back into the very depths of the unfathomable Archaic Ages! Its Mystery deepens rather than clears, as we find it on the statues of Easter Island – in old Egypt, in Central Asia, engraved on rocks as Tau and Swastica, in pre-Christian Scandinavia, everywhere!" [2, V.2, P.557].
TAU . The evolution of humanity in the Third and Fourth Races is designated as and , respectively; whereas the second symbol presents the first and the earliest Egyptian Tau ; after then, it becomes which means separation of sexes and fall into engender, or physical Space.
STAUROS . Each nation which had an astronomical system held the Cross in high respect. "The fourarmed Cross is simply the cross of the four quarters, but the cross sign is not always simple" {Certainly not; for very often there are symbols made to symbolize other symbols, and these are in turn used in ideographs – H.P.B.}. This is a type that was developed from an identifiable beginning, which was adapted to the expression of various ideas afterwards (See Table S1.1).
It is one of the most ancient symbols, if not the oldest one, and Eastern Initiates confirm that it was concurrent with the circle of Divine Infinity and the first differentiation of Substance, blending of Spirit and Matter; in abstractiveness, disappears and becomes .

The vertical line being the male principle, and the horizontal the female, out of the union of the two at the intersection point is formed the CROSS; the oldest symbol in the Egyptian history of gods. It is the key of Heaven in the rosy fingers of Neith, the celestial virgin, who opens the gate at dawn for the exit of her first-begotten, the radiant sun. It is the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical cross of the high-grade Masons. We find this symbol ornamenting the tee of the umbrella-shaped oldest pagodas in Thibet, China, and India, as we find it in the hand of Isis, in the shape of the "handled cross" [3, V.2, P.270]. The philosophical cross, the two lines running in opposite directions, the horizontal and the perpendicular, the height and breadth, which the geometrizing Deity divides at the intersecting point, and which forms the magical as well as the scientific quaternary, when it is inscribed within the perfect square, is the basis of the occultist [2, V.2, P.556].
This way, the conjunction of the Heavenly vertical (Spirit) and the Earthy horizontal (Matter), or the masculine and feminine principles, in a point makes the Cross, or Stauros, presenting the potential of positive and negative, or masculine and feminine energies in Nature.



Crucifying the Earth on the Galactic Cross. Supplement 1 2
ASTRONOMICAL CROSS . The Circle and the Cross are indivisible; as the universal presentation, as old as the human wisdom, they are at the head of the long rows of, so to say, international symbols which frequently expressed great scientific truths, apart from psychological and even physiological secrets. In particular, they present the unity of Time (or "Wheel of Time") and Space.
The Secret Doctrine teaches us that everything in the universe, as well as the universe itself, is formed (created) during its periodical manifestations – by accelerated MOTION set into activity by the BREATH of the ever-to-be-unknown power (unknown to present mankind, at any rate) within the phenomenal world. The Spirit of Life and Immortality was everywhere symbolized by a circle: hence the serpent biting his tail, represents the circle of Wisdom in infinity {viz. cyclicity of TIME}; as does the astronomical cross – the cross within a circle, and the globe, with two wings added to it, which then became the sacred Scarabaeus of the Egyptians, its very name being suggestive of the secret idea attached to it. For the Scarabaeus is called in Egypt (in the papyri) Khopirron and Khopri from the verb Khopron "to become," and has thus been made a symbol and an emblem of human life and of the successive becomings of man, through the various peregrinations and metempsychoses (reincarnations) of the liberated Soul. This mystical symbol shows plainly that the Egyptians believed in reincarnation and the successive lives and existences of the Immortal entity. Being, however, an esoteric doctrine, revealed only during the mysteries by the priest-hierophants and the Kings-Initiates to the candidates, it was kept secret. The incorporeal intelligences (the Planetary Spirits, or Creative Powers) were always represented under the form of circles. In the primitive philosophy of the Hierophants these invisible circles were the prototypic causes and builders of all the heavenly orbs, which were their visible bodies or coverings, and of which they were the souls. It was certainly a universal teaching in antiquity. [2, V.2, P.552]
The Tau , and the astronomical cross of Egypt are conspicuous in several apertures of the remains of Palenque. In one of the basso-relievos of the Palace of Palenque, on the west side, sculptured as a hieroglyphic right under the seated figure, is a Tau. The standing figure, which leans over the first one, is in the act of covering its head with the left hand with the veil of initiation; while it extends its right with the index and middle finger pointing to heaven. The position is precisely that of a Christian bishop giving his blessing, or the one in which Jesus is often represented while at the Last Supper. . . . [2, V.2, P.557]. {From an astrological viewpoint this means that the astronomical cross describes the transfer of the upper-level influence onto the object of the lower-level}.
ANKH, OR CRUX ANSATA . The most sacred cross of Egypt that was carried in the hands of the gods,
the Pharaohs, and the mummied dead, is the Ankh the sign of life, the living, an oath, the covenant . . . The top of this is the hieroglyphic Ru set upright on the Tau-Cross. The Ru is the door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet. This denotes the birth-place in the northern quarter of the heavens, from which the Sun is reborn {from an astrological viewpoint this means that the 0° denotes the Origin of the Tropical year}. Hence the Ru of the Ankh sign is the feminine type of the birth-place, representing the north {Note, that the entrance of the Great Pyramid also looks towards the North}. It was in the NORTHERN QUARTER that the GODDESS OF THE SEVEN STARS, called the "Mother of the Revolutions," gave birth to time in the earliest cycle of the year {viz. on the Winter Solstice}. The first sign of this primordial circle and cycle made in heaven is the earliest shape of the Ankh-cross , a mere loop which contains both a circle and the cross in one image. This loop or noose is carried in front of the oldest genitrix, Typhon of the Great Bear, as her Ark, the ideograph of a period, an ending, a time, shown to mean one revolution [2, V.2, P.946] {hence, the Ankh, by itself, correlates the ATS [1, Parts 2, 3] with the TZ and with 0° as the start of a Tropical year}.
The Egyptian hierophant was given a square head-dress, which he had to wear always, and a square (see Mason's marks), without which he could never go abroad. The perfect Tau formed of the perpendicular (descending male ray, or spirit) a horizontal line (or matter, female ray), and the mundane circle was an attribute of Isis, and, it is but at his death that the Egyptian cross was laid on the breast of his mummy. [3, V.2, P.392]
As well, Crux ansata is frequently placed, instead of the central geometrical point which symbolises the invisible "Central Sun", in the dual triangle; being modified this way, this cross has almost the same meaning as the "Cross of the World" of the Egyptian Hermetics.



Crucifying the Earth on the Galactic Cross. Supplement 1 3
VENUS AND ANKH. A sphere over a cross, as a symbol of Venus, shows that it monitors origination of humanity. The Egyptians symbolised Ankh – "Life" – as the circle over Tau, ; this was another symbol for Venus (Isis) . Astronomically, Venus is presented as a sphere hovering over the cross , whereas the Earth – as a sphere with the cross above it . These crosses denote the Egyptian Сrux Ansata, an attribute of Isis (Who is Venus, as well as Aphrodite and Nature). The fact, that the Earth is presented by an upturned Сrux Ansata, is of great occult importance. Venus is the most occult, powerful and mysterious planet among the others; the influence it exerts to the Earth and its connection with our Planet are especially powerful. For this reason, these two are called "Twin-Sisters", though the Spirit of Earth is subject to "Lord" of Venus [1, V.2, Part I, Stance I]. Pythagoras named this Planet "another Sun".
Note S1.1. This concept emphasises the importance of Venus in the Mayan Cosmogenesis; the more so that the periods of these planets relate in the Golden Section [1, Part 3]. Some other concepts that stand beyond the Ankh are revealed in [1, Part 7]; in particular, it is shown in what way the Cross and Circle of the Ankh geometrically present the concept of Unity of Time and Space, and what part the Lemniscate plays in this model relative to the evolution. It is also shown that a close relation exists between the Ankh, Sarcophagus, King's Chamber and the Great Pyramid.
THE LABARUM [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labarum] and ANKH.
The labarum has become the symbol of Christianity and was introduced as such by the Roman emperor Constantine. The symbol itself is much older than Christianity. In Greek mythology the symbol represented the God Chronos, the keeper of time depicted in Greco-Roman mosaics as the turner of the Zodiacal Wheel. The Labarum consists of the first two letters of the Greek word Christ, Chi (χ) and Rho (P) and bears resemblance to the Egyptian Ankh symbol from which it was derived:
"...This then represents the circle made in the northern heaven by the Great Bear, which constituted the earliest year of time, from which we infer that the loop or Ru of the North represents that quarter, the birth-place of time when figured as the Ru of the Ankh symbol. Indeed this can be proved. The noose is an Ark or Rak type of reckoning. The Ru of the Ankh-cross was continued in the Cypriote R Ω and the Coptic Ro, P. The Ro, was carried into the Greek cross , which is formed of the Ro and Chi or R-K. . . . The Rak, or Ank, was the sign of all beginning (Arche) on this account, and the Ank-tie is the cross of the North, the hind part of Heaven. . . ." [2, V.2, P.547]
DOUBLE OR EIGHT-POINTED CROSS . Every nation which had an astronomical system, and especially India, held the cross in the highest reverence, for it was the geometrical basis of the religious symbolism of their avatars... The oldest monuments of Chaldea, Persia, and India disclose the double or eight-pointed cross. This symbol, which very naturally is found, like every other geometrical figure in nature, in plants as well as in the snowflakes, has led Dr. Lundy, in his super-Christian mysticism, to name such cruciform flowers as form an eight-pointed star by the junction of the two crosses -- "the Prophetic Star of the Incarnation, which joined heaven and earth, God and man together" ["Monumental Christianity," p. 3]. The latter sentence is perfectly expressed; only, the old kabalist axiom, "as above, so below," answers still better, as it discloses to us the same God for all humanity, not alone for the handful of Christians. It is the Mundane cross of Heaven repeated on earth ... The gesture of one hand pointing to Heaven, is balanced by the other pointing down to the earth; boundless generations below, boundless regenerations above; the visible but the manifestation of the invisible; ...[2, V.2, P.454].
Under the old system, we are told, Makara was the eighth instead of the tenth sign {viz. Capricorn}. It is "intended to represent the faces of the Universe, and indicates that the Universe is bounded by Pentagons," as the Sanskrit writers "speak also of Ashtadisa or eight faces bounding Space," referring thus to the loka-palas, the eight points of the compass (the four cardinal and the four intermediate points) . . . [2, V.2, P.577] "... Makaram may be taken to represent simultaneously both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as external objects of perception." [Subba Row. The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. pp. 113]. The Ogdoad or 8 symbolizes the eternal and spiral motion of cycles, the 8,  , and is symbolized in its turn by the Caduceus. It shows the regular breathing of the Kosmos ... [2, V.2, P.580].

Note S1.2. The above considerations present almost a direct indication to the existence of the "higher" level cross in addition to the Tropical one.
Note S1.3. Just for the reason that it is only the Tropical Zodiac which retains the association between the Capricorn and the birth of Sun, the Sidereal Zodiac cannot present the object for these considerations.
CROSS OF HENDAYE. The significance of the XX-correlation must have been well known in secret societies in Europe as well, since its secret is probably revealed in the Cross of Hendaye [10] – an enigmatic cross situated in the churchyard of a small village Hendaye (near St Jean de Luz and Biarritz) in the south of France. The Cross of Hendaye was discussed in an additional chapter of the 1957 reprint of the book ‘Le Mystère des Cathédrales’ (The Mystery of the Cathedrals) by Fulcanelli. The book revealed a lot of Gnostic ancient knowledge that was carefully preserved in a secret society that Fulcanelli was a member of. In his book Fulcanelli referred to the Cross of Hendaye as a ‘marker to the End of Time’. On top of the cross we find the inscription ‘O Crux Aves /Pes Unica’ (“Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope.”). On the other side of the cross the inscription INRI can be read which according to Fulcanelli stands for ‘Igne Natura Renovatur Integra’ ("By fire nature is renewed whole.").
Note S1.4. to this end, that the Theosophical sources [2] also state that the next world-wide catastrophe is to be associated with Fire, as the previous (viz. Atlantean) – with water.
"According to Fulcanelli and the cross at Hendaye, the alchemical Four Ages comprise the four quadrants of a 25,920 year long cycle called the precession of the equinoxes. ... The strange engraving of the four ‘A’s’ (see illustration A) on the cross of Hendaye is a "hieroglyph of the universe", according to Fulcanelli. It is "comprised of the conventional signs of heaven and earth, the spiritual and the temporal, the macrocosm and the microcosm, in which major emblems of the redemption (cross) and the world (circle) are found in association. ...
In addition to its profound restatement of the Western esoteric tradition, which is significant enough, perhaps the single most important aspect of Le Mystere was the single chapter added to the 1957 edition of the book. This chapter, called 'The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye,' discusses a simple yet mysterious monument located in south-western France that Fulcanelli dates to the middle of the seventeenth century." [11]
DECUSSATED CROSS  and SWASTICA . The four arms of the "", the decussated cross, and of the "Hermetic," pointing to the four cardinal points – were well understood by the mystical minds of the Hindus, Brahmins and Buddhists, thousands of years before it was heard of in Europe; and that symbol was and is found all over the world. They bent the ends of that cross and made of it their Swastica now the Wan of the Buddhist Mongolian (Footnote: The Swastica is certainly one of the oldest symbols of the Ancient Races) [2, V.2, P.556].
"TZ CROSS" . This form of the cross is given from [The J. of the Royal Asiatic Society, V.xviii., P.393, pl.4]: "At each of the four corners is placed a quarter arc of an oviform curve, and when the four are put together they form an oval; thus the figure combines the cross with the circle round in four parts, corresponding to the four corners of the cross. The four segments answer to the four feet of the Swastica cross and the Fylfot of Thor. The four-leaved lotus flower of Buddha, is likewise figured at the centre of this cross, the lotus being an Egyptian and Hindu type of the four quarters. The four quarter arcs, if joined together, would form an ellipse, and the ellipse is also figured on each arm of the cross. This ellipse therefore denotes the path of the earth {viz. the true form of the Earth's orbit}. . . .Sir J. Y. Simpson copied the fol
lowing specimen , which is here presented, as the cross of the two equinoxes and the two solstices placed within the figure of the earth's paths. The same ovoid or boat-shaped figure appears at times in the Hindu drawings with seven steps at each end as a form or a mode of Meru.
This is the astronomical aspect of the double glyph. There are six more aspects, however, and an attempt may be made to interpret a few of these. The subject is so vast that it would require in itself alone many volumes. ." [2, V.2, P.546].



Crucifying the Earth on the Galactic Cross. Supplement 1 5
Note S1.5. Just for the reason that it is only the Tropical Zodiac where the Solstices and Equinoxes retain their sense, the Sidereal Zodiac cannot present the object for these considerations.
S1.2. Tropical and Solar Zodiacs
TZ vs. SZ , or XX-Correlation as an Integral Model of the Earth-Sun-Space Interaction
Among other arts and sciences, the ancients -- ay, as a heirloom from the Atlanteans – had those of astronomy and symbolism, which included the knowledge of the Zodiac. As already explained, the whole of antiquity believed, with good reason, that humanity and its races are all intimately connected with the planets, and these with Zodiacal signs. The whole world's History is recorded in the latter. In the ancient temples of Egypt this was proved by the Dendera Zodiac [2, V.2, P.431].
In that very learned work, "The Natural Genesis," by Mr. Gerald Massey, on pp. 408-455 (Vol. I.), under the heading, "Typology of the Cross," there is more information to be had on the cross and circle than in any other work we know of. He who would fain have proofs of the antiquity of the Cross is referred to these two volumes. The author shows that "the circle and the cross are inseparable. . . . The crux ansata unites the circle and cross of the four corners. From this origin they came to be interchangeable at times. For example, the Chakra, or Disk of Vishnu, is a circle. The names denote the circling, wheeling round, periodicity, the wheel of time. This the god uses as a weapon to hurl at the enemy. In like manner, Thor throws his weapon, the Fylfot, a form of the four-footed cross (Swastica) and a type of the four quarters. Thus the cross is equivalent to the circle of the year. . . . The wheel emblem unites the cross and circle in one, as does the hieroglyphic cake and the Ankh-tie" [2, V.2, P.546].
Note S1.6. With respect to the above considerations and Notes 3, 5 it becomes evident now that (i) it is namely Tropical, not Sidereal, Zodiac that was considered in the ancient concepts, and (ii) a direct correlation exists between the Tropical Zodiac and the Cross, the different presentations of which reflect the appropriate aspects of the TZ.
Isarim, an Initiate, is said to have found at Hebron, on the dead body of Hermes, the well known Smaragdine tablet, which, it is said, contained the essence of Hermetic wisdom. . . .
"Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross . . . . Ascend from the earth to heaven and then descend again to earth"
was traced on it. The riddle of the cross is contained in these words, and its double mystery is solved -- to the Occultist [2, V.2, P.556].
{This Hermetic concept, together with the axiom "as above, so below; as below, so above" and Note 2 give almost direct indication to the existence of the Solar Zodiac and consistency of the XXCorrelation}.
Every one knows that  is the tenth sign of the Zodiac into which the Sun enters at the winter solstice, about December 21st. [2, V.2, P.576]. It presents the "Birth of the New Sun." {this gives one more acknowledge to the Note 3}.
But very few are those who know – even in India, unless they are initiated – the real mystic connection which seems to exist, as we are told, between the names Makara and Kumara. The first means some amphibious animal called flippantly 'crocodile,' as some Orientalists think, and the second is the title of the great patrons of Yogins (See "Saiva Puranas,") the Sons of, and even one with, Rudra (Siva); a Kumara himself. It is through their connection with Man that the Kumaras are likewise connected with the Zodiac [1, V.2, P.576]. {Galactic Centre?}
But the true esoteric sense of the word "Makara," does not mean "crocodile," in truth, at all, even when it is compared with the animal depicted on the Hindu Zodiac. ... As Mr. T. Subba Row truly declares, "The veil, that was dexterously thrown over certain portions of the mystery connected with the (Zodiacal)



Crucifying the Earth on the Galactic Cross. Supplement 1 6
signs by the ancient philosophers, will never be fully lifted up for the amusement or edification of the uninitiated public." [2, V.2, P.580]
In India and Egypt these Dhyanis were connected with the Crocodile, and their abode is in Capricornus. These are convertible terms in Indian astrology, as this (tenth) sign of the Zodiac is called Makara, loosely translated "crocodile." The word itself is occultly interpreted in various ways ...[2, V.1, P.219]
One of the explanations of the real though hidden meaning of this Egyptian religious glyph is easy. The crocodile is the first to await and meet the devouring fires of the morning sun, and very soon came to personify the solar heat. When the sun arose, it was like the arrival on earth and among men "of the divine soul which informs the Gods." Hence the strange symbolism. The mummy donned the head of a crocodile to show that it was a soul arriving from the earth.
The crocodile is the Egyptian dragon. It was the DUAL SYMBOL of HEAVEN and EARTH; ... the Egyptians represented the sun in a ship as its pilot, this ship being carried along by a crocodile "to show the MOTION OF THE SUN in the moyst (SPACE)". Moreover, it was the symbol of Egypt [2, V.1, P.409].
Note S1.7. It’s remarkable that the Maya called the dark rift in the Milky Way to which the 2012 Winter Solstice Sun will align the ‘Mouth of the Crocodile’ or the ‘Jaguar Toad’. This then may be no coincidence! Both Vedic and Maya cosmology may be referring to the same event using the same symbol of the crocodile to define the GCC. According to Jenkins the Maya defined this point as the moment that the Sun enters the mouth of the Crocodile (dark rift in the Milky Way), while in Vedic astrology this moment is connected with the alignment of sign MAKARA (Capricorn) with the Winter Solstice. (See also www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/1.htm and www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/jmj.htm).
Note S1.8. And what of the Solar deity emerging from the toad-jaguar's mouth? The outstretched hands on Stela 11 represent completion or measurement-a typical period-ending concept. In the Popol Vuh, First Father measured the cosmos at the beginning of time. On Stela 11 we see a frog or toad (the Milky Way) birthing the solar First Father deity. In the calendar, the frog or toad glyph stands for the 20-day uinal period of the Long Count. As such, it represents time-period completion (and commencement). In Maya hieroglyphs, when the frog's mouth is upright and open, the meaning is "to be born" and "date initiation." This identification is basic and very important, and confirms that Stela 11 represents the alignment of the December solstice sun with the dark-rift in the Milky Way which occurs on the 13-baktun cycle end-date in 2012 AD. Furthermore, given the "to be born" meaning of the upturned frog's mouth, the way the future alignment was thought of in Izapan/Maya Creation myth involved the solar First Father hero being reborn, or emerging from, the dark-rift portal to the Otherworld, which was symbolized by the mouth of a snake, caiman or frog (the Milky Way itself being the snake or frog or caiman).
Osiris is called in the "Book of the Dead" "Osiris, the double Crocodile." (See Chapter "On the Names of Osiris," cxlii.) "He is the good and the bad Principle; the Day, and the Night Sun, the God, and the mortal man." Thus far the Macrocosm and the Microcosm [2, V.2, P.580].
For the Lotus and Water are among the oldest symbols, and in their origin are purely Aryan, though they became common property during the branching-off of the fifth race. Let us give an example. Letters, as much as numbers, were all mystic, whether in combination or each taken separately. The most sacred of all is the letter M. It is both feminine and masculine, or androgyne, and is made to symbolize WATER, the great deep, in its origin {viz. the Space}. It is mystic in all the languages, Eastern and Western, and
stands as a glyph for the waves, {viz. the Space waves } thus: . In the Aryan Esotericism, as in the Semitic, this letter has always stood for the waters; e.g., in Sanskrit MAKARA – the tenth sign of the Zodiac -- means a crocodile, or rather an aquatic monster associated always with water. [2, V.1, P.384]
Ashtadisa or eight faces bounding Space," referring thus to the loka-palas, the eight points of the compass (the four cardinal and the four intermediate points) . . . Makaram may be taken to represent SIMULTANEOUSLY both the MICROCOSM and the MACROCOSM, as external objects of perception" [2, V.2, P.577].

S1.3. GCC-Transformation
{According to many ancient traditions the precession maps history into world Ages that are associated with the signs of Zodiac. The Maya’s, Egyptian and Vedic cultures all explain that humanity has gone through alternating Ages of spiritual darkness and enlightenment. But what can we meet at the "edge" of the ages? The Hermetic axiom allows us to propagate the below description to the GCC.}
CRUCIFIXION. Stauros, or Tau, becomes a "tool" for execution "under" the Sun much later.
... the spirit of it has been ever misunderstood. "To cru cify before (not against) the sun" is a phrase used of initiation. It comes from Egypt, and primarily from India. The enigma can be unriddled only by searching for its key in the Mysteries of Initiation. The initiated adept, who had successfully passed through all the trials, was attached, not nailed, but simply tied on a couch in the form of a tau (in Egypt) or a Svastika without the four additional prolongations (thus: , not ) plunged in a deep sleep (the "Sleep of Siloam" it is called to this day among the Initiates in Asia Minor, in Syria, and even higher Egypt). He was allowed to remain in this state for three days and three nights, during which time his Spiritual Ego was said to confabulate with the "gods," descend into Hades, Amenti, or Patala, (according to the country), and do works of charity to the invisible beings, whether souls of men or Elemental Spirits; his body remaining all the time in a temple crypt or subterranean cave. In Egypt it was placed in the Sarcophagus in the King's Chamber of the Pyramid of Cheops, and carried during the night of the approaching third day to the entrance of a gallery {Northern side of the Great Pyramid}, where at a certain hour the beams of the rising Sun struck full on the face of the entranced candidate, who awoke to be initiated by Osiris, and Thoth the God of Wisdom [1, V.2, P.558].
Note S1.9. The direct analogy between the GCC and initiation is seen in the following passage.
Let the reader ... turn to some most suggestive Egyptian bas reliefs. One especially from the temple of Philoe, represents a scene of initiation. Two Gods-Hierophants, one with the head of a hawk (the Sun), the other ibis-headed (Mercury, Thoth, the god of Wisdom and secret learning, the assessor of OsirisSun), are standing over the body of a candidate just initiated. They are in the act of pouring on his head a double stream of water (the water of life and new birth), which stream is interlaced in the shape of a cross and full of small ansated crosses. This is allegorical of the awakening of the candidate (now an Initiate), when the beams of the morning sun (Osiris) strike the crown of his head (his entranced body being placed on its wooden Tau so as to receive the rays). Then appeared the Hierophants-Initiators, and the sacramental words were pronounced, ostensibly, to the Sun-Osiris, addressed in reality to the Spirit Sun within, enlightening the newly-born man [1, V.2, P.559].
Let the reader meditate on the connection of the Sun with the Cross in both its generative and spiritually regenerative capacities -- from the highest antiquity. ... In this extraordinary sculpture and painting one sees the disc of the Sun beaming upon an ansated cross placed upon a cross of which those of the Calvary were perfect copies. The ancient MSS. mention these as the "hard couches of those who were in (spiritual) travail, the act of giving birth to themselves." A quantity of such cruciform "couches," on which the candidate, thrown into a dead trance at the end of his supreme initiation, was placed and secured, were found in the underground halls of the Egyptian temples after their destruction. The worthy and holy Fathers of the Cyril and Theophilus types used them freely, believing they had been brought and concealed there by some new converts. Alone Origen, and after him Clemens Alexandrinus and other exinitiates, knew better. But they preferred to keep silent [2, V. 2, P.559].



Crucifying the Earth on the Galactic Cross. Supplement 2 1
SUPPLEMENT 2. ESTIMATING THE EPOCHS OF THE GCC AND GA
S2.1. SOLAR SYSTEM AND GALACTIC PARAMETERS
Coordinate Systems. In the Equatorial and Ecliptical coordinate systems [4] the same Origin of longitudes is used which coincides with the Vernal point , or 0°. Due to the precession of the Equinoxes this point moves along the circle of Ecliptic at a speed of approximately

vP 50 sec of arc a year
26000yr
360 60 60'
26000yr
360 

=
 . (S2.1)
That is why these coordinates of the remote Celestial objects change significantly in time. At this, as the proper velocities of stars are much lesser than vP , at a short time span they retain their Ecliptical latitudes
with an insignificant error, though their longitudes (due to precession) grow, in average, at a speed vP .
For this reason the epoch must be provided for any coordinate for specifying the moment of time for which the position of the object is given. As a rule, the coordinates of the basic objects are defined in the Equatorial system for the standard epoch of J2000.0 (formerly – for J1950). Thus in order to obtain the Equatorial coordinates for the specified moment we interpolate them with the use of the coordinates at the standard epochs. In order to obtain the Ecliptic coordinates of an object, we transform its standard Equatorial coordinates to the desired epoch and, then, convert them into Ecliptic ones with taking account of variation in the Obliquity. Here, we consider average coordinates, without correction for nutation.
Obliquity. For this quantity, a linear interpolation is used with the following reference values [11]
(J1950) = 23.4457889°, or 23° 26' 44.840''; (S2.2)
(J2000) = 23.4392911°, or 23° 26' 21.448''. (S2.3)
Note S2.1. Making use of this high-precision interpolation instead of the average values has shifted the point estimate of the epoch of the Great Celestial Conjunction by a year – from March 1999 to May 1998 (S2.7). This clearly illustrates a significant instability of the problem of estimating the "exact" date for the slow motions which are influenced by a series of perturbations.
Resume S2.1. From a viewpoint of long-termed historical predictions this instability leaves us the least hope for the coincidence of the predicted and actual epochs, even if the prediction was true in its essence.
Point Estimates of the Galactic Parameters. The Solar System revolves around the Galactic Centre (GC) almost exactly within the Galactic plane (Fig. 5): the Sun is only 10 pc (up to 34 pc, relative to other estimates) distant from this plane, though it is 10 000 pc (5 000 pc) distant from the GC (Conventional bound of the Galaxy, resp.). Hence, the angle  , the Sun makes to the Galactic Plane relative to the GC,
fits the equation tg ( ) = 10 (pc)/ 10 000 (pc) = 0.001, viz. it makes approximately 3arc (viz. up to 11').
As far as the Nucleus is hidden with nebulae, the spatial star density decreases continually, and there exists no sharp bound in distribution of stars, the exact dimension of the Galaxy could not be defined, neither the true coordinates of the North Pole of the Galaxy and GC.
Due to this uncertainty in the Galactic parameters and Obliquity we must remember that the accepted point estimates for these values (Tables S2.1 – S2.3) specify them, but with some error. In this sense we cannot rely upon the point estimate, but if it is supplemented with an interval estimate that allows for this uncertainty, we can make our conclusions much more adequate. Besides, as far as every process develops during some period of time, the interval estimates allow us to evaluate the duration of the process.
Resume S2.2. By allowing for the degree of uncertainty of the considered parameters in the interval estimates we may neglect both the angular discrepancy between the GC and Galactic Plane, and the error in the coordinate of the Galactic North Pole and take the Galactic Plane for the Solar System’s Ecliptic ES .

S2.2. INTERVAL ESTIMATES FOR THE GALACTIC ALIGNMENT
Interval of uncertainty. The considered uncertainty in the position of the North Pole of the Galactic Plane, G
NP , is estimated by some astronomers by a value of up to a tenth of a degree. With respect to the
precession (S2.1) this angular error of 6' corresponds to uncertainty in  7.2 yr; this yields the following interval estimate for the epoch of GCC
GCC*  J1998.3  7.2 yr  {1991.1, 2005.5}. (S2.17)
But this estimate does not reflect the physical and esoterical significance of the Sun in this process of transferring (or amplifying) of the outer energies to within the Solar System. Thus in astrology only those extra-Solar-System objects are considered effectual which conjunct the Sun and cardinal points of the chart; planets are less significant in this sense.
Precession over the Solar disk. An efficient approach for obtaining an interval estimate for a similar event – Galactic Alignment (GA) – was proposed in [8]. It consists in estimating the precession of the Galactic Equator over the Winter Solstice Solar disc. In essence, a general validity of this approach rests on the same grounds that were put forward relative to the concept of the Solar Zodiac [1, Part 8].
The Solstice Sun is the moment when the Sun coincides with the Winter Solstice cardinal point 0° (WS); this event takes place when the Sun's coordinate makes exactly =180° 0' 0'' in Ecliptic longitude, or =18h 0m 0s (viz. 180° 0' 0'') in R.A. But this relates to the center of the Sun; the visible angular diameter of the Sun makes a significant value of 31' 31.34'' (at aphelion) to 32' 35.78'' (at perihelion, near the Winter Solstice).
Let S
 be half a diameter of the Solar disc. Then the Sun starts to cover the WS after its centre approach
es the place being S
 distant from this cardinal point (Fig. S2.1.a) until the transiting Sun's centre be
comes S
 distant from the WS. By interpolating the above Sun's diameters for the Solstice (as it is about
two weeks distant from the aphelion) we get
S
 = (32' 30.84'')/2 = 16' 15.42''. (S2.18)
Interval estimate for the GA. The Galactic Equator intersects the Solstice Sun disk after getting in touch with it (Fig. S2.1.b); after then, the point VE (the "Vernal Equinox" of the Solar Zodiac – the intersection of the Ecliptic and Galactic Equator) continues to precess towards the WS until the Great Celestial Conjunction, and further on – till the point C'.
Fig S2.1. Obtaining an interval estimate for the GA
As far as the Galactic Equator is inclined to the Ecliptic at an angle  BCA which makes approximately 60°, the length of the segment CA makes S

But this value should not be simply substituted in (S2.17) instead of 7.2 years!
With respect to the definition (4), the Galactic Alignment is a discrete event that allows just for the Winter Solstice. Hence, both for this event itself, and for its interval bounds we should consider the Solstices. Therefore, - for the point estimate of the Galactic Alignment we must take neither the year 1998 [8], nor the WS of 1998, but the Winter Solstice being the closest to the epoch (S2.7), that is
P
GA = { December 21, 1997; GMT 20:07}; (S2.20)
- for the interval estimate of the Galactic Alignment (viz. the Galactic Alignment "zone", or "era-2012.") we therefore must use neither the interval 1998 +/- 18 years (viz. 1980 – 2016) [8], nor the year of 1998, but those Winter Solstices which fit the interval P
GCC +/- 22.5 years, that is
I
GA = { ( Dec. 22, 1975; GMT 11:46 ) , ( Dec. 22, 2019; GMT 4:21) }. (S2.21)
Hence, the relations (S2.20), (S2.21) define the corrected, with respect to the definition of the GA, point and interval estimates (6) for the Galactic Alignment.
S2.3.INTERVAL ESTIMATES FOR THE EPOCH OF THE GREAT CELESTIAL CONJUNCTION
Meanwhile, with respect to the Great Celestial Conjunction the idea of precession of the Galactic Equator over the Solar disc deserves further analysis, but under the following natural conditions.
C1. As far as we are concerned with the Celestial events on the Ecliptic, an adequate model must deal with the points on it as well. The most important elements of the SZ are presented on the Ecliptic by its cardinal points; at this, the Ecliptic longitude of any SZ's cardinal point (e.g. VE) defines the positions of the remaining ones to within a summand of k 90 (k=1, 2, 3).
C2. By considering the Solar disc as a lens that focuses the Solar and Galactic energies being emanated from the adjacent cardinal points of TZ and SZ into the unitary Earth-directed flow at the Winter Solstice, we can apply the same approach to the opposite Solstice, as well as to the TZ's Equinoxes for the similar situations in which the transiting Sun covers the respective pairs of the cardinal points of the Tropical and Solar Zodiacs.
C3. As far as we are allowing for the diameter of the transiting Sun, and the consideration of the cardinal points of both Zodiacs does not require us to give dominance to one of them, we are not generally conditioned to an analysis of the exact conjunction of the centre of the transiting Sun with a cardinal point of TZ. Meanwhile, taking into account of the visible Solar diameter allows us to evaluate the efficacy of these conjunctions like a significance of a total Solar eclipse may be estimated by a duration of black-out.
Basic precessional period. Find firstly an interval estimates for the epoch (S2.7) with respect to condition C1 provided that the Solar disk centre is exactly at a cardinal point of TZ. As far as the precession of the point VE over the Solstice Solar disk starts with the position in which it firstly gets in touch with the disc (Fig. S2.2), it reaches the TZ's Cardinal Point WS in the basic precessional period

Era of GCC. Though the "exact" GCC has occured in 1998, its actual influence is to be distributed over the preceding and subsequent 19.5-year time intervals; this gives the estimate of the Era of GCC

Note S2.3. As the estimate (S2.17) allows just for an uncertainty in the Galactic North Pole coordinate, so the estimate (S2. 23) takes into account the physical peculiarities of the Solar disc "lens" (viz. C2).

Note S2.4. In particular, if the definition of the GA is corrected so that the VE point is taken instead of the tangent BC, for the GA the interval estimate (S2. 21) may thus be improved as follows
S
GA = { (Dec. 22, 1978), (Dec. 21, 2016) }. (S2.24)
Age of GCC Transformations. Find now an interval estimates for the epoch (S2.7) with respect to C3. The Solar disc starts to cover the cardinal points VE of SZ and WS of TZ concurrently after the former approaches the latter at a distance of 2 S

the Solar disk covers the respective pairs of the TZ and SZ cardinal points simultaneously. This interval is the largest one where the Solar disc covering the cardinal points of both Zodiacs still works as a concentrator of the Space and Solar influence; for this reason call it the Age of GCC Transformations.

Note S2.5. The iterative covering of the pairs of cardinal points of the Tropical and Solar Zodiacs (e.g. WS and VE) by the Solar disc as specified in C2 can be likened to the actual situation with a solar eclipse: although this is the unique astronomical moment when the Sun, Moon, and Earth centres come to the "exact" alignment, the Eclipse spot moves over the surface of Earth for hours. The difference is that the Solar disc "lens" works as a "force-pump": the Sun covers these pairs of cardinal points four times a year, and each time with an increased duration until the "exact" epoch of the GCC (May 7, 1998) when the Galactic Equator, Ecliptic, and Solstice Meridian of Ecliptic intersect at the cardinal points 0°  and 0°  (central position of the Galactic Equator in Fig. S2.3). 39 years before the GCC, the transiting Sun starts to cover both cardinal points, (0° ) of the TZ and (the "vernal" Equinox of the SZ), concurrently (right position of the Galactic Equator in Fig. S2.3); 39 years after the GCC, the transiting Sun stops to cover both these cardinal points concurrently (left position of the Galactic Equator in Fig. S2.3). The same holds true for the remaining pairs of the cardinal points (Fig. S2.4).

Reiteration of the GCCs. Due to the orthogonality of the zodiac axes the Age of GCC Transformations repeats four times a Platonic year, but each time the correspondence between the cardinal points of the TZ and SZ changes with respect to Fig. 7: next time (viz. in 6500 years) the Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox of the TZ will coincide with the same Equinoxes of the SZ, whereas the TZ's Winter Solstice – with the SZ's Summer Solstice, and vice versa.
Note S2.5. The dominance of the TZ's WS point over the Summer Solstice might be explained by the closeness of the Galactic Centre and Solar Apex. Meanwhile, alignment of all these four points along the Solstice line may probably show its dominance over the Equinox axis. On the other hand, the axis of Equinoxes is aligned with the Axis of the Galaxy. So, we may conclude that at the current GCC (when the VE of the SZ coincides with the WS of the TZ) the TZ's WS is the most significant one, whereas the actuality of the remaining TZ's cardinal points, in a decreasing order, is as follows: SS, and Equinoxes.
The interval of culmination of the GCC. At the Winter (Summer) Solstice the Sun moves along the Ecliptic approximately at a speed of 61' (57') a day. Then, at every Winter (Summer) Solstice the Solar disc covers the point 0° (0°) for a period of

in average, with an insignificant error of 0.2%. The VE of the SZ is also covered every year by the Solar disc during the same average period, but 39 years before (or after) the "exact" moment of the GCC (the extreme positions of the Galactic Equator in Fig. S2.3) these two events start to take place concurrently, but for an instant. Year by year, while the point VE approaches the WS, the period of concurrent covering of these two points by the Sun grows till the value of tW (the central position of the Galactic
Equator in Fig. S2.3); after then, the process develops in the inverse order. The same process develops with other pairs of cardinal points (e.g. SS and AE). Note that this process may also be likened to the development of the Solar eclipse: the closer we get to the epoch of the "exact" correlation, the longer the Sun accepts the Galactic influence through the VE point of the Solar System Zodiac and retransmits it, together with its own Solstice effect, further on – to the Earth, through the cardinal point WS of the TZ. For this reason the Solstices may have especial influence for the Terrestrial life at present.
