lugal 2) urim5-ki-ma. It translates as: 1) tomb royal 2) ur :
Royal Tombs of Ur.
The artifacts from the Royal Tombs of Ur give us a complete picture of
ancient Sumerian art and civilization. With the notable exception of the
Egyptian tomb of Tutankhamen, no other archaeological discovery gives
us a better understanding of ancient life and culture. In fact,
it would be difficult to visualize Sumerian history without the artifacts
from the Tombs of Ur. Pictures of these artifacts are displayed throughout
these pages. They are also seen on other websites, all across
the Internet. Most of these websites contain only a few pictures, usually
the same ones, with little variety between them.
Most of the artifacts are stored in the British Museum and the Penn
Museum. Some of them are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The
problem is, it takes some "digging" to find the treasures of the Royal
Tombs of Ur in the museum websites, which contain vast quantities of
artifacts from all over the world. Even so, you can only see one picture at a
time; and while
you are on one museum website you cannot see the artifacts in the other
museums. You can never see the collection in its entirety, all at once, to get
the full effect.
The purpose of these pages is to provide a more comprehensive view of the
treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur. It's an on-going project and it is by
no means complete. I intend to add more pictures as they become
available.
Many thanks to the British Museum, the Penn Museum, the Met, and
other contributors,
for making the pictures of the artifacts available online.

Ur was the so-called 'Royal Cemetery', which he began to excavate in 1926.
Work on the site would continue for the next twelve years (no further
excavations have been done at the site since then). He would later be
knighted for his work in the field of archaeology.
There is a complete story of the excavations on the website of the
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

The16 Tombs of Ur that Woolley considered to be "royal". PG 755 is only
partially shown
because it is buried beneath PG 779. "PG" means private grave.
The cemetary was originally dug outside the walls of the city of
Ur, and were built over by the walls of Nebuchadnezzar's larger city about
2,000 years later. Some 1,840 burials were found, dating to between 2600
BC and 2000 BC. They ranged from simple burials (with a body rolled
in a mat) to elaborate burials in domed tombs reached by descending
ramps. Sixteen of the early burials Woolley called 'Royal Graves' because

of the rich grave-goods, the presence of burial chambers, and the bodies
of the attendants who had apparently been sacrificed.
The Great Death Pit: PG1237, with its 74 attendants, was the most
spectacular of Ur’s royal tombs. Woolley called any burial without a tomb
chamber a "death pit”. He named PG1237 “The Great Death Pit" because
of the many bodies that were found within it. Enlarge.
PG1237 included 6 men and 68 women. The men, near the tomb’s
entrance, had weapons
so they could guard the tomb against grave-robbers. Most of the women
were in four rows across the northwest corner of the death pit. The women
were dressed in scarlet. They wore ornamental headdresses and were
adorned with jewelry of silver and gold, lapis lazuli and carnelian. Six
women lay near two lyres and a harp, near the southeast wall. Most of the
women had cups or shells containing cosmetic pigments. Body 61, in the
upper right corner, was more elaborately attired than the others and
she had a silver tumbler next to her mouth.

Half of the women (but none of the men) had cups or jars, as if at a
banquet.
One of the women was found still clucthing a coiled ribbon for her
headband, as if she had been late for the ceremonies and was too hurried
(or frightened) to put it on.
Perhaps the attendants voluntarily took poison and were buried while
unconscious or dead.
The neat arrangement of bodies convinced Woolley the attendants in the
tombs had not been killed, but had willingly gone to their deaths. He
suggested that in so doing they were assured "a less nebulous and
miserable existence” than ordinary men and women. The soldiers had
weapons of gold and silver and the insignia of their rank. The women had
golden headdresses and were heavily bejeweled. In life they would have
looked like royalty, but the soldiers were commoners and the women were
servants. In sacrificing themselves, they were hoping for a better life for all
eternity.
A sudy was recently done at the UPenn Museum on the skulls of a woman
and a soldier. Both skulls show signs of premortem fractures that were
caused by a blunt instrument.
This was deemed to be the cause of death, not poisoning. The two theories,
death by poison and death by blunt force trauma, are not incompatible. It
suggests that the participants whose dosage of poison had not proved to
be fatal were given a coup de grâce to spare them prolonged suffering
and to insure they wouldn't be buried while still alive and conscious.
Another possibility is the attendants drank a strong sedative, rather than
poison, and then were clubbed to death after they were unconscious. This,
however, seems to be a
needlessly crude and messy alternative, and not befitting the dignity of the
occasion.

It would also mean the injury would be evident on all of the skulls. It
remains for further
scientific testing to prove the exact manner of death for the majority of the
participants.
I suggest the attendants drank a sedative and then they were
strangled/suffocated
so their bodies would not appear mutilated in the afterlife.
What's notable about this burial is that it lacks the body of its principal
occupant, such as the
body of a king or a queen. It has recently been suggested that Body 61 is
actually a queen, like Queen Pu-abi (see below) because she is more
elaborately attired than the others.
I don't agree with this theory: She wasn't buried with her cylinder seals
like Queen Pu-abi;
she doesn't have her own personal possessions, and she doesn't lie on a
funeral bier
in her own burial chamber. Her body lies in the jumble of other bodies,
with nothing except
her fine jewelry to show she has greater status than the other women. By
the same token,
she could just as easily be a favored concubine.
The details of the drawing are best seen with enlargement. In the picture,
you can see two bull‐headed lyres and a "boat lyre", the two "rams in the
thicket" (pictured below), Body 61, the headdresses worn by the women,
and the small cups that they are holding.

Burial at the Royal Tombs of Ur: The attendants were arranged as
shown, then they were given poison to drink. The oxen were also killed.
The structure in the background is the domed burial chamber. The female
attendants with their elaborate headdresses are lined up
in front of the burial chamber. The men on the left are the soldiers who
will guard the tomb
for all eternity.
When the picture is enlarged, one can see many of the artifacts displayed
on these pages. Included are: the weapons of the soldiers, the ringed reign
posts between the oxen, and the two bull-headed lyres.

The floor plan of The King's Grave (PG 789). As can be seen in the
drawing, the burial chamber had been plundered in antiquity, but the
death pit was completely undistrubed. The silver boat model found beside
the door of the burial chamber is one of the few items that wasn't taken. It
can be seen in the Miscellaneous section.
The Great Lyre is seen leaning against the wall with the row of the female
attendants. Another large lyre, now in the British Museum, leans against
the lefthand wall.
Although designed for younger audiences, Mesopotamia.co, by the
British Museum, has an interesting feature that allows you to drag the

The Standard of Ur:

Perhaps the most iconic artifact from the Royal Tombs is the Standard of
Ur. It was found in one of the larger gravesites (PG 779) next to the body
of a soldier. Leonard Woolley called it a standard because he thought it
was carried aloft on a pole during processions of the king. A more recent
theory is that it's a sound box for a musical instrument. Another theory is
that the standard is a "cash box" used to store funds for warfare or
civic and religious projects (for its true purpose, see The Standard of Ur?).
The standard is made of shell, red limestone
and lapis lazuli overlaid on wood. The dark lines that add detail to the
shell figures were inscribed with a hot needle. The Standard of Ur is 21.59
cm high and 49.53 cm long (8.5 x 19.6 inches). The front panel is called
War and the back panel is called Peace.

abundance of the Land − sheep, bulls, goats, etc., in thanksgiving to the
god of victory and their king. They are led by a man with his hands folded
in prayer (top right). The bulls are led by ropes threaded through
their nose rings. The bulls (and the goat) wear aprons. They are
"garlanded for sacrifice", which will be performed during the opening
ceremonies. The horses shown in the scene below wear the same
apron. The other animals will be eaten during the victory feast. The man
second from the right (bottom row) carries some freshly caught fish.
The procession continues with scenes of the defeated enemy,
distinguishable by their "angled-skirts", carrying tribute in bags and in
backpacks to the victorious Sumerian king.

Notice how the king is drawn larger than the others to indicate his greater
importance. The noblemen are drawn the second-largest, while the
commoners (servants and musicians) are drawn the smallest to reflect
their lowly status (even while standing they are no taller than
the seated noblemen). This artistic convention was used throughout the
ancient world. The servant on the right has his left hand tucked inside his
right armpit, which is the ritualized gesture of obedience. The king holds
something in his left hand, perhaps a royal scepter:
A king's royal sceptre. This scepter was found in the largest of the
royal tombs (PG 1236). The end caps are mushroom-shaped shells, inlaid
with red and blue rosettes. There are five bands of thin gold foil that have
designs in bas-relief, as if they were cylinder seals, but they are no longer
recognizable. The gold bands are separated with rings of lapis lazuli. The
other bands are mosaics of shell and lapis lazuli triangles, separated by
rings of shell and red limestone. It is 41.5 centimeters in length (16.33
inches).
The Lion of Ur: Made of silver,
it was probably used as a finial for the arm of a chair. His eyes are made of
shell and lapis lazuli.

The Ram in the Thicket: Two of these sculptures were found by
Leonard Woolley in the Great Death Pit. He named it "The Ram in a
Thicket". It is an allusion to the biblical story of Abraham, when God
offered a ram caught in a thicket as a substitution for Abraham's
intended sacrifice of his son Isaac. It depicts a ram (or more accurately, a
goat) rearing up on his hind legs to eat the leaves on the high branches of a
tree (this is also depicted on the shell plaque pictured below). The
branches are tipped with buds and eight-pointed rosettes. The statue is
made of gold leaf, copper, shell, and lapis lazuli, and it's supported on a
small rectangular base decorated with a mosaic of shell, red limestone and
lapis lazuli. The tube above the goat's shoulders was likely used to hold
a small tray or offering bowl. This kind
of statue was sometimes used to support a table, as shown on a cylinder
seal drawing by S. Beaulieu. The statue is 45.7 centimeters high (18
inches).

Queen Pu-abi: Most of the spectacular treasures from The Royal Tombs
of Ur came from her burial chamber, which hadn't already been looted by
grave robbers. Queen Pu-abi was less than five feet tall, and she was about
40 years old when she died. Her headdress is supported by a large
wig. The headdress was reconstructed by Leonard Woolley's wife,
Katherine. The face was modeled on the features of a local woman living
near where the tombs were discovered.
There has been a lot of speculation on whether Pu-abi was actually a
queen. She is
referred to as nin, which means "Lady, a noblewoman" or eresh, which
means "queen".
There is also some speculation that she may have been a high priestess,
since only women
of the high nobility were appointed to this exalted position. What's known
for certain is that she was clearly a woman of high status, given the wealth
and abundance of her grave goods and the number of men and women
who were sacrificed to serve her in the afterlife.
To find out more on this subject, see Pu-abi, the Queen?.

The tomb chamber containing Pu-abi’s body and two of her attendants is
seen at the top of the drawing. The death pit, with a wooden chest, chariot,
oxen, and more attendants, is shown at the bottom. Puabi's tomb didn't
have a door, which means her body was placed there before the roof was
constructed and the tomb was sealed. The details of the tomb are best seen
when the picture is enlarged.
Queen Pu-abi lay on a wooden bier, a gold cup near at hand. She wore an
elaborate headdress, and the upper part of her body was entirely hidden
by multi-colored beads. She was surrounded with her personal
possessions, the richest found in any Sumerian tomb. Buried with her
were the bodies of 26 attendants, men and women, and a team of oxen
harnessed to a decorated processional chariot.

section. This woman was found in the Great Death Pit. See a photograph

Queen Pu-abi's cylinder seals: She was found with three cylinder
seals which were pinned to her cloak. The cylinder seals are made of lapis
lazuli.
The first seal impression depicts a banquet, with the royals feasting and
drinking while being attended by servants (notice how the servants are
drawn smaller than the royal personages). The table is piled high with
food and drink. Pu-abi's name is in the lefthand corner. The sign on the far
left is nin/eresh, meaning "lady" or "queen". See a different, enlarged
image of the seal.
The second seal impression also shows a royal banquet. The middle of of
the top panel shows a man and a woman (Pu-abi herself) drinking from a
vat of beer using long straws. The straws were used to avoid the foul
tasting foam on top of Sumerian beer and the dregs on the bottom.
Other people are shown feasting and drinking wine. Enlarge.

The Royal Game of Ur: The board is made of wood, with inlays of
shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli. It has twenty squares. The inside of
the board is hollow, and is used for the storage of the game pieces. The
game is considered to be a predecessor to the modern game
of backgammon. Many examples of this game have been found throughout
the ancient Near East. It’s a two-player game. At the beginning of the
game, a player’s pieces were allowed onto the board only with specific
throws of the dice. The players then competed to race their pieces across
the board. Five of the squares have flower rosettes. The rosette squares
were considered to be lucky. The rosette motif occurs frequently in
Sumerian art, and is thought to have some kind of symbolic significance.
It occurs on the royal sceptre seen above, and on many of the items seen in
the Vessels and Jewelry sections. This game was found in the
tomb of Queen Pu-abi. A similar version of the game was found in PG 789,

Game dice. The dice for the Royal Game of Ur wasn't found, but perhaps
this is the kind of dice that was used.
Food and drink were also provided:
Pu-abi's gold cup. The handle is actually a hollow spout. It was used like
a straw to avoid the unsavory foam on top of the beer and the dregs on the
bottom.

The Great Lyre: found in the King's Grave. The head, face and horns are
gold foil wrapped over a wooden form. The hair and beard are lapis lazuli,
as are the eyes, inlaid into shell. The front panel is shell inlaid in
bitumen. This image has been photographically enhanced to
improve the color quality and to give an idea of how the lyre looked when
it was new.

Leonard Woolley holding one of several lyres discovered in the Royal
Tombs of Ur.
Two lyres and a harp, in situ, as they were found in the "Great
Death Pit". The lyre on the left is the Silver Lyre. In the middle is
the Royal Harp, and on the right is the Golden Lyre, all of which
are pictured below. The wood of the lyres had long ago decayed, but the
forms of the lyres had been preserved by the silver sheeting and the shell
inlays.
In the lower righthand corner is the remains of a female musician that has
been reduced to a pile of jewelry, of which the ear pendants are the most
prominent.

Three quarter view of the Golden Lyre.
A man plays a bull-headed lyre at the banquet of a king. The lyre is
supported by a strap across his shoulder. The "woman" is a singer. There's
been some debate as to whether or not she is actually a woman because
she appears topless, though it seems that a topless woman would not be
entirely out of place at an all-male victory celebration. There is, however,

the possibility that "she" is a male priest. Some Sumerian priests were
known to wear wigs. Detail from the Standard of Ur. See another high
resolution photograph of the image. A similar figure occurs on a Sumerian
plaque from Mari that depicts the ceremonial sacrifice of a ram.
This person (second from the right) has sideburns, which seems to
indicate that it's a man.
This was the original attempt to restore the Great Lyre that shown at the
top of the page.
Several lyres were found in the Royal Tombs of Ur, along with the bodies
of the women
who played them. Woolley reports that one woman lay with her arm
draped across her lyre,
with the bones of her hand where the strings had been, as if playing it.

Detail of the bull's head on the Silver Lyre: The plaque on front of the
sounding box is made of shell. The head has inlaid eyes of shell and lapis
lazuli. The edges of the lyre are also trimmed with narrow borders of shell
and lapis lazuli. Since the figure on the front of the lyre isn't bearded, it
may actually be a "cow" rather than a "bull", though lyres of this type are
generally called "bull-headed lyres".

Lyre inlay on the Silver Lyre seen above. The top register shows two
rams feeding on the high branches of a tree. This image occurs on many
Sumerian artifacts and it seemed to have a symbolic meaning for the
Sumerians that is not fully understood today. The lower registers
show scenes of graphic violence in the natural world. This is a common
motif in Sumerian art and it can also be found on many cylinder seals.
Zamin (za3-mi2): This is the Sumerian
sign for lyre. It also means "to praise".

The Queen's Lyre: found in the tomb of Queen Pu-abi. The front panel,
made of lapis lazuli, shell and red limestone, was attached with bitumen
(bitumen is "tar" or "pitch"; the Sumerians used it as a kind of glue).
The mask of the bull is gold. While the horns are modern, the beard, hair
and eyes are original and made of lapis lazuli. The shape of the lyre is
meant to resemble a bull's body. Click here to see an enlargement of the

funeral ritual itself. At the top, the nude hero grapples with two rampant
human-headed bulls, representing royal control over nature. Beneath are
three scenes that show the ritual with otherworldly actors. A hyena
carries butchered meat on a table. Behind him is a lion, holding a jar and a
pouring vessel identical to ones found in the graves. The third register
depicts music-making: an equid plays a lyre while a bear supports it,
nearby a small animal shakes a rattle. The lyre depicted is similar to the
very lyre to which it was attached. On the bottom is the last stage of the
ritual, where the deceased meets the scorpion man, the guardian of the
entrance to the underworld."
Curiously, the hyena carrying butchered meat wears a dagger with a
studded handle like the one seen in the Weapons section. The lion also
carries a pouring bowl like those seen in the Vessels section.

in tone and structure. It's believed that the idea for a harp came from the
sound that a bowstring makes when the string is plucked.
The above picture shows Woolley's original reconstruction of the harp. He
later realized that it was actually a harp and a lyre that had been
compressed together by the weight of the soil. Below is a modern
reconstruction of the harp with the box structure removed.
Modern reconstruction of the Royal Harp.
One of Queen Pu-abi's cylinder seals shows a woman playing a harp,
accompanied by two other women who play cymbals and perhaps sing. It
would seem likely that the woman playing the harp is one of the
attendants who folllowed Pu-abi into the afterlife.

Silver "lamp". Leonard Woolley thought this was an oil-burning lamp,
but it's actually a pouring vessel, probably used for pouring libations
during religious ceremonies. Notice the eight‐pointed rosette, the same
one pictured on the bottom of the tumbler. Silver tumblers
similar to the gold one were also found in The Royal Tombs of Ur, with the
same rosette design. The rosette symbol is thought to have special
(perhaps magical) significance for the Sumerians. The motif occurs
frequently in their art, jewelry, and items of daily use. Diameter:
10.3 centimeters (approx. 4 inches).
The rosette squares on the Royal Game of Ur were considered lucky.

Death of Ur-Namma", lines 76-131). This is the reason why many feminine
articles (jewelry) were found in the graves of men, and many masculine
articles (daggers) were found in the graves of women.
Queen Pu-abi: When she was found by Leonard Woolley, 4,500 years
after she was buried, she was still wearing this elaborate headdress, and
the entire upper portion of her body was covered in jewelry.

Gold and lapis lazuli necklace. The Sumerians, more than any other
people in the world, loved lapis lazuli. For them, it represented fabulous
wealth, literally and as well as figuratively. It is not indigneous to Sumer,
and was mined in faraway Afghanistan. Because it had to be
imported over vast distances, it was very expensive.
Bull amulet. It was found lying loose in the soil outside one of the tombs.
Queen Pu-abi had similar amulets on her headdress. Height and width: 1.5

This helmet is made to look like the wearer's own hair, with a knotted bun

helmet were used for a cloth trim and to hold an interior lining. The
Akkadian king, Sargon the Great, wears a similar helmet. The same
kind of helmet is also worn by King Eannatum. This helmet was

tomb mention Meskalamdug, but the cylinder seal of Meskalamdug was
found in another royal tomb; so there's some confusion as to which is
really his tomb.
Meskalamdug, Sargon, and Eannatum were all "Kings of Kish". This is the
tradition title held by any king who ruled both Sumer and Akkad. For this
reason, I have identified this helmet
as belonging exclusively to the King of Kish, rather than merely being a
symbol of royalty,
as was originally supposed (see Helmet: the King of Kish).
Gold daggers: Several gold daggers were found in the Royal Tombs of
Ur. They are obviously "ceremonial", and not intended for use in combat.

Two copper spear points (left and right) and two harpoons. Woolley
called them harpoons, but their blunt points suggest a different purpose.
They were perhaps used as pole weapons. The blunt ends could be used to
push against the enemy's shields, without becoming embedded in them, to
push back their lines. The barbed end of the weapon could be used to

hook onto the rim of an enemy's shield and pull it down, thus leaving him
unprotected, to be finished off with a sword.
Copper spear point inscribed with an image of a lion. The holes in the
tang of the spearhead were used for attachment to the wooden shaft with
rivets. (This spear point wasn't found in the Royal Tombs of Ur, but it's
representative of ceremonial weapons meant only for display.) This
spear point was found in the city of Girsu.

The image of the lion is better seen with the point
turned upside down. See an enlarged view. The inscription on the
neck of the spear point has been damaged, and reads in part: "King ... King
of Kish".

Gold (electrum) and silver spear points. These are ceremonial
weapons, probably used in the procession of the king. Neither silver or
gold is hard enough to make an effecive weapon. Lengths: 34.5 and 17 cm
(13.6 and 6.7 inches).

Royal spears, with bands of silver and gold. They were found beside the
soldiers in the King's Grave. Although the spears are ceremonial, they
are the same kind of spears that were used in combat, with notches on the
ends for use with an atlati, a lever that allows the spear to be thrown with
much greater force. See an different photograph of the spears showing the
detail of the notches.

Copper spearhead. The blade has a bull-leg symbol inscribed on it, like
some of the bowls found in the Royal Tombs. The meaning of the symbol
isn't known, The shape of the point is similar to the spearheads on the
Standard of Ur (see the chariot scenes pictured below).
Length: 40 cm (15.75 inches).
Copper relief showing two lions trampling over the bodies of slain
enemy soldiers. Leonard Woolley considered this to be part of a shield
since it was found next to the soldiers in the King's Grave (PG 789).

where it was attached to the handle.
This has been labeled a "pickaxe". I would suggest that it is actually a
weapon rather than a construction tool because a cylinder seal impression
shows a similar weapon in a mythological battle scene. A wood handle was
inserted into the vertical hollow cylinder. Copper alloy 8.5 x 3.13 inches.

An electrum adze head, a copper adze head, and a copper axe
head. Electrum is a natural alloy of gold and silver. An adze is a tool used
in wood construction, but it was also used as a weapon of war, as indicated
by the fact that the electrum adze head was found with the soldiers. See a
color view of the axe heads.

Shell plaque of a Sumerian soldier with a battleaxe. This plaque, in
the Louvre, is from the city of Mari, and is dated 2500 B.C., the same time
period as the Royal Tombs of Ur. It has always been ascribed to be a
Sumerian "soldier", but I believe it's actually a king. The helmet
is the same as those worn by King Meskalamdug (seen above) and King
Eannatum, with the same knotted bun in the back, which is a symbol of
royalty. This kind of helmet wasn't worn by the common Sumerian soldier
(as shown on the Standard of Ur, below, and on Eannatum's victory stele).
Only kings were shown wearing this kind of helmet. The common soldiers
are only shown en masse, for instance, as part of a phalanx; only
a king would be individually portrayed. In any case, this is no ordinary
Sumerian soldier. It wouldn't be at all surprising if this was actually a
depiction of King Eannatum. Although Eannatum was the king of Lagash,
he also conquered Mari, where this plaque was found. He was also the

King of Kish. The estimated date of the plaque matches
the dates of Eannatum's reign, 2454 - 2425 B.C. It is also done in the same
artistic style as other portraits of Eannatum. See the original plaque.
King Eannatum wears the same kind of
helmet, with a knotted bun in the back. He also carries a curved sickle
sword, which is better seen in a separate picture.
This shell plaque is from the Royal Tombs of Ur. It is in the Baghdad
Museum. Surprisingly, it is labeled simply as a "human figurine", without
any mention of it being a king. It looks very similar to the plaque of
Eannatum shown above. Another possibility for the identity of this
figure is Mesanepada, the king of Ur who also conquered Mari during this
period of history. See the Standard of Mari page on this website.

Sumerian war chariots:
A Sumerian soldier unharnesses the king's chariot from a team of
horses. Detail from the Standard of Ur. The soldier carries a battleaxe; his
leather armor is draped over his shoulder. The horses are caparisoned
with the same kind of leather armor.
Sumerian "war wagon". It is a two-man vehicle. One soldier did the
driving, the other soldier did the fighting; although the drivers sometimes
fought as well (they're seen wielding weapons
in the two lead chariots). Detail from the Standard of Ur.

Model of a two-wheeled Sumerian chariot, with chariot rein post and
rings. The model of the chariot shows the image of a god on its interior
panel. It is from a later period (Neo-Sumerian, circa 2000 B.C.). The rein
post rings were used to separate the reins of a chariot, as illustrated above.

Sumerian rein post and rings. "This rein ring is one of several found
in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. Leonard Woolley, the archaeologist,
discovered the remains of a sledge in the 'Queen's Grave', partly decorated
with a mosaic of shell, lapis lazuli and red limestone and gold heads
of lions and bulls. This rein ring was found among the bones of the two
oxen lying in front of the sledge. It would have originally been fixed to a
wooden pole, now decayed, running from the front of the chariot or sledge
between the animals. The reins were threaded through the rings to collars
worn by the oxen"; excerpt from the British Museum. This rein post is
made of electrum and silver. Height: 13.5 cm (5.3 inches).

Limestone bas-relief of a two-wheel chariot, from a temple in the city of
Ur. It's always been assumed that the Sumerians used two-wheeled
chariots on the battlefield for communication and command. Apparently
they were also used for combat, since this chariot is equipped with spears,
javelins, and "Syrian" battleaxes. The chariot is decorated with a
leopard skin. The scene is religious, since the chariot is drawn by
four eagle-headed lions (griffins) rather than horses. This suggests it is the
chariot of a god, possibly Ningirsu, since it's a war chariot and griffins are
his symbolic animals. Note the curved central shaft of the chariot yoke
that goes between the team of lions. On top of the shaft is a rein post and
rings. See a labeled picture of the chariot.
Sumerian war chariot (reconstructed). Detail from the Standard of Ur.
The chariot is equipped with the same kind of spears pictured above.

The "ball" that's seen in front of the horses is actually a nose ring. The
Sumerians didn't use "bit bridles" in the modern sense of the word;
instead they used nose rings to control the horses' movements. The nose
rings are clearly visible on the pictures above. The rings are
sometimes mistaken to be the decorative end of the chariot's central shaft,
but the rings can also be found on other horses on the standard that are
not pulling a chariot. In the above picture, the ring has been turned 90
degrees toward the viewer to show its shape. The "vertical" lines on the
ring shows where the reins are attached.
